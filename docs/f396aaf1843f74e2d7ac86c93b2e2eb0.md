Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, LCpl Cody Gordon Watson, 21, of 
Oxford, Alabama, died on December 6, 2006, in Iraq. Lance Corporal 
Watson was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment, 2nd 
Marine Division, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. His survivors include 
his mother and father Linda S. and Dennis B. Watson of Anniston, 
Alabama.

Lance Corporal Watson was known for his upbeat and dedicated spirit. 
Like all soldiers, he dutifully left behind his family and loved ones 
to serve our country overseas.



Words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family, and 
for the gratitude our country feels for his service. Lance Corporal 
Watson, like other brave men and women who have served in uniform, died 
serving not just the United States, but the entire cause of liberty. 
Indeed, he was a true American.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve our Nation.
