Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Steven Shulz joined the United States Marine 
Corps after 9/11 and wanted, as he said, ''to strengthen the United 
States military.''

He did two tours of duty in Iraq, and in 2005 he was wounded by an 
IED in Fallujah. He had traumatic brain injury and was given up for 
dead.

Mr. Speaker, last rites were actually given for him. But Corporal 
Shulz refused to die, even though he has permanent brain injury, a weak 
left side, and is blind in one eye. No one ever expected Steven to even 
walk; but he continues to go through rehab, and his recovery is 
remarkable due to awesome medical personnel.

At a ceremony at the Baylor College of Medicine on Veterans Day, 
Corporal Shulz was presented with keys to a new home, especially 
designed and built for him, thanks to Houston area Rotary Clubs and 
benefactors in the Houston area.

It was a thrill for me and other Members of Congress to be present to 
see this young American hero. I was so impressed by his positive 
attitude and his love for America. He told me he would go back to Iraq 
and do it all over again if necessary.

Amazing men, these young guns of the United States Marine Corps.

And that's just the way it is.
