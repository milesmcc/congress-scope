`Mr. BACA â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to revise and 
extend my remarks.

I'd like to thank my colleagues, Congressman Tanner and Congressman 
Abercrombie, for their hard work on this issue and their dedication to 
a new direction forward in Iraq.

I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3087.

Mr. Speaker, a change of course in Iraq is long overdue.

The cost of this war is already too high. America has spent over $455 
billion and lost more than 3,700 lives in Iraq.

This responsible legislation would require the President and senior 
administration officials to develop and submit a comprehensive 
redeployment strategy to Congress within 60 days, and every 90 days 
thereafter.

Additionally, this bill recognizes that the U.S. Armed Forces and 
U.S. civilians have worked valiantly, and that it is time for Iraq to 
manage its future.

The bill also notes that when Congress authorized military force in 
2002, it was concerned about an Iraqi government that has since been 
removed from power.

The brave men and women of America's armed forces have served their 
country valiantly and will continue to do so.

But it is time to bring them home from Iraq.

We must refocus our mission on the global threat of terrorism.

As a veteran, I voted against this war in 2002 because no one could 
convince me why we needed to be there.

Now, after five years of the President's failed policies, Congress 
must take action.

I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for a new direction in Iraq and 
for the future security of America, and support H.R. 3087.
