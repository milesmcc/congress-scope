`Mr. REID â€” 29 March 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I failed to announce, but it was very 
important, those numbers that we read off were two very important 
ambassadorships: Ford M. Fraker, to be the Ambassador to the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia; Zalmay Khalilzad, who, of course, has served so well in 
Iraq and is now going to be the Ambassador to the United Nations. That 
is very important, and I am glad we did that.


One thing I did not mention is, for all Senators and staff, our 
Democratic caucus, which is normally held on Tuesday, we are going to 
have that on Wednesday. It is obvious now, with no votes on Tuesday, 
that is probably the right thing to do. So, for all Democrats, we will 
have our caucus on Wednesday.
