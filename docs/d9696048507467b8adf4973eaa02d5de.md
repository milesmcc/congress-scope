Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2929) to limit the use of funds to establish any military 
installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent 
stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq or to exercise United 
States economic control of the oil resources of Iraq.
