Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we know that in the 1960s and 1970s we 
committed our troops to Vietnam. But we found out at the end of the 
war, after 2 weeks of constant carpet bombing of Hanoi when Sam Johnson 
was leaving the Hanoi Hilton, he was told, You silly Americans, if 
you'd kept bombing us for 1 more week like that, we would have had to 
surrender unconditionally.

The message of Vietnam should be either commit 100 percent or get 
out. Don't leave people out there to die without full commitment.

Now we have people on the left saying, get out of Afghanistan now. We 
have people on the right saying, do whatever it takes to win. And I'm 
here to say, Mr. Speaker, the President should not keep going on talk 
shows and going around the world while he has a report suggesting what 
to do. He needs to commit 100 percent to the war in Afghanistan, give 
them everything they need, or get out now.
