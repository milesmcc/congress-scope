Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the morning's newspapers 
chronicle the happy fact that the American journalist Roxana Saberi was 
released from prison in Iran. This is a happy occasion, certainly for 
her and for her family, as she has been in Iran since 2003. She has 
been a journalist for National Public Radio and the BBC. She ostensibly 
was arrested by virtue of having bought a bottle of wine and the 
charges were later elevated to working without press credentials and 
espionage.

The fact is the U.S. Government weighed in on this. Secretary 
Clinton, in a meeting with one of the high Iranian officials that had 
been called to a conference on Afghanistan in the Hague, the United 
States handed the Iranian diplomats a letter calling for the release of 
Ms. Saberi and, along with that, in that letter, calling for the 
release of Bob Levinson and Esha Momeni. Bob Levinson is from Florida. 
He has a wife and seven children. He disappeared from the island of 
Kish over 2 years ago. We have reason to believe he is being held in a 
prison, perhaps the very same prison where Ms. Saberi was held. Each 
time his name is brought up to any Iranian officials, be it by me, be 
it by any other representative of the United States, the standard line 
is: We don't know anything about him, but usually that Iranian official 
will then change the subject to the three Iranians being held by the 
Americans in Irbil, Iran.

If they are suggesting some kind of exchange by consistently doing 
this--whether it is with American officials or whether it is with the 
Swiss officials who represent us in Tehran; whatever it is--the release 
of Ms. Saberi is certainly a good first step. If the Iranians want a 
better relationship with the United States, clearly the new 
administration has offered that. Now it is up to the Iranian officials. 
They did the right thing by releasing Ms. Saberi yesterday. If they 
want to additionally show a humanitarian gesture of returning a father 
and a husband to his wife and seven children, what better chance than 
to release Bob Levinson.

This Senator has met with the Iranian Ambassador to the United 
Nations and, of course, received no information, even though the 
Iranian Ambassador was very gracious in his hospitality. Perhaps he did 
not even know, because in some of the information I expressed to him, 
he expressed surprise. Whoever knows about it, whatever compartmented 
part of the Iranian Government knows about it, it is now time. If Iran 
wants to have a better relationship with the United States, this would 
be the next humanitarian gesture: release Bob Levinson.

Madam President, I yield the floor.
