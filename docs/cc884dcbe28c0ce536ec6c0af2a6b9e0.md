Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to offer my thanks as well to the 
distinguished majority leader of the Senate for his comments and his 
support of the amendment that I am about to address, as well as my 
friend and colleague, the distinguished junior Senator from Virginia.

The war in Iraq has pushed the U.S. military to the breaking point. 
Our troops are being deployed longer than they should be, more 
frequently than they should be, and without full training and 
equipment. When we deploy our military, the President and the Congress 
have a responsibility, an obligation to ensure that our troops are 
rested, ready, fully trained, and fully equipped.

Senator Webb and I have introduced this amendment to protect and 
maintain the readiness and strength of our Armed Forces. Our amendment 
requires, with the force of law, that our


troops are only deployed to Iraq when they meet the military's own 
standards for readiness and deployment. We are not creating new 
standards. We are simply requiring that the military's own standards be 
met so that our men and women in uniform are sufficiently rested, 
ready, fully equipped, and fully trained when deployed.

That is the President's and the Congress's responsibility. No 
American wants to allow a single soldier to be deployed without meeting 
the required standards of readiness. Our amendment gives the President 
appropriate flexibility. Our amendment has a 4-month delay, before the 
provisions come into force, to give the President time to comply.

The President can waive the readiness requirement in case of a 
national emergency and under circumstances where a unit will receive 
its full complement of equipment in the theatre of operations. Our 
amendment exempts from the deployment cap all headquarters personnel 
and any other U.S. military personnel who are needed in Iraq to ensure 
continuity of mission between rotating forces.

This amendment will help our troops in a way that avoids having 
unintended operational consequences for our commanders in Iraq. Our 
amendment is about our troops. It is about readiness. It is about 
preventing our troops from being extended 3, 4, 5 or 6 months, as has 
been and is currently the case today. It is about ensuring a minimum 
time home between deployments.

This amendment is also about addressing deployment rotations of our 
troops in Iraq. Many are there for their third and fourth tours of 
duty. The United States will not be able to sustain the greatest all-
volunteer military that the world has ever known if we allow the status 
quo to continue.

We are witnessing a clear and dangerous consequence of the 
administration's Iraq policy in Army recruitment. To meet recruitment 
targets, the military is being forced to issue waivers today. These 
waivers are for violent offenders, criminals, and for drug abuse. We 
are waving education requirements. The result is a defining down, a 
defining down of the standards of the U.S. Army. No institution can 
maintain any aspect of excellence by dumbing down its standards. If we 
do not stop this dangerous trend, it will affect the entire institution 
of our military, an institution that has taken great American leaders 
30 years to build.

After the disaster of Vietnam, our military was shredded. Ask Colin 
Powell. Ask Norman Schwarzkopf. Ask other great military leaders who, 
in fact, after Vietnam said: No more. We are going to build the finest, 
greatest, most responsible, best force structure the world has ever 
known, and they did.

The deployment and operations tempo our military has had to endure in 
both Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 4 years cannot be sustained 
without inflicting unacceptable costs to our military power and our 
standing and influence around the world.

As the Washington Post reported today, General Barry McCaffrey, the 
former four-star commander of the U.S. Southern Command, tours in 
Vietnam, led a division in 1991 in the Gulf War, he now believes--
according to the article in today's Washington Post--that the U.S. 
military is in, his words, ''strategic peril.''

Yesterday, LTG Steven Blum, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, 
testified before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. 
General Blum said the National Guard is, in his words:




. . . now in a degraded state back at home . . . The Army 


 National Guard has on-hand only 40 percent of its equipment 


 requirement . . . This hinders the ability of our units to 


 train. It also can slow our response to disasters and 


 terrorist incidents in the homeland.


In February, GEN Peter Schoomaker, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. 
Army, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. General 
Schoomaker said: ''I am not satisfied with the readiness of our non-
deployed forces.''

At the same hearing, GEN Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, acknowledged that today our Army units ''do not have the 
opportunity that they would normally have in a two-year cycle to train 
for the combined arms that they may be required to execute elsewhere in 
the world.''

On March 1, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves issued 
a report that concluded that: Nearly 90 percent of Army National Guard 
units are rated as--their words--''not ready.''

There have been repeated reports that senior Army officials now 
believe there are no nondeployed Army brigades who are rated as combat 
ready.

Now in our fifth year of the war in Iraq, the Congress must assert 
itself in a very real and responsible way to fulfill our constitutional 
responsibilities in matters of war as a coequal branch of our 
Government.

Over the last 4 years, the Congress has been absent from this 
responsibility. The American people now expect us to step into this 
tragedy that we have allowed to happen and begin to reshape our policy 
in Iraq by placing responsible conditions on our continued military 
involvement in this war in Iraq.

We are abusing our all-volunteer force in a dangerous and 
irresponsible way. We are abusing our people. We are abusing their 
families. We cannot continue to burden our military by continuing to 
place our military in the middle of a civil war in Iraq and loading 
onto them, continuing to load onto our military, expectations that they 
are incapable of fulfilling.

We are asking our military to accomplish things they cannot 
accomplish, not because they are not brave enough, not because they 
haven't fought valiantly--they have fought valiantly and we are proud 
of them--but it is new diplomatic initiatives that must now drive our 
policies in Iraq. There will not be--nor cannot be--a military victory 
in Iraq that will achieve peace or any form of stability or security 
for the Iraqi people or the Middle East.

The future of Iraq will be determined by the political accommodations 
of the people of Iraq which will result in a political resolution that 
will be supported by the Iraqi people, its regional neighbors, and 
other powers, including the United States. Our military should not be 
asked to do it all. Our military should not be expected to do it all. 
They have done more than their part.

Our men and women in uniform and their families deserve policy worthy 
of their sacrifice. I do not believe that to be the case today. 
Unfortunately, today the Senate will not vote on our amendment. But 
Senator Webb and I are committed to this amendment, and we will 
continue to push for a vote in the Senate in the coming weeks, and we 
will be back and we will be back.

We have been assured by the majority leader that we will get a vote 
on this amendment in the Senate. I conclude with this: I often ask 
myself, who speaks for the rifleman? Who cares about the rifleman? War 
is not a distraction. Those whom we ask to go fight and die are a very 
small percentage of our population whom we ask to carry all the burden 
and make all the sacrifices. But who speaks for them?


Of course, we have a responsibility for a larger geopolitical 
strategic policy for our interests. We have interests in Iraq. We have 
interests in the world. We have interests in the Middle East. But do we 
ever stop enough and listen enough and focus enough on these soldiers, 
these marines and their families who have nothing to say about policy; 
but they do what their country asks them to do.

When we frame policy in Washington, part of that prospective of 
framing that policy must include the right because it must ultimately 
get to this question: Is the cost worth what we are attempting to 
accomplish? Is the cost worth the high price we are asking others to 
pay?

Ultimately, that is the question we should always ask ourselves, 
those of us who have the privilege and the responsibility to frame 
policy--if Congress must be part of that--not just constitutionally but 
morally, but morally.

We each represent constituencies from around this country. We are 
close to those constituencies. We mirror those constituencies. We are 
products of those constituencies. We are close to those constituencies. 
We must do better for our military. We will pay a high price if we do 
not turn this around. We will pay a high price, indeed, not just in 
America's blood and treasure but for our future interests and security 
in the world.

We have not paid attention to our military, we have not paid 
attention to


the rifleman, and now is the time to start paying attention. I 
appreciate the time to offer this amendment with my friend and 
colleague who, as the majority leader noted minutes ago, was one of the 
most decorated veterans of the Vietnam war. He understands this issue 
very well. He understands it from the bottom up.

It does not mean Senator Webb and Senator Hagel are always right on 
anything. But we do try to bring a frame of reference to this debate 
that is relevant, that is important, and focus our attention on the 
very critical element of who we are. It is our people. Nothing is more 
important than our people.

I yield the floor.
