Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to submit S. 
Res. 505, along with Mr. Brownback. It is my hope it will be considered 
hot-lined on both sides and passed later this afternoon.

This resolution is a commendation resolution on behalf of the 
University of Kansas Men's Basketball Team for winning the 2008 
National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, Division I, basketball 
championship as of last night.

This might be a little unique in that I am a graduate of Kansas State 
University, home of the ever-optimistic and fighting Wildcats. 
Sometimes we are rivals. In this particular case, all of Kansas, 
including every K State fan, stands in salute of the Jayhawks. It is 
clearly ''Rock Chalk, Jayhawk'' time in Kansas.

Mr. President, I will skip to the bottom line of the resolution, 
where it says:




 Whereas, the families of the players, students, alumni, and 


 faculty of the University of Kansas, and all the supporters 


 of the University of Kansas, are to be congratulated for 


 their commitment to, and pride in, the basketball program at 


 the university: Now, therefore be it resolved the Senate 


 commends the University of Kansas men's basketball team for 


 winning the 2008 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship.


The Secretary of the Senate will transmit enrolled copies of this 
resolution to the University of Kansas so they can display it; the 
chancellor of the university, Bob Hemenway, a great friend; the 
athletic director of the university, Lew Perkins; and the head coach of 
the team, Bill Self, who should remain at the University of Kansas. 
Those remarks were not prepared, but that is my advice.

For those of you who did not see the game last night--and it started 
at 9 p.m. and I know most Senators are probably asleep at 9 o'clock at 
night--trailing 60 to 51, with 2:12 seconds left in regulation, Kansas 
closed the second half with a 12-3 run, capped off by a Mario Chalmers' 
three-point basket, with 2.1 seconds remaining to force overtime. 
Kansas then outscored Memphis 12 to 5 in overtime to claim its third 
national championship.

As General Petraeus is here testifying before four committees in 
regard to national security and the war with Iraq, and when this Senate 
is considering a housing bill and stimulus package to help the economy, 
let us hope the example of the University of Kansas men's basketball 
team, in regard to their perseverance and dedication, will enable us to 
achieve our goals as well.

If you listen hard, from the mountains from which our acting 
Presiding Officer is so familiar, from Montana and further west, on to 
the high plains, to the Midwest, across the Appalachians, and clear to 
the east coast and our Nation's capital--if you listen hard, you can 
hear that chant, ''Rock Chalk, Jayhawk, KU-U-U.'' If we listen hard, 
maybe we can work together, follow their example of perseverance and 
unbelievable heroics to win the NCAA championship. Thus, sayeth this 
champion of Kansas State athletics on behalf of the University of 
Kansas and their basketball team.
