Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the plan for General 
Petraeus' surge was designed to improve Iraq's security so that 
political and economic progress could follow. Stability measures 
implemented in violent areas in and around Baghdad and across the 
nation have produced recognizable results.

There is an increased security in Iraq, and optimistic reports are 
traveling back from Members of Congress, war critics, and, yes, even 
the liberal press. Areas once considered terrorist strongholds are now 
relatively secure. Progress. Sunni and U.S. forces are working together 
for victory. Progress. Tribal leaders are turning their backs on 
terrorist insurgents and helping American forces. Progress.

Next week, General Petraeus will deliver a comprehensive report on 
Iraq and what the surge has produced since he has been on the ground, 
and I am confident his report will be detailed and honest.

Mr. Speaker, the level of progress is evident, and I believe the 
continued success of the surge will pave the way for the only way out 
of Iraq: Victory.
