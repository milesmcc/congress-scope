Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I regret that I was unable to be 
present to vote for the final passage of H.R. 3326, the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010, but had I been 
present, I would have supported it.

This Act will provide $636.3 billion in funding for the Department of 
Defense, including nearly $125 billion in funds that will directly 
support the men and women fighting at the frontlines of this Nation's 
wars. I am honored to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
which drafted the law authorizing these funds, and thank my colleagues 
on the Senate Appropriations Committee, led by Chairman Daniel Inouye, 
for their hard work guiding this bill to its final approval.

This bill will do much to both protect our service members overseas 
and improve their lives at home. It will provide $6.3 billion to 
procure additional


mine resistant ambush protected, MRAP, vehicles and more than 6,600 
MRAP all-terrain vehicles, MRAP-ATVs, which will save countless lives 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. For our service members and their families, it 
will also provide a 3.4-percent pay raise, additional funding for the 
Defense Health Program, and $120 million to support research for 
traumatic brain injury and psychological health research.

I am particularly proud of the critical role that Connecticut plays 
in supporting our Nation's defense, a role that this act reaffirms. 
Connecticut workers are essential to building critical equipment and 
systems that account for nearly 15 percent of the $104.4 billion in 
procurement funds provided in this bill. These include the Virginia 
class submarine, the Blackhawk family of utility helicopters, the 
engines that power the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the powerful radar on 
the Joint STARS aircraft, and even the Colt carbine that our soldiers 
carry at the frontlines of battle. There truly is a Connecticut worker 
supporting every member of the U.S. Armed Forces.
