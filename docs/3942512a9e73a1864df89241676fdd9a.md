Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, for those who would support House Concurrent 
Resolution 63, I ask, what is your plan? ''No'' is not a plan.

We have three options to follow. The first is to stay the course. I 
don't know of anyone, including the President, who is suggesting we 
take that route. The second is to increase the troops level, which the 
supporters of House Concurrent Resolution 63 are saying no to. The only 
other option is to reduce troops.

I would ask you who will support House Concurrent Resolution 63, read 
the Baker-Hamilton report, a bipartisan report, that talks about the 
effects that will occur if we do withdraw from Iraq. There will be 
widespread violence there, more than we are seeing today. And they warn 
us that a withdrawal may require the U.S. to engage, once again, in 
Iraq to stabilize that area.

So for those of you who would support House Concurrent Resolution 63, 
I again ask, what is your plan? ''No'' is not a plan.
