## `0a1bed6a55613645ac4b719fdb68ea04`
`Mr. BURTON of Indiana â€” 7 February 2007`

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Well, if he has no more speakers, I am 
prepared to


yield back the balance of my time. But I just want to say to my 
colleagues from Illinois, and I say this in a good-natured way, if you 
need a Colts hat, I just happen to have a few in my office. I will be 
very happy to buy you one.

But I still want my deep-dish pizza, my cheesecake, and I want to 
make sure those DVDs get to the troops in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
