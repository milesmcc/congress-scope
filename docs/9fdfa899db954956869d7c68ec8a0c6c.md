`Mr. REID â€” 29 March 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier this week the Senate took an 
important step for our troops and for the security of our Nation. For 
the first time since this ill-conceived war began more than 4 years 
ago, a bipartisan majority of the Senate told the President to change 
course in Iraq. As the American people know, this war has lasted going 
into 5 years, costing the lives of more than 3,200 Americans and tens 
of thousands of wounded troops, many of whom I met yesterday at Walter 
Reed. It has also depleted our Treasury of over $400 billion.

Despite these facts and the brave sacrifice of our troops, the 
violence continues unabated in Iraq. Our troops are enmeshed in an 
unquestionable civil war. The people who attacked us on 9/11 have not 
been brought to justice, and America is less secure today than it was 
on 9/11.

After all of that, one would think every Member of this body would 
recognize we are on the wrong path. The more we look at this, it is 
clear that more of the same will not produce a different result; that 
success requires a different course. As General Petraeus has said, 
there is no military solution in Iraq. In fact, he said only 20 percent 
can be solved militarily; the rest has to be solved diplomatically and 
economically. That is clear.

Unfortunately, as evidenced by the votes of many of my Republican 
colleagues and the words of the minority leader on the floor earlier 
today, this is not the case. There are still too many Members of this 
body, including the minority leader, who are willing to give this 
administration a blank check and a green light to proceed down this 
failed path. It is a long path, with failure every step of the way.

The supplemental spending bill contains an important change of course 
in the President's Iraq policy, something we, as a separate, 
independent branch of Government, have the right to do. Our Founding 
Fathers, when they drafted the Constitution 220 years ago, set forth 
the few words that have directed this country for more than two 
centuries: that there would be three separate branches of Government, 
not any one more powerful than the other--the House and the Senate make 
up the legislative branch, the judiciary, and executive branches of 
Government.

We have every right to do what we did. For 6 plus years the President 
has ignored us. The Republican House and Senate have given him 
everything he has wanted. But now there is a new Congress. He can't do 
that anymore. We have constitutional responsibilities. We have to 
fulfill those responsibilities.

On November 7 the American people spoke very clearly. They said: We 
want a change of course in Iraq. That is what we legislated this week.

The supplemental spending bill contains important changes in the 
course of the President's Iraq policy. Given the importance and urgency 
of this legislation, I am surprised to hear the minority leader 
discredit this bill and the need to change course in Iraq the way he 
did earlier today. Senate Democrats believe our troops should get the 
funding they need without further delay. The only question is whether 
President Bush and the Senate Republicans will prevent that from 
happening.

The Senate has now acted and the ball is squarely in the President's 
court. However, before even being presented with the final version of 
the legislation, the President has promised a veto. This appears to be 
nothing more than a strategy designed to score political points, not 
doing a thing to assist the troops. I am sorry the minority leader has 
become a facilitator of that strategy.

Senate Democrats will continue to fight to provide the troops the 
funds they need and a real strategy for success. We have taken an 
important step in that direction this week, and we will continue to 
press the President and congressional Republicans to join us in this 
effort.

This is our constitutional responsibility. I am disappointed and 
somewhat in a state of disbelief that our President would threaten a 
veto without even seeing the final legislation. We have obligations, 
and we are going to fulfill those obligations.

Does the Senator from Pennsylvania wish to speak?
