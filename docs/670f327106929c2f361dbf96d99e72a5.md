Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I cannot support the procedure that the 
majority and minority leaders have concocted to speed a supplemental 
spending bill to conference without debate or amendments--and without 
even writing the actual bill. I share the desire of my colleagues to 
pass this important bill as soon as possible. But that is no excuse for 
us avoiding our responsibilities as legislators. Passing a symbolic 
resolution is not an acceptable alternative to writing, considering and 
working to improve legislation that provides tens of billions of 
dollars for a broad range of programs and that addresses the most 
pressing issue facing the country--the President's disastrous policies 
in Iraq.

When it comes to legislation as important as this, we need full 
debate and votes. We can do this quickly--I am prepared to have this 
debate and consider amendments right away, and to stay as long as it 
takes to get it done. But we should do it openly and on the record. The 
votes we had yesterday on Iraq amendments to an unrelated bill are no 
excuse for bypassing the regular legislative process today.

I admit, it is easier and quicker if we just send a placeholder bill 
to conference, so that the real work can be done there. But we do a 
disservice to our constituents, and to this institution, by passing the 
buck like that. The American people are calling on us to end the war in 
Iraq. They deserve to see this debate, even if it slows us down by a 
few hours. They deserve to know where their Senators stand, and which 
amendments they support. A decision about whether to continue our 
involvement in this misguided war should be made in open debate, not 
behind closed doors--particularly since neither house will have the 
opportunity to amend whatever final legislation emerges from 
conference.

The first supplemental that Congress recently passed was a step 
forward toward ending this war. I am concerned that the bill that 
emerges from the upcoming conference, thanks to this expedited 
procedure, will be a step back. Passing a weak supplemental bill that 
expresses disapproval of the President's policies but doesn't do 
anything to fix them may make some of us feel better. But this debate 
should not be about providing political comfort for folks here in 
Washington. It is about responding to the wishes of the American people 
and the needs of our national security. And it should take place on the 
Senate floor, before the American people, right here, right now.



I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
