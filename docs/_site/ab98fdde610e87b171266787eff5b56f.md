Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to 
reduce the size of this bill, the cost of this bill.

I have got to tell you I grew up in the late 1970s. I remember pretty 
distinctly the policies of Jimmy Carter. I remember the high 
unemployment rates. I remember the high inflation rates.

I recall getting my driver's license and getting that 1970 station 
wagon to drive and waiting in a line for gas two blocks long; and when 
you got there, there was one pump yet working and the others had the 11 
by 8 piece of paper that said ''out of gas'' on it. I think those are 
the policies which some of my friends on the left are advocating today. 
I just have to openly wonder how well Honda Civics would work in the 
sand in Iraq if we can't use military vehicles because of their gas 
mileage.

But let's get back to the real issue of what we're talking about here 
today, and that's ways of controlling spending. Yes, it is showing a 
difference between the majority party and the minority party in the 
sense of spending.

We are here fighting to reduce the size of their bill. We would like 
to bring it to last year's level where it was only a 1.6 percent 
increase, and they were yakking about how we needed to spend more, and 
when they got in control, they were able to do that.

They have a bill here before us today that increases the spending way 
above the President's request. This amendment just simply brings it 
down, $1.13 billion to the President's request. So either way we can 
fight to reduce the size of their bills, and last week's bill. Again, 
they were both double-digit increases.

I think this type of debate is healthy. It also does show, as one of 
the previous speakers mentioned, that there are policy differences. 
There are priority differences between the two parties, and we are 
showing how we are the party of fiscal responsibility.
