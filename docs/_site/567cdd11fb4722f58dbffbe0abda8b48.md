Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would simply prevent the 
State Department from continuing to selectively ignore Federal statute.

The Federal statute in question instructs the State Department to 
discontinue the issuance of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas to 
citizens of countries who refuse our attempts to repatriate or deport 
their nationals. As I mentioned, the State Department often chooses to 
disregard this statute.

In fact, some dozen nations around the world routinely refuse to 
accept their citizens who have come here illegally or violated the 
terms of their visas. Iraq is just one example. As a result, Iraqi 
aliens who would otherwise be deported are free to remain in the United 
States.

Last year, I sent a letter to Secretary Chertoff asking why an Iraqi 
national by the name of Gavan Alkadi was not deported but instead was 
released into the public. Gavan Alkadi have been convicted of an 
aggravated felony and has been arrested nearly 70 times in Colorado.
