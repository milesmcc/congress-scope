Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I express my strong support for the 
conference report on the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. I also 
take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Conrad and the other 
conferees for their hard work on this resolution. This resolution 
reflects our commitment to fully fund veterans' health care and 
benefits.

This budget resolution would provide $43.1 billion in fiscal year 
2008 for the VA discretionary account--$3.6 billion more than the 
President requested. I am very pleased that the conference report 
follows the recommendations of the Democratic and Independent members 
of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to provide $2.9 billion over the 
President's request for veterans' medical care alone. This includes an 
additional $303 million for treatment of traumatic brain injuries, and 
$693 million for VA mental health programs--two areas of vital 
importance to servicemembers returning from Operations Iraqi and 
Enduring Freedom.

I also thank the Budget Committees for rejecting the President's 
proposals to impose an annual enrollment fee for VA health care and to 
increase the prescription drug copayment. These proposals would have 
unduly burdened thousands of veterans who cannot afford higher costs 
for the health care they have earned and deserve.

I again commend Chairman Conrad and the other conferees for their 
work on the budget resolution, and for sending the right message to our 
Nation's veterans. We have made a commitment to their care, and this 
resolution honors that commitment. I urge my colleagues to support 
swift passage of the resolution before us today.
