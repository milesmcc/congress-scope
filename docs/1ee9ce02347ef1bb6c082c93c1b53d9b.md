Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Levin.

This is the second week, as we know, we are on this bill. We have not 
gotten to many of the amendments that have anything to do with other 
aspects of defending this Nation besides the issue of Iraq. I look 
forward to working with him as we can try to not break a 45-year custom 
here that we provide the much needed authorization for the men and 
women in our defense establishment and provide for our Nation's 
security, which I think we all agree is our highest priority.

So, if I may continue the colloquy for just one moment, I know that 
there are--now we will be beginning, and I will give a statement after 
the chairman, if it is his desire, and then we will have speakers 
coming all day long on either side of this issue. I know many want to 
speak, and I hope they will be prepared to do so.
