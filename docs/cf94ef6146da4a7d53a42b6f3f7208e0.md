Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are not leaving the Energy bill. 
Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, offered the Republicans to return 
to that bill immediately. This isn't going to take 60 hours, unless the 
Republican side decides to drag it out forever. It doesn't have to. It 
can take a much shorter period of time.

The bottom line is still this: Are we ready to spend money here in 
America to solve some of our own problems or are we going to keep 
shipping this money overseas to rebuild an Iraqi economy that already 
has more oil than most nations on Earth? Why don't we spend money here 
for medical research, making it safer for our kids to go on the 
Internet, or trying to find runaway children?

I think investments in America make us stronger, and that is what 
this vote will be all about. Those who make the argument to vote 
against it are voting against investment in America.
