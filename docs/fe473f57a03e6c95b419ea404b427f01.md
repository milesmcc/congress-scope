`Mr. HENSARLING â€” 5 September 2007`

---


Mr. HENSARLING. I certainly thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank 
the gentleman from Tennessee for leading this hour. I want to thank the 
other members of the Republican Study Committee, the House's 
conservative caucus, for lending their voice here.

In the remaining time, I just want to make a couple of points, and 
that is, we see every night the cost of fighting this war, and it is a 
heavy cost. It's a heavy cost in terms of money and, much more 
importantly, lives. But we need to again remember the cost of losing 
this war and what that could mean and how serious the threat is.

I was home during the August recess, got to spend time not only with 
my wife and children, but with my parents. My mother reminded me of 
something that she said from time to time, and that is, sometimes life 
is full of lousy options. And yes, fighting this war is costly. But 
losing this war could be even costlier if Iraq becomes what Afghanistan 
once was, under the Taliban, a breeding ground, a training ground for 
terrorists that are bent on hurting our country.

And we have to remember these are people who have said they have the 
right to kill 4 million Americans. Two million of them are children and 
two of those 2 million are mine. We have to remember what the cost of 
defeat is.

So we finally have signs for cautious optimism. We all need to have 
an open mind when the report comes in.
