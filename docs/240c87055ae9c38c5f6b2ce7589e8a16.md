# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `240c87055ae9c38c5f6b2ce7589e8a16`
`Mr. SKELTON â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. SKELTON. After 8 long years, we finally have a strategy for 
success in Afghanistan, and we have a President who has appointed the 
right leaders in General McChrystal and Ambassador Eikenberry, who's 
willing to provide those leaders with the military and civilian experts 
that they need.

Success is not guaranteed in this mission, but passing this 
resolution guarantees failure in Afghanistan and poses a serious risk 
that we will once again face the same situation that existed on 
September 11, 2001. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposition to 
this resolution.
