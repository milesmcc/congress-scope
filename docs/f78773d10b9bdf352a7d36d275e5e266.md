Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a fallen 
hero who was laid to rest in my district earlier this month.

Senior Airman Ashton Goodman was killed by a roadside bomb in 
Afghanistan on May 26. Her ultimate sacrifice is a stark reminder of 
the human cost of war. However, it is Ashton's life that should serve 
as a shining example of American achievement in Afghanistan.

While tasked with protecting vital reconstruction teams, Ashton 
worked to win over the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. She 
regularly mentored Afghan women, providing them with the guidance and 
skills needed to stand up against oppression and violence. Because of 
Ashton, many women are now combating the economic and social conditions 
that breed extremism.

Through her exceptional support of Afghan women and her sacrifice on 
behalf of her country, she has set a lasting example for our military 
and for all Americans.
