Mr. BOCCIERI. Madam Speaker, as Chairman Berman has said, I am one of 
just a handful of Members who have served in Afghanistan. I remember 
serving on the ground there as I was deployed as a tactics officer in 
Operation Vigilant Sentinel. As a C-130 pilot, they sent some forward-
deployed troops there to make sure that our troops got the right 
supplies, and that the missions that we were doing were safe, and that 
our crews would come home very honorably and soon.

I have to tell you that I remember that day walking to the chow hall. 
I had my 9-millimeter strapped to my side, walking in my uniform. And 
there were soldiers gathered along the streets on either side. I kind 
of peeked my head around, and then a Humvee drove by with the flag on 
it. And everybody was standing at perfect attention. I was asking 
somebody what that was. And they said, well, that was one of the 
soldiers who had recently been killed in action, and he is on his 
journey back to the United States.

I began to think about that soldier. Who were they? What branch of 
service were they in? How did they meet their fate? Did they know after 
C-130 pilots would fly in and unload them, cargo and troops on that 
very geographic spot, if they knew that they were going to fly home 
that way. And I remember that anonymous soldier because the mission 
that we have there is very important.



Whether we agree with this war or not, we have to understand that 
those troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan are there only because 
our country asked them to go. I believe that we do need to bring our 
troops home safely, honorably, and soon, but not yet. Discussion is 
good, but arbitrary deadlines are not. I am concerned about walking 
away from Afghanistan too prematurely. We must ensure some stability 
not only in Afghanistan, but also in Pakistan, because of their arsenal 
of nuclear weapons. It would be disastrous if we allowed some terrorist 
to get their hands on that arsenal of weapons.

So our policy in Afghanistan has a direct impact on the stability of 
our region. That is important to me, and we must continue our pursuit 
of those perpetrators of 9/11 in that region.

The gentleman I serve with from Ohio is a deeply honorable man, and 
he believes, as I do, that we need to bring our troops home safely, 
honorably, and soon. However, the only person that is in a position to 
judge the number of troops needed in Afghanistan, after considering the 
advice and counsel of the Secretary of Defense and the generals tasked 
with executing our strategy, in my opinion, is the President of the 
United States.

Congress's responsibility is to judge the President's strategy, 
making sure it meets our national defense goals, and provide him with 
the resources required for success. The war in Afghanistan is a top 
national security priority for our country. Having flown dozens of 
missions in and out of Bagram and Kandahar, I understand that success 
can only be achieved when the Afghan Government stands on its own and 
defends itself against any threats, whether those threats are physical, 
economic, or constitutional.
