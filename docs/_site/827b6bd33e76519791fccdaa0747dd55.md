Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator for yielding for a factual reference on 
the one point the Senator from Arizona raised, and I will reserve the 
remainder of my time for later on.

There is a waiver provision in this amendment that allows anyone who 
wants to return to duty in Iraq or Afghanistan to do so and without 
affecting the rights of other people to be deployed, according to the 
amendment.
