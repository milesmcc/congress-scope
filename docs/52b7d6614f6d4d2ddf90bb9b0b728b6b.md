Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, some of the most dangerous and 
lethal weapons our soldiers are facing in Iraq right now are there 
because Iran gave it to them. Osama bin Laden said: It is our religious 
duty to gain nuclear weapons.

If Iran is allowed to proliferate nuclear weapons into the hands of 
terrorists, any sense or concept of peace that we have experienced in 
this country so far could be gone in a blinding flash in the center of 
one of our major cities, maybe even in Washington, DC. And yet this 
majority has prevented us from voting on a military contingency plan to 
prevent Iran from gaining this deadly capability.

Mr. Chairman, very simply, the highway of history is littered with 
the dangers of strategic ambiguity, and I believe our best hope of 
preventing a nuclear Iran is to help them understand that we are 
prepared to do whatever is necessary, including a military contingency, 
if they continue to pursue their nuclear capability.



I hope that our children are not faced with the consequences of that 
strategic ambiguity. We need to be very, very clear. We need to vote on 
the amendment to improve this bill tomorrow.
