Mr. MURTHA. Let me just say that the Revolutionary War, my great-
great-grandfather fought in it. We fought our own war. In the Civil 
War, I have my great-grandfather's hat in my office. He fought against 
the South in the Civil War. We fought our own war. What we are trying 
to do in this legislation is force the Iraqis to fight their own war. 
That's what it's all about. Sixty-two Americans have died this month. 
We want to force the Iraqis to fight their own war.
