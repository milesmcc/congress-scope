`Mr. KING of Iowa â€” 8 September 2008`

---


Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, as I listen to the debate here and contemplate the 
global situation of 200,000, 300,000 child soldiers and


what that means, and the repatriation, so to speak, of the child 
soldiers in Afghanistan, having just returned from Iraq, Afghanistan, 
and Georgia, and having walked in some of the dust-covered mountains 
and in the dust-covered plains over there and been brought up to speed 
in briefings in both of those countries, it occurs to me how tough it 
is over in that part of the world, how close they are to the Stone Age, 
and how difficult it is to live in that country, let alone stand and 
fight, and the generations of warfare that have built one on top of the 
other. There is not a generation there that can remember not having 
fought.

Life expectancy in Afghanistan, 44 years. Up until a couple years 
ago, Afghanistan, by my recollection, was the only country in the world 
where men could expect to live longer than women, even though men were 
the ones that were most often killed in the conflict. The health care 
is that bad.

When young people are brought up in warfare and they are conscripted 
into the military and they are confronted with armed conflict at an 
early age, they may not know any other way of life. And to bring them 
back into education and try to repatriate them into more of, as we 
would see it, a normal lifestyle is a very difficult task. But Mr. 
Speaker, we must. We must break that cycle of violence. We must break 
that cycle of violence and the culture that reconstitutes at each 
generation. That is the case in Afghanistan, it is the case in Iraq, it 
is the case in the West Bank and in the Gaza strip and Israel proper. 
And it goes on and on and on around this world.

When little children, when little girls are raised to wear a pseudo 
suicide belt as part of perpetuating a culture of violence, when they 
are taught to hate people because of their religion or their ethnicity 
and they see that practiced on the news every day, when I turn on al-
Jazeera TV and I see the venom and the hatred that is there, when I 
watch the leaders of the people that oppose us bring it back home to be 
inspiring in recruiting people who believe that their path to salvation 
is killing people who are not like them, then I understand how 
important it is to break this cycle. I don't know if we are going to be 
able to do that. I think this bill will move us a little bit closer 
along that way. At least it stands on the right principle for the right 
cause, and I urge its adoption.

I yield back the balance of my time.
