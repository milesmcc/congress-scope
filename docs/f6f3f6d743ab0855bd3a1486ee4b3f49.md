`Mr. SESTAK â€” 15 December 2010`

Mr. SESTAK. When I arrived off Afghanistan in charge of an aircraft 
carrier battle group, I knew as an admiral that a certain percentage of 
that carrier battle group in combat was gay. I always wondered how one 
could come home and say they don't deserve equal rights.

I respect the differing opinion. It was 5,000 sailors on that 
aircraft carrier that I commanded. Their average age is 19/1/2/, and 
they just don't care. I honestly believe that when those who you are 
supposed to be leading are actually ahead of the leaders, leaders lose 
credibility.

I joined up during Vietnam. We were having race riots on our aircraft 
carriers then. We worked through that. That night off Afghanistan when 
I first arrived, we had never had women pilots. I put up one woman with 
seven men. She was the one that disobeyed


my orders and dove without permission and saved four Special Forces.

My point is we don't do this just for equality. We do it because we 
want the best of all, whether it is race, whether it is gender, or 
sexual orientation. That is why I support the repeal of Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell.
