Mr. SKELTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I find it rather interesting, Mr. Speaker, that those who oppose this 
simple, straightforward resolution tend to confuse a permissive war 
with a necessary war. The goals of the insurgents in Iraq are far 
different from the terrorists that had their genesis in Afghanistan. 
Let us not be confused between the two conflicts or their origins or 
those against whom we fight.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to a veteran of the Korean War, the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).

(Mr. CONYERS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
