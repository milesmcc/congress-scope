# HALL MONITORS

`Mr. POE â€” 15 July 2008`

---


Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Capitol Hill hall monitors have issued 
warning citations to Members of Congress. That's right; Republicans and 
Democrats all over the hill are getting busted. The dastardly offense 
was paying tribute to American warriors by placing a poster outside the 
office with photos of our troops killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. That's 
right. We're getting written up for honoring the memory of fallen 
soldiers from our home States and districts.

Here is my citation. I got busted for having a sign-in table and 
easel with a poster in the hallway. And this is the poster that I got 
written up for, Mr. Speaker. This letter says I have 30 days to comply 
with the new hallway policy or I will be in violation of this new 
edict.

You see, Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues and I choose to honor the 
men and women who have fought so bravely and given their lives in the 
current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we display a poster like this 
one.

This poster represents the 26 men and women of the Second 
Congressional District area of Texas that have been killed in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. We post these displays outside our offices so that we, our 
staff, and visitors will be constantly reminded of the sacrifice of our 
troops.

Our type of government exists because real Americans go to war and 
some of them don't come back. And these photos are of some, 26, of 
those Americans. Now the hall monitors want us to take them down. They 
say they are an ''obstacle.''

I will now read from the edict from the sign police that stealthily 
roam our hallways looking for violators of this hall monitoring 
proclamation. It says:

''In an emergency evacuation, the many items placed in the hallways 
of House office buildings interfere with the safe exit of Members, 
staff, and visitors . . . This policy was developed in response to a 
complaint regarding the proliferation of items placed in the hallways 
and responsive recommendation by the Office of Compliance. Its adoption 
was further recommended by the Committee on House Administration and 
supported by the Office of the Architect of the Capitol; the Office of 
Emergency Planning, Preparedness, and Operations; the House Sergeant at 
Arms; the Inspector General; the Chief Administrative Officer; and the 
Office of Compliance.'' And, Mr. Speaker, I will introduce this edict 
and this warning letter into the Record.
