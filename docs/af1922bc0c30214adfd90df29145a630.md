`Mr. BLUNT â€” 12 July 2007`

---


Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for that. Though that possibility is one 
that I'm surprised wasn't in the potential work for next week, though I 
hear that it's not in the scheduled work for next week, I'm wondering 
if we would see an Iraq bill next week or in the following week, will 
those bills go through committee, or will we just, once again, see 
those bills created and brought to the floor like the bill this week?

I would yield to my friend on that.
