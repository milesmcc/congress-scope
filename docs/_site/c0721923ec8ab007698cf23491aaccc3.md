Mr. DeFAZIO. Press reports today show that our trade deficit with 
China has jumped to $22.3 billion dollars--in 1 month.

Now President Obama wants to double down on Afghanistan with a 
counterterrorism strategy for $30 billion that many of us believe won't 
work. But that's because he's a war-fighting President.

This is a war with China, it's a trade war, and we have surrendered 
to China. Secretary Geithner pretends they aren't manipulating their 
currency. Our Special Trade Representative pretends they aren't 
precluding American products with unfair trade barriers. We never file 
complaints against their unfair trade barriers precluding our products 
from getting into their country.

We are losing the trade war with China. We're losing our national 
manufacturing base. We need those jobs. We can't keep borrowing money 
from China to buy things that we used to make in America. That's not a 
sustainable system.

Wake up downtown at the White House, please.
