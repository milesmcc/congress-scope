Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.

And I want to thank you and I want to thank Mr. DeFazio, both, for 
your work on this not only in this Congress, but your yeomen's work at 
the end of the last Congress to try to get this problem resolved. And I 
apologize for coming down late. I wanted to participate more fully, but 
the Rules Committee is meeting, as we are speaking, on the Iraq issue. 
So I was up there and didn't have a chance to come down.

But let me make a couple of points here. This really is about keeping 
a commitment that was made by the Federal Government to the counties. 
And you just made the point there that States with counties in the 
western part of the United States have a lot of Federal ownership. I 
have two counties that I just want to talk about in my district where 
over 80 percent of their land is owned by the Federal Government. Now, 
by definition that means that 80 percent of the taxable land that the 
county commission would have is not subject to taxation.

The decision was made over 100 years ago for these national 
forestlands, which is principally in my area. I know you have some 
development lands in yours. But since they don't have taxation, they 
said okay. Deals were worked out many years ago that you can have the 
revenue from harvesting the timber, which worked out very, very well. 
So that is the Federal policy that was made. The Federal Government 
owns the land in these counties; so, therefore, they can't tax it. It 
is Federal policy. In the early 1990s, another Federal policy or 
interpretation, I should probably say, of a Federal policy has led to a 
decline in timber receipts, as you can see here by the chart.
