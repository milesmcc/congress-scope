`Mr. GINGREY â€” 25 April 2007`

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, firmly and resolutely opposed 
to both this rule and the underlying conference report.

I regret to say that the Democratic leaders have once again 
demonstrated that it is either their way or the highway, except this 
time it is our fighting men and women who are left stranded in the 
middle of the road.

Mr. Speaker, I am truly saddened and, in truth, even angered by the 
majority's insistence on putting this war, our generals, and our war 
fighters on auto pilot with a forced retreat and an inflexible 
timetable.

The consequences of this decision, should it become law, will echo 
long beyond this date, this year, this decade. Defeat should not be an 
option, and yet it seems that this majority believes it is the only 
option.

We are at a critical juncture in history when the defenders of 
liberty and freedom have to stand firm against tyrants and terrorists.

And I will remind the gentleman from Virginia that just spoke, 
indeed, the famous quote says, ''There are times in our history when 
the tree of liberty must be nourished by the blood of patriots.''

Sure, without question, this war has been hard fought every step of 
the way, and it will continue to be. But few things worthwhile in life 
are ever easy.

Regrettably, this majority was bought and paid for by MoveOn.org and 
liberal extremists, and now they have come to collect, unfortunately, 
at the expense of our military and our security, today, tomorrow, and 
for decades to come.

When the Speaker of the House pushes to rewrite our foreign policy 
and yet refuses to meet with General Petraeus, our commander on the 
ground in Iraq, it becomes abundantly clear this majority would rather 
push left-wing politics over sound policy.

This political theater would be funny if its consequences weren't a 
matter of life and death, of victory and defeat. Every day that we 
delay a legitimate war-funding bill, the resources of our military and 
our soldiers' quality of life are diminished. In fact, this delay has 
forced the Pentagon to move $800 million from the Air Force's personnel 
accounts, money to pay our servicemembers, to make up for the gaps in 
the war funding.

I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, oppose this rule, 
oppose this conference report. Let us end this political game and truly 
give victory a chance.

We can do better, Mr. Speaker. We have an obligation to do better for 
the sake of the men and women who put their lives on the line in Iraq 
and Afghanistan to protect ours.
