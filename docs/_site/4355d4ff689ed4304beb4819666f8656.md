Mr. KUCINICH. The great amount of borrowing this country is doing 
from nations like China, Japan and Korea is weakening our dollar. Many 
of us know that we're borrowing money from China to prosecute a war in 
Iraq.

So with a weakened dollar, we're seeing a contribution here to the 
increased cost of crude oil. The weaker the dollar, the higher the 
price of crude oil. Today, the price of crude oil is about $130 a 
barrel. We're looking at gasoline this summer perhaps as much as $5 a 
gallon.

We need to change our economic direction. We need to strengthen our 
dollar. We need to change our monetary policy and stop borrowing. We 
need to go after these oil companies, not only in international courts 
with antitrust action, but we need a windfall profits tax. And if that 
fails, we need to have an honest discussion in this country about why 
we let the oil companies control the economy anyway.

Why don't we start looking at ways to take back the power of the 
people so that we can have control of our own destiny?
