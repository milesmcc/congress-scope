Mr. ADLER of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young 
man from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Lance Corporal Jeremy M. Kane, 22 
years old, was killed in Afghanistan on January 23, 2010 when a suicide 
bomber attacked his unit in the Helmand Province. Jeremy joined the 
Marines with his entire life before him. He chose to risk everything to 
fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land 
halfway around the world. Today, I join Jeremy's family, his friends, 
and the entire Cherry Hill community in mourning his death. While we 
struggle to bear our sorrow over his death, we can also take pride in 
the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. 
It is this courage and strength of character that people will remember 
when they think of Jeremy.

After graduating from Cherry Hill High School East in 2006, Jeremy 
attended Rutgers University to study criminal justice. He joined the 
Marine Corps on September 11, 2006, during his freshman year at Rutgers 
University and served as a reservist. His father, Bruce, had served as 
a major in the Army and passed away in June 2008 while Jeremy was 
undergoing Marine Corps training. His mother, Melinda, said Jeremy 
believed it was ''his duty to serve his country.'' Jeremy also leaves 
behind his two brothers, Benjamin and Daniel.

In recognition of this selfless individual and brave patriot who gave 
his life to protect this nation, I ask that the House of 
Representatives and all Americans join me to honor the legacy of Lance 
Corporal Jeremy M. Kane.
