Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to encourage my colleagues 
to support the troops in harm's way. We are fighting an ongoing war on 
terror not just in Iraq, but around the globe, and it is immoral for 
Members of this body to defund troops that are in harm's way.

That is why I commend my colleague Sam Johnson for stepping forward, 
for a resolution saying that we are not going to defund troops in 
harm's way, that we are going to stand beside them and fight with them 
in this war on terrorism and this war in Iraq, because, after all, 
terror is merely a tactic that Islamic extremists are using to fight 
the West.

As one of the last great powers in this world, we are the embodiment 
of the West. Therefore the Islamic extremists are seeking to destroy 
and undermine our society. So now more than ever we have to stand with 
our troops in harm's way so that they can defend us and make it 
possible for us to live in a vibrant, free Nation and a great economy.
