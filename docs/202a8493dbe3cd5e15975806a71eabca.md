# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `202a8493dbe3cd5e15975806a71eabca`
`Mr. DENT â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. DENT. And our very fine commander, David Petraeus, I met with him 
in Florida a few months ago. He said, on January 25, ''It was in 
Kandahar that 9/11 attacks were planned. It was in training camps in 
eastern Afghanistan where the initial preparation of the attackers was 
carried out before they went to Hamburg and flight schools in the U.S. 
It is important to recall the seriousness of the mission and why it is 
that we are in Afghanistan in the first place and why we are still 
there after years and years of hard work and sacrifice that have 
passed.''

Again, I strongly urge that we defeat this resolution. We owe it to 
our troops. They are watching this debate as we speak. They want us to 
oppose it too.
