Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I am pleased to bring to the floor a bipartisan bill authored by 
Congressman Salazar of Colorado with Congressman Lamborn of Colorado. 
It establishes a veterans cemetery in El Paso County, Colorado.

Southern Colorado, which includes El Paso, Colorado, and the city of 
Colorado Springs, has the second highest concentration of veterans 
living in the United States. Currently those veterans and their 
families who wish either to visit a veterans cemetery or have their 
loved ones interred must travel into the Denver metropolitan area to 
Fort Logan National Cemetery.

Not only is this an undue burden, but the Fort Logan cemetery is 
running out of room. To alleviate this problem, H.R. 1660 directs the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery for 
veterans in El Paso County, Colorado. This was a fitting tribute to 
those Americans who have served our Nation with honor. The veterans 
national cemeteries of the United States demonstrate the desire of a 
grateful Nation to appropriately commemorate those who have served in 
the Armed Forces.

Since 1862, close to 3 million burials have been made in the VA 
national cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs manages 125 of these cemeteries 
nationwide for our veterans. Of these, 58 of them are no longer 
accepting interments. Thus, the


need to build new cemeteries is quite urgent.

As we lose more and more of our greatest generation of veterans and 
face the increasing prospects of additional fatalities of Iraq, this 
country, at the very least, needs to ensure that veterans are provided 
a dignified, accessible and well-maintained final resting spot. This 
bill would go a long way in making that happen.

It is supported by the Military Order of the Purple Heart, American 
Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans and 
Paralyzed Veterans of America.

I was proud to see the bipartisan approach taken by two members of 
our committee, Mr. Salazar and Mr. Lamborn, to make sure that this bill 
got through the committee. They both worked cooperatively and 
tirelessly to get this bill to the floor today.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
