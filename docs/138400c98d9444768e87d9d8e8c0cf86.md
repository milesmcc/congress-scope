Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, last week President 
Nambaryn Enkhbayar of Mongolia visited the United States to meet with 
President Bush and discuss the growing partnership between our two 
nations. As cochair of the Mongolian Caucus, I was grateful for 
President Enkhbayar's visit. Mongolia and the United States continue to 
work closely together to strengthen our economic and strategic 
alliances, as well as our efforts internationally.

Madam Speaker, I am particularly appreciative of the Mongolian 
people's continued support of our efforts in Iraq as the central front 
in the global war on terrorism. During the visit, President Bush and 
President Enkhbayar signed a Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact. 
A millennium challenge compact is an initiative by the United States to 
help developing nations expand their economic growth by investing in 
infrastructure, health care, education, transportation and other areas.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.

Happy birthday, Alan Stedman of Haddenfield, New Jersey.
