Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. We did get part way into one of the 
pending amendments, and that is the amendment of Senator McConnell. I 
wish we had gotten one paragraph further and that is the National 
Intelligence Estimate, its conclusions. As a matter of fact, I 
understand another updated intelligence estimate is soon going to be 
received by the Congress and the American public. The National 
Intelligence Estimate states:




 Al-Qaida would attempt to use Anbar province to plan 


 further attacks outside of Iraq;



 Neighboring countries would consider actively intervening 


 in Iraq; and



 Sectarian violence would significantly increase in Iraq 


 accompanied by massive civilian casualties and displacement.


That is my concern with the Levin amendment. If we go in and announce 
with concrete law as to what our tactics should be, and we have this 
fixed timetable, with all due respect to my friend, I cannot support 
that.

I thank my colleague.
