`Mr. LEVIN â€” 18 December 2007`

---


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our amendment expresses the sense of the 
Congress that we should have a goal for the removal of most of our 
forces in a reasonable time mainly as a way of telling the Iraqi 
leaders they must accept responsibility for their own future. Our 
amendment expresses the sense of the Congress. It is not legally 
binding, but it puts us on record, and it sends a message. It says it 
is the sense of the Congress that:




 The United States Armed Forces in Iraq should transition to 


 the more limited set of missions laid out by President Bush 


 in his September 13, 2007, address to the Nation--


 counterterrorism operations and training, equipping, and 


 supporting Iraqi forces--


And we add--



 in addition to the necessary mission of force protection, 


 with the goal of completing that transition by the end of 


 2008.


The primary aim of this amendment is to keep the pressure on the 
Iraqi politicians to do what only they can do: Work out compromises, as 
they promised to do long ago--to compromise the differences which 
divide them so as to ensure the currently relatively calm situation in 
many parts of Iraq, including Baghdad, remains calm. Our sense of 
Congress language is aimed at pressuring the Iraqi politicians to seize 
the window of opportunity, as General Odierno put it, to avoid a return 
to the violence that characterized the presurge period.

The New York Times, in a story on December 5, quoted Iraqi Deputy 
Prime Minister Chalabi as saying about the present situation in Iraq: 
''It is more a cease-fire than a peace.'' Well, we need to make it 
clear to those Iraqi political leaders that a cease-fire is not good 
enough. They must take the steps to turn that cease-fire into a real 
peace.

From all accounts, the surge has already produced some military 
progress. The problem is that while the surge has, up to this point, 
achieved some military progress, it has not accomplished its primary 
purpose, as announced by President Bush last January. President Bush 
said the surge's purpose was to give the Iraqi Government ''the 
breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas'' and 
that ''reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make reconciliation 
possible.''


The President also said ''America will hold the Iraqi government to 
the benchmarks that it has announced.'' Well, the administration has 
not done what it said it would do--hold the Iraqi Government to the 
benchmarks that it, the Iraqi Government, has announced. Those 
legislative benchmarks include approving a hydrocarbon law, approving a 
debaathification law, completing the work of a constitutional review 
committee, and holding provincial elections. Those commitments, made 
1/1/2/ years ago, which were to have been completed by January of 2007, 
have not yet been kept by the Iraqi political leaders despite the 
breathing space the surge has provided.


Despite the breathing space the brave men and women wearing our 
uniform have provided the Iraqi leaders, despite the breathing room and 
the breathing space which young men and women putting their lives in 
harm's way on behalf of this Nation to give the Iraqis an opportunity 
to create a nation, they have not used that breathing space. And as a 
matter of fact, the Iraqi leaders appear to be farther apart today than 
they were at the start of the surge.

The Iraqi political leadership's response to the breathing space 
provided by the surge has been stunning inaction. The Iraqi Parliament 
has suspended its session until the New Year, thus ensuring that not 
1--not 1--of the 18 legislative benchmarks that they committed to meet 
will be met this year. The President's statement that he will hold the 
Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced is hollow 
rhetoric. To date, there have been no consequences for Iraqis' failures 
to meet those benchmarks.


Whether the Iraqi political leaders decide to take advantage of this 
window of opportunity is, of course, their decision. The United States 
cannot make that decision for them. They are a sovereign country and 
have to decide what is best for themselves. But whether the United 
States keeps an open-ended commitment or establishes a goal for 
redeployment of most of our forces is our decision. That is not the 
Iraqis' decision. They can decide whether to live up to the commitments 
they made to themselves and to us--solemn commitments, as far as I am 
concerned, because it involves the lives of American troops. Those 
solemn commitments have not been kept. We cannot force them to keep 
them, but we can decide whether we are going to maintain an open-ended 
commitment of our troops.

Mr. President, how much time do we have?
