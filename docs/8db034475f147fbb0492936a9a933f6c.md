`Mr. WESTMORELAND â€” 17 December 2007`

Mr. WESTMORELAND. I don't know how your constituents are going to 
feel about that, but when I go home and tell my constituents that we 
increased the IRS spending more than the normal 4 percent, or whatever 
it is, we have increased it double, and yet we didn't want to give any 
money to our troops in Iraq, they're going to be kind of mad about 
that. But then when I tell them they put up roadblocks about building 
the fence and we didn't fund our troops in Iraq, they're going to be 
upset about that. And then when I tell them about the $10 million in 
emergency spending for defense attorneys, I think they are really going 
to be mad about that.

I hope the American people get a good grip on this.
