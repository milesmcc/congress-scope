Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Dallas/
Fort Worth International Airport for their role in sponsoring the 
internationally recognized ''Welcome Home a Hero'' program. DFW has 
been selected by the U.S. Military to host the celebration of the 
success of this critical program for soldiers and their families.

DFW's ''Welcome a Hero'' program has been praised as the premiere 
volunteer homecoming program for soldiers returning from Iraq, 
Afghanistan and Kuwait for much needed R&R with their families.

On June 12, 2007, the 500,000th soldier to return home during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom for 2 weeks of Rest and Recuperation (R&R) will 
travel through DFW International Airport.

As a representative of part of the DFW Airport and a frequent 
traveler between DFW and Washington Reagan, I am grateful that they 
have taken to heart the mission of our brave soldiers. I have 
participated in the ''Welcome Home a Hero'' program, and I will always 
remember the pride I felt and the thankfulness I had for the dedication 
of those men and women to our country and freedom.

I extend my sincere congratulations the Dallas/Fort Worth 
International Airport and their success with the ''Welcome Home a 
Hero'' program.
