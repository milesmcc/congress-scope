# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `69d4393d1147de844a2fe23c30e0ce53`
`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 13 February 2007`

---


Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, as we debate this nonbinding resolution 
on Iraq, the administration is preparing for the next war in Iran. We 
are losing our democracy to war, massive debt, fear and fraud. The 
American people need Congress to surge towards the Constitution, surge 
towards the truth.

Now, some call this resolution a first step. I would like to believe 
that Congress will respond to the will of the American people expressed 
in the November election. They expect us to take real action to assert 
our constitutional power, to take America out of Iraq by refusing to 
provide any more funding for the war. That is our right. That is our 
duty. We have a duty to restrain an administration which is conducting 
an illegal war. We have a duty to hold to a constitutional accounting a 
President and a Vice President who led us into a war based on lies.

I led the effort against the Iraq war resolution.

Madam Speaker, I ask to include into the Record an analysis of the 
President's war resolution which was given to Members of Congress back 
in October of 2002. It pointed out that there is no proof that Iraq had 
weapons of mass destruction, anything to do with 9/11, anything to do 
with al Qaeda's role in 9/11. It is not as if Congress had no idea the 
war was based on untruths.

Now we must tell the truth, not just about the escalation, but about 
the occupation. We are illegally occupying Iraq. We attacked a nation 
which did not attack us. We must recognize the wrong that has been done 
and move to right it.

Instead of debating the end of the war, Congress is ironically 
preparing to give the war a new beginning. Some have made it clear long 
before this particular resolution that they will continue to fund the 
war by approving the upcoming supplemental appropriation, even though 
money exists to bring the troops home now.

When we equate funding the war with supporting the troops, we are 
dooming thousands of young Americans who are valiantly following the 
orders of their Commander in Chief. If we truly cared about the troops, 
we would not leave them in the middle of a civil war. If we truly cared 
about the troops, we would not leave them in a conflict for which there 
is no military solution.

The war is binding. The resolution is not. This resolution will not 
end the war. It will not bring our beloved troops home. It will not 
even stop the administration from sending more troops. That is because 
this resolution is nonbinding.

The war is binding. The resolution is not; 3,100 U.S. troops are 
bound in death; 650,000 innocent Iraqi civilians are bound in death.

The war is binding. The resolution is not. American taxpayers are 
bound in debt. The war could cost $2 trillion. We are borrowing money 
from Beijing to fight a war in Baghdad. Worse, each and every time 
Congress votes to fund the war, it votes to reauthorize the war. There 
were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but there are weapons of 
mass destruction at home. Poverty is a weapon of mass disruption. Lack 
of education is a weapon of mass destruction. Poor health care is a 
weapon of mass destruction. We must find and disarm those weapons of 
mass destruction which threaten the security of our own Nation. But 
Congress must first take responsibility.

The Federal Court has made it abundantly clear that once a war is 
well underway, Congress' real power is to cut off funds. Funding the 
war is approval of the war.

The American people are waiting for us to provide real leadership to 
show the way out of Iraq. My 12-point plan responds to that demand. 
This plan, drafted with the help of experts in international 
peacekeeping, specialists with U.N. experience and veteran military 
advisors, creates a peace process which will enable our troops to come 
home and stabilize Iraq.

Here are the elements of the Kucinich plan.

First, Congress must deny any more funds for the war.

Second, the President will have to call the troops home, close the 
bases and end the occupation.

Third, a parallel peace process which brings in international 
peacekeepers must begin. That is third.

Fourth, move in the international peacekeeping and security force and 
move out U.S. troops. Peacekeepers will stay until the Iraqis are able 
to handle their own security.

Fifth, order U.S. contractors out of Iraq.

Sixth, fund an honest process of reconstruction.

Seventh, protect the economic position of the Iraqi people by 
stabilizing


prices in Iraq, including those for food and energy.

Eighth, create a process which gives the Iraqi people control over 
their economic destiny without the structural adjustment policies of 
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Ninth, give the Iraqi people full control over their oil assets, with 
no mandatory privatization.

Tenth, fund a process of reconciliation between the Sunnis, Shiites 
and Kurds.

Eleventh, the U.S. must refrain from any more covert operations in 
Iraq.

And twelfth, the U.S. must begin a process of truth and 
reconciliation between our Nation and the people of Iraq.

There is a way out. Congress should stand for that. And we will have 
an opportunity to do it once again in about 6 weeks










Analysis of Joint Resolution on Iraq













(By Dennis J. Kucinich)




 Whereas in 1990 in response to Iraq's war of aggression 


 against and illegal occupation of Kuwait, the United States 


 forged a coalition of nations to liberate Kuwait and its 


 people in order to defend the national security of the United 


 States and enforce United Nations Security Council 


 resolutions relating to Iraq;



 Key Issue: In the Persian Gulf war there was an 


 international coalition. World support was for protecting 


 Kuwait. There is no world support for invading Iraq.



 Whereas after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, Iraq 


 entered into a United Nations sponsored cease-fire agreement 


 pursuant to which Iraq unequivocally agreed, among other 


 things, to eliminate its nuclear, biological, and chemical 


 weapons programs and the means to deliver and develop them, 


 and to end its support for international terrorism;



 Whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors, 


 United States intelligence agencies, and Iraqi defectors led 


 to the discovery that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical 


 weapons and a large scale biological weapons program, and 


 that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program 


 that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than 


 intelligence reporting had previously indicated;



 Key Issue: UN inspection teams identified and destroyed 


 nearly all such weapons. A lead inspector, Scott Ritter, said 


 that he believes that nearly all other weapons not found were 


 destroyed in the Gulf War. Furthermore, according to a 


 published report in the Washington Post, the Central 


 Intelligence Agency has no up to date accurate report on 


 Iraq's WMD capabilities.



 Whereas Iraq, in direct and flagrant violation of the 


 cease-fire, attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons 


 inspectors to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass 


 destruction stockpiles and development capabilities, which 


 finally resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from Iraq on 


 October 31, 1998;



 Key Issues: Iraqi deceptions always failed. The inspectors 


 always figured out what Iraq was doing. It was the United 


 States that withdrew from the inspections in 1998. And the 


 United States then launched a cruise missile attack against 


 Iraq 48 hours after the inspectors left. In advance of a 


 military strike, the U.S. continues to thwart (the 


 Administration's word) weapons inspections.



 Whereas in 1998 Congress concluded that Iraq's continuing 


 weapons of mass destruction programs threatened vital United 


 States interests and international peace and security, 


 declared Iraq to be in ''material and unacceptable breach of 


 its international obligations'' and urged the President ''to 


 take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution 


 and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into 


 compliance with its international obligations'' (Public Law 


 105-235);



 Whereas Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national 


 security of the United States and international peace and 


 security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material 


 and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, 


 among other things, continuing to possess and develop a 


 significant chemical and biological weapons capability, 


 actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, and supporting 


 and harboring terrorist organizations;



 Key Issues: There is no proof that Iraq represents an 


 imminent or immediate threat to the United States. A 


 ''continuing'' threat does not constitute a sufficient cause 


 for war. The Administration has refused to provide the 


 Congress with credible intelligence that proves that Iraq is 


 a serious threat to the United States and is continuing to 


 possess and develop chemical and biological and nuclear 


 weapons. Furthermore there is no credible intelligence 


 connecting Iraq to Al Qaida and 9/11.



 Whereas Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the 


 United Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in 


 brutal repression of its civilian population thereby 


 threatening international peace and security in the region, 


 by refusing to release, repatriate, or account for non-Iraqi 


 citizens wrongfully detained by Iraq, including an American 


 serviceman, and by failing to return property wrongfully 


 seized by Iraq from Kuwait;



 Key Issue: This language is so broad that it would allow 


 the President to order an attack against Iraq even when there 


 is no material threat to the United States. Since this 


 resolution authorizes the use of force for all Iraq related 


 violations of the UN Security Council directives, and since 


 the resolution cites Iraq's imprisonment of non-Iraqi 


 prisoners, this resolution would authorize the President to 


 attack Iraq in order to liberate Kuwaiti citizens who may or 


 may not be in Iraqi prisons, even if Iraq met compliance with 


 all requests to destroy any weapons of mass destruction. 


 Though in 2002 at the Arab Summit, Iraq and Kuwait agreed to 


 bilateral negotiations to work out all claims relating 


 to stolen property and prisoners of war. This use-of-force 


 resolution enables the President to commit U.S. troops to 


 recover Kuwaiti property.



 Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its 


 capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction 


 against other nations and its own people;



 Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its 


 continuing hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the 


 United States, including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate 


 former President Bush and by firing on many thousands of 


 occasions on United States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged 


 in enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations Security 


 Council;



 Key Issue: The Iraqi regime has never attacked nor does it 


 have the capability to attack the United States. The ''no 


 fly'' zone was not the result of a UN Security Council 


 directive. It was illegally imposed by the United States, 


 Great Britain and France and is not specifically sanctioned 


 by any Security Council resolution.



 Whereas members of al Qaida, an organization bearing 


 responsibility for attacks on the United States, its 


 citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred 


 on September 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq;



 Key Issue: There is no credible intelligence that connects 


 Iraq to the events of 9/11 or to participation in those 


 events by assisting Al Qaida.



 Whereas Iraq continues to aid and harbor other 


 international terrorist organizations, including 


 organizations that threaten the lives and safety of American 


 citizens;



 Key Issue: Any connection between Iraq support of terrorist 


 groups in Middle East, is an argument for focusing great 


 resources on resolving the conflict between Israel and the 


 Palestinians. It is not sufficient reason for the U.S. to 


 launch a unilateral preemptive strike against Iraq.



 Whereas the attacks on the United States of September 11, 


 2001 underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the 


 acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by international 


 terrorist organizations;



 Key Issue: There is no connection between Iraq and the 


 events of 9/11.



 Whereas Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to 


 use weapons of mass destruction, the risk that the current 


 Iraqi regime will either employ those weapons to launch a 


 surprise attack against the United States or its Armed Forces 


 or provide them to international terrorists who would do so, 


 and the extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the 


 United States and its citizens from such an attack, combine 


 to justify action by the United States to defend itself;



 Key Issue: There is no credible evidence that Iraq 


 possesses weapons of mass destruction. If Iraq has 


 successfully concealed the production of such weapons since 


 1998, there is no credible evidence that Iraq has the 


 capability to reach the United States with such weapons. In 


 the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq had a demonstrated capability of 


 biological and chemical weapons, but did not have the 


 willingness to use them against the United States Armed 


 Forces. Congress has not been provided with any credible 


 information which proves that Iraq has provided international 


 terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.



 Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 


 authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce United 


 Nations Security Council Resolution 660 and subsequent 


 relevant resolutions and to compel Iraq to cease certain 


 activities that threaten international peace and security, 


 including the development of weapons of mass destruction and 


 refusal or obstruction of United Nations weapons inspections 


 in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 


 687, repression of its civilian population in violation of 


 United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, and 


 threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations in 


 Iraq in violation of United Nations Security Council 


 Resolution 949;



 Key Issue: The UN Charter forbids all member nations, 


 including the United States, from unilaterally enforcing UN 


 resolutions.



 Whereas Congress in the Authorization for Use of Military 


 Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has 


 authorized the President ''to use United States Armed Forces 


 pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 


 (1990) in order to achieve implementation of Security Council 


 Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, 


 and 677'';



 Key Issue: The UN Charter forbids all member nations, 


 including the United States, from unilaterally enforcing UN 


 resolutions with military force.



 Whereas in December 1991, Congress expressed its sense that 


 it ''supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the 


 goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 as 


 being consistent with the Authorization of Use of Military 


 Force Against Iraq




 Resolution (Public Law 102-1),'' that Iraq's repression of 


 its civilian population violates United Nations Security 


 Council Resolution 688 and ''constitutes a continuing threat 


 to the peace, security, and stability of the Persian Gulf 


 region,'' and that Congress, ''supports the use of all 


 necessary means to achieve the goals of United Nations 


 Security Council Resolution 688'';



 Key Issue: This clause demonstrates the proper chronology 


 of the international process, and contrasts the current march 


 to war. In 1991, the UN Security Council passed a resolution 


 asking for enforcement of its resolution. Member countries 


 authorized their troops to participate in a UN-led coalition 


 to enforce the UN resolutions. Now the President is asking 


 Congress to authorize a unilateral first strike before the UN 


 Security Council has asked its member states to enforce UN 


 resolutions.



 Whereas the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105-338) 


 expressed the sense of Congress that it should be the policy 


 of the United States to support efforts to remove from power 


 the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a 


 democratic government to replace that regime;



 Key Issue: This ''Sense of Congress'' resolution was not 


 binding. Furthermore, while Congress supported democratic 


 means of removing Saddam Hussein it clearly did not endorse 


 the use of force contemplated in this resolution, nor did it 


 endorse assassination as a policy.



 Whereas on September 12, 2002, President Bush committed the 


 United States to ''work with the United Nations Security 


 Council to meet our common challenge'' posed by Iraq and to 


 ''work for the necessary resolutions,'' while also making 


 clear that ''the Security Council resolutions will be 


 enforced, and the just demands of peace and security will be 


 met, or action will be unavoidable'';



 Whereas the United States is determined to prosecute the 


 war on terrorism and Iraq's ongoing support for international 


 terrorist groups combined with its development of weapons of 


 mass destruction in direct violation of its obligations under 


 the 1991 cease-fire and other United Nations Security Council 


 resolutions make clear that it is in the national security 


 interests of the United States and in furtherance of the war 


 on terrorism that all relevant United Nations Security 


 Council resolutions be enforced, including through the use of 


 force if necessary;



 Key Issue: Unilateral action against Iraq will cost the 


 United States the support of the world community, adversely 


 affecting the war on terrorism. No credible intelligence 


 exists which connects Iraq to the events of 9/11 or to those 


 terrorists who perpetrated 9/11. Under international law, the 


 United States does not have the authority to unilaterally 


 order military action to enforce U.N. Security Council 


 resolutions.



 Whereas Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously the 


 war on terrorism through the provision of authorities and 


 funding requested by the President to take the necessary 


 actions against international terrorists and terrorist 


 organizations, including those nations, organizations or 


 persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the 


 terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 or 


 harbored such persons or organizations;



 Key Issue: The Administration has not provided Congress 


 with any proof that Iraq is in any way connected to the 


 events of 9/11.



 Whereas the President and Congress are determined to 


 continue to take all appropriate actions against 


 international terrorists and terrorist organizations, 


 including those nations, organizations or persons who 


 planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks 


 that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such persons 


 or organizations;



 Key Issue: The Administration has not provided Congress 


 with any proof that Iraq is in any way connected to the 


 events of 9/11. Furthermore, there is no credible evidence 


 that Iraq has harbored those who were responsible for 


 planning, authorizing or committing the attacks of 9/11.



 Whereas the President has authority under the Constitution 


 to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of 


 international terrorism against the United States, as 


 Congress recognized in the joint resolution on Authorization 


 for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40); and



 Key Issue: This resolution was specific to 


 9/11. It was limited to a response to 9/11.



 Whereas it is in the national security of the United States 


 to restore international peace and security to the Persian 


 Gulf region;



 Key Issue: If by the ''national security interests'' of the 


 United States, the Administration means oil, it ought to 


 communicate such to the Congress. A unilateral attack on Iraq 


 by the United States will cause instability and chaos in the 


 region and sow the seeds of future conflicts all other the 


 world.



 Now, therefore, be it



 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 


 United States of America in Congress assembled,
