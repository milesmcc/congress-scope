Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman.

Madam Speaker, I noticed that the gentleman from Maryland, the 
majority leader, did not mention the budget or the Afghan-Iraq 
supplemental for next week's schedule. And I know that in our last 
week's colloquy the majority leader, the gentleman from Maryland, 
stated that he would consider these two items as soon as possible. So I 
would ask the gentleman if he has an update about floor consideration 
for either the budget resolution or the supplemental bill for 
Afghanistan and Iraq.
