# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008

Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Iraq provisions 
included in amendment No. 2 calling for the responsible redeployment of 
our troops to begin within 30 days. After voting against this war, I 
have supported the goal of responsibly redeploying our troops for over 
2 years.

And after President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki signed a 
''Declaration of Principles'' document outlining unprecedented security 
commitments and assurances to Iraq from the United States, I introduced 
the Iraq Strategic Agreement Review Act.

So today I want to voice my support for the provision that makes 
clear, as my bill does, that any security arrangement between the 
United States and Iraq will not be funded unless it comes in the form 
of a treaty or is specifically authorized by a law.

As we speak, the administration is negotiating a strategic framework 
agreement that goes well beyond a typical Status of Forces Agreement, 
essentially amounting to a treaty. It will need to be ratified by the 
Iraqi parliament, and it must be ratified by the United States Congress 
as well.

Mr. Speaker, this issue goes to the heart of our constitutional 
duties as a Congress and the power to declare war with which we have 
been entrusted as representatives.

I urge my colleagues to support this provision.
