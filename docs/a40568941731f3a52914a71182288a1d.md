Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, sadly, many people try to 
separate the current Iraq conflict from the attacks of September 11 and 
the Global War on Terrorism; it is impossible to do so. The attacks of 
September 11 were not isolated, random events. Al Qaeda has openly 
stated Iraq is the central front in the war on terror. And our enemy is 
highly intelligent, well financed and committed to the destruction of 
freedoms.

The concept that America's retreat in Iraq will bring an end to 
sectarian violence and terrorist activity in the region ignores 
history. Premature retreat will embolden the enemy and make us more 
vulnerable to attacks. Withdrawals from Beirut and Mogadishu led to the 
1993 World Trade Center attack, the 1998 embassy bombings across 
Africa, the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, and then September 11. Osama 
bin Laden has characterized the struggle in Iraq as the third world 
war. We ignore this claim at our peril, which threatens American 
families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
