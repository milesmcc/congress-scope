Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, southeast Texas is proud of the military men 
that it's produced, men such as United States Air Force Major Andrew 
Stone of Beaumont, Texas, who recently received the Distinguished 
Flying Cross with Valor for his heroics while fighting in Afghanistan. 
Thus far, there have only been a handful of recipients of this second 
highest military award from the Afghanistan and Iraqi wars.

On October 30, 2006, Major Stone answered a distress call from a 
Special Forces Unit that was on the ground and was trapped and taking 
heavy rocket and machine gun fire. Alone against this enemy, Major 
Stone attacked in his A-10 aircraft with a barrage of 30mm cannon fire. 
With no regard for his own safety, and while exposing himself to 
horrific enemy ground fire, Major Stone continued to perform cover over 
this trapped Special Forces Unit until they reached complete safety. He 
would not leave any of them behind. It was his selfless courage and 
bravery that enabled this U.S. troop patrol to escape.

And as we approach Veterans Day, we honor our relentless warriors 
like Major Stone. And it's with great pride that I recognize this son 
of Texas and congratulate him on receiving the Distinguished Flying 
Cross.

And that's just the way it is.
