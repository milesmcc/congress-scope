Mr. DREIER. Reclaiming my time, and I'd like my friend to continue 
because I'll yield to him in a moment, but for him to claim over the 
last 4 years that this administration has been indifferent to the 
problem of corruption is an outrage because the problem of corruption 
is something that has existed for years.

This administration and this Congress have been dedicated to rooting 
out corruption in Iraq. We've worked in a bipartisan way on it, and 
it's very tragic and I think a disservice to those who want to address 
the issue of corruption that we somehow are told that we only accept 
this resolution, that does not engage in providing all of the facts, 
that we somehow are tolerant of or supportive of a policy of 
corruption.

I'm happy to further yield.
