Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Shays has made a good case, and the Chair has made 
a good case for this. Without mentioning the groups, so we don't call 
any attention to them, we know the good work that they are doing. Mr. 
Shays lived with one of the groups for a period of time. You saw the 
schools they were building. So I am just concerned we are getting 
wrapped up into process that since nothing is in, we are not going to 
put things in.

This is something that would actually work and have success in Iraq 
from the civilian side. It would be a


great boost to have this in. So I strongly support the amendment.
