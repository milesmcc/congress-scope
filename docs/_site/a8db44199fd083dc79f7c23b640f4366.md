Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady for her 
leadership and also thank the author of this measure and simply point 
out that we have already passed this measure, and we did pass it on our 
defense bill last year.

Very simply, no American troops are permanently stationed in 
countries around the world by virtue of the fact that we station them 
with the permission of the host country. The idea that we are going to 
insist or enforce, or unilaterally lodge American troops in Iraq is not 
something that is contemplated by anybody.

I just say to the gentlelady that we may have a time in the future, 
and we have dozens and dozens of countries around the world which on a 
regular basis give us permission to move our troops across their land 
area. We may have a time in the future, for example, 5 or 10 years from 
now, when we have to have an early warning for a missile strike from 
Iran to Israel.

I know that the gentlelady wouldn't object to American forces going 
in and establishing an early warning station so that we can save the 
lives of people living in Tel Aviv from a strike similar to the Scud 
strike that Saddam Hussein launched in the early 1990s at Israel.

We may have a time when we have to project American forces for a 
contingency around the world, and when you do that, regardless of what 
country you are talking about of the dozens of countries that host us 
on a regular basis, you go through a protocol. You contact the country. 
You receive their official permission going through their government, 
and that describes the parameters of the American presence that will be 
there, how long it will be there, what the usage will be, whether it is 
an airfield or a radar station.

But there could be a time, should Iran develop weapons of mass 
destruction or continue on this path to develop weapons of mass 
destruction and at some point attack a neighbor or prepare to attack a 
neighbor, and it could well be in the interest of the United States, 
for example, to have early warning capability should Iran want to make 
a strike on a country like Israel when that request will be made. And 
hopefully it would be responded to affirmatively by the free nation of 
Iraq.

I support this legislation, and I will vote for it again, as I voted 
for it six times. But I would hope that Members would understand and 
realize that we use dozens and dozens of assets around the world which 
are all done permissively by the host nations.
