Mr. KUCINICH. Wikileaks released 92,000 previously secret documents, 
totaling 200,000 pages, any one of which could conceivably be a case 
for a congressional hearing, which demonstrate that Congress has not 
been given a true account of the war by either the military or by two 
administrations. It would be good if Congress had announced hearings 
once WikiLeaks documents came forward.

But what we've learned is this: our troops are being placed in mortal 
peril because of poor logistics, countless innocent civilians killed by 
mistake, an Afghanistan Government which is hopelessly corrupt, 
Pakistan intelligence collaborating with the Taliban against the U.S., 
the Pentagon understating the fire power of the insurgents, a top 
Pakistani general visiting a suicide bombing school monthly.

Will we go deeper in this war in Afghanistan despite an abundance of 
information that it's time to get out?

We need to make the decision now. Today, vote against the 
supplemental.
