Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment 
regarding military family leave. This committee and this body has, in 
the past, taken great steps to make sure that our military families, 
when they're deployed, they have and do qualify for the Military Family 
Leave Act. Unfortunately, there are some specifics of the military 
family--sorry, of the Family Leave Act--that leave out some of our 
military personnel when they are deployed because of the jobs that they 
have. They do not qualify for the existing Family Leave Act.

What this amendment does is it makes sure that all military 
personnel, even if they don't qualify for the Family and Medical Leave 
Act, will have the ability to take at least--I'm sorry, the spouses, 
children and parents of our military personnel, will have the ability 
to take at least 2 weeks of unpaid leave when a servicemember receives 
a notification or order to active duty in support of a contingency 
operation or is deployed in connection with such an operation.

One of the things that we've really struggled to deal with is the 
amount that we have asked of the members of the Guard and Reserve. They 
have been deployed far more since 9/11 than they ever were before, and 
that has a tremendous impact on their families.

Now, the Guard and Reserve has performed an unbelievable service to 
this country. Every time I travel abroad, go to Iraq and Afghanistan 
and meet members of the Guard and Reserve who are serving over there, I 
come away enormously impressed with their immense dedication and the 
job they're doing on our behalf. They continue to do it. They continue 
to sign up. Recruitment and retention are at all-time highs. They are 
absolutely committed to serving this country.

But they also need our help and support because members of the Guard 
and Reserve typically have families and jobs here at home, and that is 
disrupted every time they're called up and sent overseas. This is one 
small way that we can help them deal with that disruption, by making 
sure that their loved ones qualify for the Family Medical Leave Act.

This would be unpaid leave, but it would make sure that they have the 
time to help support their loved one who is being deployed.

I ask the body to support this amendment.

Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
