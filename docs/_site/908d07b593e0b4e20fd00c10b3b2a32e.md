# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `908d07b593e0b4e20fd00c10b3b2a32e`
`Mr. WALSH of New York â€” 15 February 2007`

---


Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this 
resolution formalizing this body's resolve to support and protect the 
men and women in the United States Armed Forces in Iraq and 
disapproving of President Bush's decision to deploy 20,000+ additional 
combat troops to Iraq.

Like the overwhelming majority of my colleagues in the House and 
Senate, in 2002 I voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq should 
the President deem such force necessary.



Since then, the men and women of our Armed Services have carried out 
their mission with great courage and bravery, and they successfully 
achieved every military objective we set forth.

They removed a tyrannical, oppressive dictator who brutally 
slaughtered his own people, including innocent women and children.

They rebuilt schools and replaced a crumbling infrastructure.

And they provided security for the Iraqi people to successfully 
conduct interim elections, to write a new constitution, and to 
democratically elect and install new national leadership.

The remaining objectives articulated at the outset--conflict 
resolution between Sunnis and Shiites and national peace and 
stabilization--can only be achieved for the Iraqis, by the Iraqis. 
Their success will take personal will and political compromise from all 
domestic parties involved.

Mr. Speaker, success in Iraq today requires a political solution, not 
a military one. Twenty thousand more armed American men and women on 
the ground in Iraq will not change the determination or alter the 
strategy of the warring factions and militants our troops now face.

The addition of more American forces will certainly not encourage the 
Iraqi Forces to take responsibility for their nation's security. This 
premise never became clearer than when GEN. John Abizaid told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, ''I believe that more American forces 
prevent the Iraqis from doing more and from taking more responsibility 
for their own future.''

He continued, ''I've met with every divisional commander--General 
Casey, the corps commander, General Dempsey--we all talked together. 
And I said, 'in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in more 
American troops now, does it add considerably to our ability to achieve 
success in Iraq?' And they all said no.''

Today's U.S. military role in Iraq should be to assist in support and 
training initiatives, not to lead the charge. We must remember that 
this democracy does not belong to us, but to the Iraqi people who are 
responsible for protecting and enhancing it.

If an increase of troops is needed to stabilize specific regions, 
those troops ought to be Iraqi troops. At last count there were 325,000 
trained, equipped and fielded Iraqi Security Forces. At some point in 
time, these Iraqi Forces have to lead security efforts.

What better time than now? What better opportunity could there be for 
the Iraqis to manifest their national pride and commitment to democracy 
by concrete actions? The Iraqis are ready and the U.S. needs to stop 
enabling their dependence.

Recently, the 174th Fighter Wing of the New York Air National Guard 
based in my hometown of Syracuse returned from a support tour in Iraq, 
and I'm proud that a young member of my staff deployed with them. 
Dozens of other young men and women from New York's 25th Congressional 
District have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am deeply proud of them 
and their remarkable service to our country.

Mr. Speaker, I stand before you as a member of the greatest 
deliberative body in the greatest representative democracy in the 
world. We are the people's House. We are all elected--chosen--every two 
years by citizens across this land to converge here in Washington to 
represent them, to vote on their behalf, and to ensure that their 
voices are heard in every national debate. And as Members of Congress 
we do so with a unique balance of personal belief and public will.

The President is the Commander in Chief. That is a fact. But he is 
not the sole decider. We--the other elected leaders of our government--
have a responsibility to express the will of the American people as we 
perceive it.

The people of my New York district overwhelmingly supported this 
mission at its start, as did I. We still support its goals. We will 
always support our troops. But we do not support the continued build up 
of U.S. troops in Iraq.

This resolution states the House's disagreement with the President on 
this strategy, and I support this 97-word resolution before us. But I 
also say today clearly and without equivocation that I will not support 
any proposal to cut funding to our troops while they are in harm's way.

America has kept her promises to the people of Iraq. Over 3,000 
American soldiers have given their lives to ensure those promises were 
kept, and their families now go forward with a constant reminder of the 
price of their sacrifice.

This resolution confronts the reality that there are defined military 
objectives, defined diplomatic objectives, and defined political 
objectives that can only be achieved by a sovereign and selfsustaining 
people.

This resolution, ultimately, is about the role and the responsibility 
of the Iraqi people. This resolution does not call for us to step out--
American troops there need to remain and take on a different role. 
Rather, this resolution calls for Iraq to step up.

For that reason, it has my support.
