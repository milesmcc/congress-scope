`Mr. LEAHY â€” 5 March 2009`

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is an unnecessary amendment. The 
Senator from Oklahoma asked an obvious question: Why is this language 
not in there? Nobody wanted it. No Republican asked for it. No Democrat 
asked for it. The Bush administration didn't ask for it. We constantly 
remove outdated, unnecessary language from these bills to clean them 
up.

The United Nations has no power to tax the United States or any 
person in the United States. It would be like saying we want to pass a 
law that says that if the U.N. were to launch several divisions of 
soldiers against us, we will cut off their funding. They can't do that 
any more than they can impose a tax against us. They are not a taxing 
organization.

So we deleted provisions like this that serve no purpose, and which 
no senator requested. It has no practical effect. The Bush 
administration didn't want it. No Republican asked for it. No Democrat 
asked for it. Let's focus on the real problems such as Darfur, the 
Middle East, and Afghanistan where we are asking United Nations 
peacekeepers and aid workers to risk their lives to support our goals.

I oppose this amendment.
