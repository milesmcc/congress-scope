# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `966932169b372de1b3152b0c2a2eb4ae`
`Mr. PENCE â€” 13 February 2007`

---


Mr. PENCE. I thank the ranking member for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the concurrent resolution 
for the House, and I do so from a position of a humble public servant, 
one who has not served in Iraq in uniform, as our previous speaker did, 
and others have who are in this Chamber at my side, but as one who has 
been there. I rise as one who is charged with public responsibility as 
the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee.

While this resolution before the Congress today and this week, while 
this resolution expresses support for our troops in Iraq, the heart of 
the resolution is a statement of disapproval of the President's so-
called surge of troops in Iraq, and I cannot support it.

I see Iraq, as others have eloquently stated, as the central front in 
the war on terror. I rise today in opposition to this resolution out of 
a fundamental sense that we have a moral obligation to finish what we 
started, to confront the enemies of our way of life, and to support our 
duly elected Commander in Chief as he makes those decisions that he 
deems necessary and appropriate to achieve those ends.

Let me say from the heart, for a moment, my reasons for supporting 
this troop surge. A few days before President Bush addressed the 
Nation, he invited a handful of Members of Congress down to the West 
Wing of the White House. I must tell you that I had my doubts about 
this troop surge. In all four of my trips to Iraq, I had heard 
consistently from our military commanders over the past several years 
that a large American footprint in Iraq was actually counterproductive 
to our goals.



But August and the aftermath of 2006 changed all of that. All of that 
advice predated an extraordinary increase in violence that commenced in 
the late summer of last year, when it became clear to all of us in this 
body, and to freedom-loving people around the world, that our strategy 
and tactics on the ground in Iraq were not working.

Now, I took that skepticism and that counsel into the Cabinet room of 
the West Wing, and there I heard the President describe a new strategy 
and new tactics. For all of the world to have read the newspaper 
accounts, Mr. Speaker, I would have assumed the President was simply 
sending more troops for more troops' sake. But that was not the case.

Despite what the previous speaker on this floor suggested, this is a 
new strategy. It is a new way forward. It is an effort on the part of 
the President to embrace an increase in troop strengths in Baghdad that 
was initially recommended by the Iraq Study Group, and more on that in 
a moment.

But let me say that I believe this new way forward, this new approach 
ought to be given a chance to work. I believe to oppose the President's 
new strategy in Iraq is to accept the status quo. And the headlines of 
the last 24 hours should tell every man and woman of good will in this 
Congress that the status quo in Iraq is not acceptable.

Now, earlier I mentioned that the approach of a troop surge in 
Baghdad was first recommended by the Iraq Study Group. I am quite 
struck, Mr. Speaker,


that the previous speaker who is a freshman Member of Congress from 
Pennsylvania spoke, as many have in the Democrat majority, quite 
glowingly of the report of the Iraq Study Group. And I admire this work 
product greatly.

A bipartisan work authorized during the last Congress, James A. 
Baker, III, former Secretary of State, Lee Hamilton of Indiana, a 
former chairman of the House International Relations Committee bringing 
together a bipartisan group of wise counselors developed the Iraq Study 
Group report.

While I do not agree with every aspect of it, particularly those that 
talk about having a dialogue with terrorist states in the region, there 
is much that recommends the American people to the Iraq Study Group. 
And again I site in evidence the gentleman from Pennsylvania's glowing 
reference to that report just moments ago.

Now, let's look, if we can, at what the Iraq Study Group has to say 
about the idea of a troop surge in Iraq. I would offer very humbly, and 
maybe startling to some who are looking in, Mr. Speaker, that the very 
words ''troop surge'' comes from the Iraq Study Group's 
recommendations.

Allow me to quote from page 73 of the book that is available in book 
stores all over America. The Iraq Study Group said: ''We could, 
however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat 
forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and equipping 
mission if the U.S. Commander in Iraq determines that such steps would 
be effective.''

Let me emphasize that again. The Iraq Study Group that the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania and many in the majority have heralded as an 
important work that provides us with a vision for going forward says: 
''We could, however, support a short-term redeployment of surge of 
American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad.''

Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what President Bush called for in 
January. And it is precisely that which Congress this week is poised to 
reject in a nonbinding resolution. I submit to you today that if the 
Iraq Study Group is to be cited again and again by the majority as 
source authority, and a fount of wisdom, and I believe it is, then 
let's be clear about the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group.

It is not to say, Mr. Speaker, that a short-term redeployment or 
surge of combat forces in Baghdad will solve the present crisis and 
impasse that we face. It simply is a strategy to quell violence with 
Iraqis in the lead, to create the conditions of stability whereby a 
long-term political solution can be achieved.

Now let me say, Mr. Speaker, it was my great hope that the resolution 
before us today would have come to the floor under procedural rules 
that allowed for amendments. For my part I spent much of last evening 
offering an amendment, along with others, that would state that it is 
the sense of Congress that we should not take any action that would 
result in the elimination or reduction of funds for our troops.

I rise today not to complain about procedure, but to say, Mr. 
Speaker, I regret that this newly minted majority could not do as the 
Democrat chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee appears 
prepared to act.

My amendment that was offered, similar to others, has nearly 
identical language to a resolution being offered by the distinguished 
Senator Levin, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. And both 
of us agree that Congress should affirmatively state that it will not 
cut funding to the troops.

I deeply regret that we were not able to make that declarative 
statement today. And let me say with great respect to the chairman of 
this Armed Services Committee, who needs not to hear from me about the 
deep respect I have for him, that I have to believe that somewhere in 
his heart of hearts, knowing his extraordinary record of service to 
this country, that he may well have hoped for a stronger statement as 
well.

While the Democrat resolution before us expresses the hope that 
Congress and all Americans will continue to support and protect our 
brave men and women serving in Iraq, it does not take the next step to 
show tangible support for our troops in the nature of funding. And let 
me say this with great sincerity: there is a fundamental difference 
between pledging to support and protect our troops and pledging not to 
cut off the funding for our war in Iraq.

It is a specious distinction, and one that is not lost on our 
colleagues in the Senate. I would submit to you that words have 
consequences, and ''support'' and ''protect'' do not assure the 
American people that we will continue to fund our troops in the field.

I believe the American people understand this point, Mr. Speaker. A 
poll cited this morning in USA Today shows that even though a majority 
of Americans are opposed to the surge of troops in Baghdad, a majority 
also oppose cutting off funding for the troops.

The American people do not want Congress to defund this war in the 
majority, even if they are concerned about the course and direction the 
war is taking. And Congress should tell the troops and the American 
people that it will never use the power of the purse to accomplish 
policy ends in the field of battle.

With this I close. Listening to this debate today and to the 
opposition to the surge being espoused by the Democrat majority, I have 
begun to wonder a very simple question: What if it works? I have made 
it clear that I support the surge and the President's new strategy.

My good friends on the Democrat side of the aisle and, as has been 
said, some Republicans have made it clear that they oppose the surge of 
forces in Iraq. And that is their right, and if it is in their heart, 
it is their duty. And at this moment, it appears that a majority of 
Americans are with the majority in this Congress.

But what if? What if they are wrong? What if you are wrong? What if 
the surge and the new leadership of General Petraeus and the courage 
and bravery of American men and women in uniform and the sacrifices of 
Iraqis in uniform succeed in the coming months?

You know, it is a snow day back in Indiana today, Mr. Speaker. And my 
kids are even home watching this on TV. I give my kids some pretty 
basic advice sometimes. One of the pieces of advice I give my kids when 
they are facing challenges, I say to them, you know, people don't like 
losers, but they like quitters even less.

And I think we ought to reflect on that old maxim as we come upon 
this decision today. If this new strategy in Iraq succeeds in the 
coming months, what will those who vote for this resolution say? The 
truth is, we must fight and win a victory for freedom in Iraq. The 
truth is we have no option but victory.

In their hearts the American people know this, and the American 
people are willing to make the hard choices to choose victory. Courage. 
Courage is the key in this moment.

C.S. Lewis wrote that courage is not simply one of the virtues, but 
the form of every virtue at the testing point. Courage then is the 
answer, not recrimination and retreat. We are at a moment when the 
American people and the Members of this body will take a stand. This is 
a moment for courage. Our brave men and women in Iraq exhibit courage 
and uncommon valor every day.

It is my hope and prayer that we in this House might follow their 
lead and show them that such courage resides here as well. Let's vote 
down this resolution and find it within ourselves to lead the American 
people by bringing forward the resources and the support necessary to 
see freedom within Iraq.
