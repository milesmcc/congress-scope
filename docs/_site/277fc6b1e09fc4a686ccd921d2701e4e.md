`Mr. DAVIS of Illinois â€” 29 March 2007`

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of 
the Progressive Caucus budget and I do so for a number of good reasons.

First off, all budgets are a way of assessing need and determining 
priorities and when one takes a serious look at the Progressive Caucus 
budget it:

(1) Projects complete U.S. military redeployment out of Iraq during 
2007, saving at least $187 billion dollars over the next 2 years.

(2) You should not spend money if you do not have it, therefore the 
Progressive Caucus budget repeals the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 
1 percent of taxpayers due to expire in 2010 saving at least $348 
billion dollars.

(3) It fully funds NCLB and IDEA and improves teacher corp and job 
training.

(4) It adequately funds Medicare and Medicaid so that more Americans 
can have access to affordable quality healthcare.

(5) This budget helps to rebuild America's communities by 
substantially increasing funding for community development block 
grants, community policing, and clean up of underground storage tanks.

Madam Chairman, this is a budget I can take home to any constituent 
and they will say, right on.
