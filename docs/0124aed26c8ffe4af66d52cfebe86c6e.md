Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Bruce Morgan, a man 
with immense scientific contributions and over 40 years of service to 
our nation at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Mr. Morgan graduated with an A.S. Degree in Gunsmithing from Trinidad 
State Jr. College in Trinidad, Colorado in May 1967. Mr. Morgan was 
then hired by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he was 
assigned to support the Linear Accelerator.

Mr. Morgan has made his presence in the workplace known. He has 
worked with nuclear reactors, designed and constructed experiments, and 
advanced previous findings in the field.

Mr. Morgan built the first 9-inch Rotating Neutron Source, which was 
a major accomplishment for his employer, the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, at the time. This invention allowed the study of 
neutron flux in nuclear weapons.

Mr. Morgan has also designed, fabricated, and developed many 
innovations in ballistic technology such as ballistic range hardware 
and gunload development, high-speed camera and flash x-ray systems to 
perform ballistics diagnostics, experiments in light armor using Cermet 
materials, experiments with explosive active and reactive armor, 
experiments resulting in the ultimate development of an upgraded armor 
package for the MI-M2 Abrams Tank, and development of light armor for 
the AC-130 Gunship for use by our military ground-support aircraft.

Mr. Morgan was also temporarily deployed to work on upgrading armor 
packages for the


Humvee and armored gun-truck in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

As Mr. Morgan retires from the work he has been involved in for over 
40 years, I would like to thank him for his great contributions and 
advancements in the field, and acknowledge the loyal service he has 
given to his employers and country. I wish him the best in all his 
future endeavors.
