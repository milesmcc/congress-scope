# DEFENSE REAUTHORIZATION BILL
## `884de3e9ef4e89592b1d3728dc83e81a`
`Mr. HOYER â€” 25 May 2010`

Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen, we will soon bring to the floor a 
defense authorization bill that invests in our most important security 
needs: disrupting terrorists networks, countering nuclear 
proliferation, strengthening international cooperation to defeat the 
Taliban, preparing the Iraqi Government to stand on its own, and 
investing in the needs of our troops and their families.

This bill builds on Democrats' strong defense record. Under President 
Obama, we have killed or captured some of the highest ranking leaders 
in al Qaeda--many more than we did under the last administration--and 
the Taliban; laid out a clear way forward in Afghanistan; disrupted 
terrorism with the full resources of our intelligence community and 
justice system; and increased funding for human intelligence 
collection, cybersecurity, and security for our skies, our ports, and 
our borders.

This bill offers us a chance to improve on the flawed record of the 
Bush administration, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
