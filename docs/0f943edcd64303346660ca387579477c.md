Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, when this Defense Authorization bill cleared 
the House last May it included an amendment which I authored requiring 
congressional approval of any agreement negotiated between the 
President and the Government of Iraq which commits the United States to 
the defense and security of Iraq from internal and external threats. 
But because the White House threatened to veto the bill over this 
prudent and reasonable provision, the version of the bill returned to 
us from the Senate no longer includes that limitation. That is reason 
alone to oppose this bill, which I do.

Although I cannot support the bill as amended, I want to thank my 
good friend Mr. Skelton, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, 
for strongly supporting the Lee amendment and for his valiant efforts 
to retain it during the negotiations with a stubborn an unreasonable 
White House.

An agreement to commit American troops to the defense and security of 
another country is not routine or typical or minor. It is a major 
commitment that must have the support of the American people. And that 
popular will can only be reflected by the Congress of the United 
States. That is why the Lee amendment was necessary. I regret we have 
lost a valuable opportunity to bring much needed accountability and 
transparency to our relationship with Iraq.
