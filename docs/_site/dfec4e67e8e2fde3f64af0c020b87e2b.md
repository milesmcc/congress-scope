Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, Congress has the power to end the war in 
Iraq simply by refusing to pass any legislation to continue to fund it. 
The money is in the pipeline there right now to bring the troops home.

H.R. 1234 provides a plan for bringing the troops home, ending the 
occupation and stabilizing Iraq. This war will never end if Congress 
advances administration plans to privatize Iraq's oil through insisting 
on the passage of a so-called hydrocarbon act by the Iraqi legislature.

Today I will be distributing to Members of Congress a detailed report 
that explains how the legislation that we are advancing moves to 
privatize Iraq's oil.
