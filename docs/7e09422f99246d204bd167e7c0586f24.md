`Mr. REID â€” 29 June 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of 
morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes 
each. There will be no votes today. The next votes are expected to 
occur Monday, around 5:30; that is July 9.

As I said yesterday, the Senate will vote on the remaining four 
judicial nominations that are on the Executive Calendar. Also, on 
Monday, July 9, the Senate will begin consideration of the Defense 
Department authorization bill, an extremely important bill for all of 
our military servicemembers in Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, and all 
over the world.

So when the Senate leaves today for the Fourth of July recess and 
returns on July 9, Members should expect a very busy legislative work 
period during the month of July.
