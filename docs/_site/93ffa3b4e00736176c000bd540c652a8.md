Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the RESTORE Act and to set the record straight on an issue 
that is close to my heart.

In May of 2007, three men from the 10th Mountain Division were 
captured in Iraq. They're names are Specialist Alex Jiminez, Private 
First Class Joseph Anzak, and Private Byron Fouty. I recite their names 
because the right wing attack machine never does. But these are the 
facts, and they're not pretty.

The intelligence community stood ready to help find these three 
soldiers. But for 5 hours, for 5 hours, the Bush administration could 
not decide what to do. When they decided to go ahead, no Bush 
administration official could authorize it, could be found to authorize 
it. But when they finally found the Attorney General in Texas, it took 
an additional 2 hours to authorize the surveillance, even though he 
could have granted the authority in just minutes. Hours of indecision 
and incompetence while these three soldiers went missing.

While the RESTORE Act can solve many problems posed by the current 
FISA law, it will not solve the problem in these soldiers' situations.
