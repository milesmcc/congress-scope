# UNITES STATES POLICY IN IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2007--S. J. RES. 9
## `bae5045bc891a4fc4ffd97d75b2ab1ce`
`Mr. KYL â€” 15 March 2007`

---


Mr. KYL. Madam President, the article points out the fact that the 
death squad deaths are falling substantially, the militia activity is 
down substantially. While our commanders there are being cautious about 
declaring the operation a success, nonetheless, there are many 
different descriptions of events happening in Iraq that give us a lot 
of hope.

I was there a couple of weeks ago, and our commanders and Iraqis both 
were cautiously optimistic this would work.

The point is, at the very time the new plan is underway and it seems 
to at least show early signs of success, why would we want to declare 
it a failure and start the process of withdrawing at the very time 
these additional troops seem to be making a difference?

One of the chairmen of the Baker-Hamilton study commission, former 
Democratic Congressman Lee Hamilton, was testifying before the Congress 
about a month ago. He said we should give this plan a chance. We should 
give it a chance to succeed. That is exactly what we ought to do. We 
start by rejecting the resolution that is pending because it 
micromanages the war and sends a horrible signal.

We also try to support the troops by adopting as quickly as possible 
a supplemental appropriations bill that funds this effort without tying 
the strings of our commanders and without imposing so many other 
conditions that the President is constrained to veto it. We have to get 
that funding to our troops as soon as possible. That is the other 
message the commanders on the ground, both in Kuwait and Iraq, gave to 
me when we were there. They said: Please adopt the supplemental 
appropriations bill without strings.

I urge my colleagues to vote against the resolution when it comes up 
for a vote later this afternoon.

 Baghdad's Terror Death Counts are Falling














(By Robert H. Reid)




 Baghdad.--Bomb deaths have gone down 30 percent in Baghdad 


 since the U.S.-led security crackdown began a month ago. 


 Execution-style slayings are down by nearly half.



 The once frequent sound of weapons has been reduced to 


 episodic, and downtown shoppers have returned to outdoor 


 markets, which are favored targets of car bombers.



 There are signs of progress in the campaign to restore 


 order in Iraq, starting with its capital city, according to a 


 Pentagon report released Wednesday.



 But although many Iraqis are encouraged, they remain 


 skeptical how long the relative calm will last. Each bombing 


 renews fears the horror is returning. Shiite militias and 


 Sunni insurgents are still around, perhaps just lying low or 


 hiding outside the city until the operation is over.



 U.S. military officials, burned before by overly optimistic 


 forecasts, have been cautious about declaring the operation a 


 success. Another reason it seems premature: Only two of the 


 five U.S. brigades earmarked for the mission are in the 


 streets, and the full complement of American reinforcements 


 is not due until late May.



 The report even used for the first time the term ''civil 


 war'' to describe some of the violence. But it stressed that 


 the term does not capture Iraq's complex situation, and its 


 assessment was based on the final three months of 2006, which 


 it said was the most violent three-month period since the 


 U.S.-led invasion.



 U.S. officials say the key to the security crackdown's 


 long-term success is the willingness of Iraq's sectarian and 


 ethnic political parties to strike a power- and money-sharing 


 deal. That remains elusive: A proposal for governing oil, the 


 country's main source of income, is bogged down in 


 parliamentary squabbling.



 Nevertheless, there are encouraging signs.



 Gone are the ''illegal checkpoints,'' where Shiite and 


 Sunni gunmen stopped cars and hauled away members of the 


 rival sect, often to a gruesome torture and death.



 The rattle of automatic-weapons fire or the rumble of 


 distant roadside bombs comes less frequently. Traffic is 


 beginning to return to the city's once-vacant streets.



 ''People are very optimistic because they sense a 


 development. The level of sectarian violence in streets and 


 areas has decreased,'' said a 50-year-old Shiite, who gave 


 his name only as Abu Abbas, or ''Father of Abbas.'' ''The 


 activities of the militias have also decreased. The car bombs 


 and the suicide attacks are the only things left while other 


 kinds of violence have decreased.''



 In the months before the security operation began Feb. 14, 


 police were finding dozens of bodies each day in the capital, 


 all victims of Sunni and Shiite death squads. Last December, 


 more than 200 bodies were found each week, with the figure 


 spiking above 300 in some weeks, according to police reports 


 compiled by the Associated Press.



 Since the crackdown began, weekly totals have dropped to 


 about 80, which is hardly an acceptable figure but clearly a 


 sign that death squads are no longer as active as they were 


 in the final months of last year.



 Bombings also have decreased in the city, presumably due to 


 U.S. and Iraqi success in finding weapons caches and to more 


 government checkpoints in the streets that make it tougher to 


 deliver the bombs.



 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, made a show of 


 confidence Tuesday by traveling out of Baghdad for meetings 


 with Sunni tribal leaders and government officials in Ramadi, 


 a stronghold for Sunni insurgents.



 ''I would caution everybody about patience, about 


 diligence,'' Maj. Gen. William Caldwell, a U.S. spokesman, 


 said Wednesday. ''This is going to take many months, not 


 weeks. But the indicators are all very positive right now.''



 Sunni militants, meanwhile, are believed to have withdrawn 


 to surrounding areas such as Diyala province, where they have 


 safe haven. The U.S. command sent an extra 700 soldiers 


 Tuesday to protect the highways leading into the capital from 


 there.



 If militants from both sects are indeed lying low, that 


 suggests they may have adopted a strategy of waiting until 


 the security operation is over, then re-emerging to fight 


 each other for control of the capital.
