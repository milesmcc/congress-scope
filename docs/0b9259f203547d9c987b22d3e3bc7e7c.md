`Mr. ELLISON â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, for weeks now, the Republican Senators have 
been coming forward saying that the status quo in Iraq cannot continue. 
They're right. This week they have an opportunity to act on those 
words. We'll see if they join us in changing the course of the war, or 
if they find another excuse as to why they must continue to support 
President Bush's failed policy. I would hope that they would stand by 
their words.

Senator Lugar correctly stated, ''The President and some of his 
advisers may be tempted to pursue the surge strategy to the end of his 
administration, but such a course contains extreme risks for United 
States national security.'' Senator Voinovich correctly stated, ''A 
policy of responsive military disengagement, with a corresponding 
increase in nonmilitary support, is the best way to advance our 
Nation's interests in Iraq and achieve our primary goals.'' Senator 
Domenici again correctly stated, ''There's nothing to wait for.''

We agree. That's why this House voted last week to bring most of our 
troops home by next April. The Senate has the chance to take that same 
action this week. I hope that these Senators will stand by their words 
and join us in changing the course.
