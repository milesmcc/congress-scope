Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, all of the photo ops and the doctored 
statistics in the world will not change the fundamental fact that there 
is no military solution to the civil war in Iraq. Instead of facing 
reality, the President is asking for another blank check for his failed 
policy, and Congress should not give it to him.

We must decide whose interests we represent, a President who has 
staked his legacy on an unnecessary war, or the millions of Americans 
that understand that ending the occupation is the first step in 
repairing the damage that this administration has done to the security 
of our Nation and the world.

Congress has the power really to end this failed policy. We should 
not approve another penny to continue that policy. Instead, we should 
use our constitutionally mandated appropriations power to fully fund 
the safe, timely and responsible redeployment of our troops and 
contractors from Iraq.

When we say we support our troops, let's mean it by bringing them 
home.
