Mr. STARK. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the Defense 
Appropriations bill. As families and businesses struggle in this 
recession, this bill spends money on the wrong priorities for our 
Nation and the world.

The legislation provides $128.3 billion to fund wars in Afghanistan 
and Iraq that never should have been waged, as well as $9.3 billion for 
missile defense funding that doesn't work. According to the Washington 
Post, over $6.9 billion in funding is for new ships, planes, 
helicopters and armored vehicles that the Pentagon doesn't want.

We are wasting money on these projects as defense eats up a larger 
share of our budget--58 percent of all discretionary spending, up from 
51 percent four years ago.

This giveaway to defense contractors comes at the same time that 
Members of Congress are balking at health care reform that will cost a 
fraction of our defense spending over the same time period. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in voting no.
