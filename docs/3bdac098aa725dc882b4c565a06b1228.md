Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today we are voting yet 
again on legislation that will provide approximately $165 billion in 
funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the bill 
does not include the necessary language that I and many of my 
colleagues support to ensure that this war funding is not simply a 
blank check. I cannot vote for legislation to fund the administration's 
wrongheaded policies in Iraq without provisions that ensure that 
American troops will be coming home by a date certain.

However, I will support the amendment that will provide critical 
funding for domestic priorities. This amendment will expand veterans' 
education benefits and extend unemployment insurance by 13 weeks for 
all States. Additionally, this amendment will direct nearly $3 billion 
to efforts to aid those who have been affected by the devastating 
floods in the Midwest.

It is time for the President to listen to the American people who 
want the war in Iraq to end.
