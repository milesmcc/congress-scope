Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he 
may consume to Mr. Pence, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the 
Middle East and South Asia, whose minority staff director, Greg 
McCarthy, setting up the posters, is an Iraq war veteran and a marine 
as well.

(Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
