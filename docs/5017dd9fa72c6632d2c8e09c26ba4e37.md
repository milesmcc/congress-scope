# COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007

`Mr. COCHRAN â€” 19 July 2007`

---


Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have been very deeply disappointed with 
the response of Senate Democratic leaders to the President's nomination 
of Judge Leslie Southwick to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

I had expected that his nomination would move expeditiously through 
the Judiciary Committee and the Senate. He is emminently well 
qualified. But the opposition of some members of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee and some outside political interest groups has slowed action 
on the nomination.

I have known Leslie Southwick for 30 years. His qualifications are 
beyond question. During his distinguished career, as a lawyer and a 
State court judge, he has earned the respect and admiration of liberals 
and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, as well as fellow lawyers 
and judges who have worked closely with him and who know him well.

He is fair and thoughtful and would be an outstanding Federal court 
of appeals judge. The judiciary would be well served by his leadership 
and his knowledge of the law. He will reflect credit--enormous credit--
on the Federal judiciary.

He graduated cum laude from Rice University in 1972 and from the 
University of Texas School of Law in 1975.

Following law school, he clerked for the chief judge of the Texas 
Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin and then, in 1976, for Judge 
Charles Clark on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The next year he began the practice of law in Jackson, MS, with the 
firm of Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, one of our State's most 
respected law firms. He quickly became a respected member of the bar.

From 1989 to 1993, he served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General 
in the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. While there, 
he supervised the Federal Programs Branch and the Office of Consumer 
Litigation.

In November 1994, Judge Southwick was elected to serve on the 
Mississippi Court of Appeals. He was reelected to a second term in 
1998.

During 8 of the first 10 years on the court of appeals, Judge 
Southwick wrote the most opinions of anyone on the court. He has been 
involved in more than 7,000 opinions during his service on the 
Mississippi Court of Appeals, and he personally wrote almost 800 of 
them.

Judge Southwick also has a distinguished record of service in the 
Judge


Advocate General's Corps of the U.S. Army Reserves and has been an 
instructor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

In August 2004, Lieutenant Colonel Southwick and the 155th Brigade 
Combat Team of the Mississippi National Guard were mobilized in support 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit was deployed in Iraq from January 
to December 2005, where he served as the staff judge advocate. He spent 
much of his time in Najaf, an area of significant insurgent activity.

In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, one of Judge Southwick's 
fellow soldiers wrote this:




 He also took on the task of handling the claims of numerous 


 Iraqi civilians who had been injured or had property losses 


 due to [the involvement of] the United States Military in our 


 area of operations. This involved long days of interviewing 


 Iraqi civilian claimants, many of whom were children, widows 


 and elderly people, to determine whether the United States 


 Military could [or should] pay their claims. He always 


 listened to these Iraqi claimants patiently and treated them 


 with the utmost respect and kindness. He did this not just 


 out of a sense of duty but because he is a genuinely good and 


 caring person.


Judge Southwick is currently a professor of law at the Mississippi 
College School of Law. He teaches courses in administrative law, 
consumer law, evidence, statutory interpretation, and judicial history.

He has written several legal and historical articles that have been 
published in the Mississippi Law Journal, the Mississippi College Law 
Review, the Wall Street Journal, and other publications. He is the 
author of a book entitled: ''Presidential Also-Rans and Running 
Mates.'' It won an American Library Association prize as the ''Best 
Reference Work of the Year'' in 1985.

Judge Southwick has served as president of the American Inns of 
Court, as a member of the American Law Institute, and on the Curriculum 
Committee of the American Bar Association's Section on Legal Education. 
He was honored by the Mississippi State Bar in 2004 with the Judicial 
Excellence Award.

The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal 
Judiciary unanimously concluded that Judge Southwick is ''well 
qualified'' to serve as a Federal appellate judge. This is the highest 
rating a judicial nominee can receive.

After being nominated on June 6, 2006, to serve as a U.S. district 
court judge in the Southern District of Mississippi, he received a 
hearing in the Judiciary Committee in the Senate and was unanimously 
reported with a favorable recommendation for confirmation.

After two nominees for the Fifth Circuit from our State were turned 
down, Senator Lott and I recommended Judge Southwick for that court, 
and President Bush submitted his nomination to the Senate on January 9, 
2007.

In an editorial published in June 2006, the Clarion Ledger of 
Jackson, MS, called Judge Southwick's nomination ''an outstanding 
appointment.''

In an editorial published in June 2007, the Clarion Ledger stated 
that Judge Southwick had built a reputation based on ''professionalism, 
hard work, and integrity'' and that support of the nominee's home State 
Senators is an important indicator of broad consensus on the 
nomination.

This vacancy on the Fifth Circuit has now existed since 2004. This 
seat is considered a judicial emergency by the Federal judiciary, 
meaning the efficiency and efficacy of the court are negatively 
affected by this vacancy.

I am confident Judge Southwick will serve with great distinction on 
this court, and he will reflect great credit on the Federal judiciary, 
if he is confirmed.

I am proud of the recommendation Senator Lott and I have made to the 
Senate, and the Senate should confirm this nomination.

I mentioned the support of community leaders in my earlier remarks. I 
have been handed by staff members of mine a number of letters that have 
been sent.

Here is one, June 1, 2007, to Senator Leahy and Senator Specter. This 
is from the adjutant general of the Mississippi National Guard, MG 
Harold Cross. He mentions his experiences with Judge Southwick in Iraq. 
He started with a story I had not heard until I read this letter 
earlier today:




 Lieutenant Colonel Southwick joined the Army Reserve in 


 1992--obtaining an age waiver to allow him to join; even 


 though he knew from the outset his age would necessarily 


 prohibit him from serving long enough to vest a military 


 pension. In 1997, then-Captain Southwick transferred into the 


 Mississippi National Guard.



 While Lieutenant Colonel Southwick was originally assigned 


 to what was then called State Area Command, in 2003, 


 Lieutenant Colonel Southwick volunteered to transfer into the 


 155th Separate Armor Brigade, a line combat unit. This was a 


 courageous move; as it was widely known at the time that the 


 155th was nearly certain to mobilize for overseas duty in the 


 near future.


He then goes on to talk about the leadership, the military 
leadership, the assets and qualities that he brought to the 155th 
Brigade Combat Team on active duty near Najaf in Iraq.

He served, as my remarks indicated, as staff judge advocate for the 
155th, and it was located at Forward Operating Base Kalsu.

After his service in Iraq, Lieutenant Colonel Southwick transferred 
back to Joint Force Headquarters of the Mississippi National Guard. He 
makes this comment--General Cross does--in closing--




 While there are many core qualities critical to a 


 successful military officer, one attribute I have found 


 particularly important during my many years of service is 


 sound temperament. In that regard, Lieutenant Colonel 


 Southwick has both a considerate and measured personality. I 


 can tell you without hesitation that I have always found 


 Lieutenant Colonel Southwick to treat everyone with whom he 


 comes into contact with both kindness and respect.


Another letter, this one from a young lawyer with Brunini, Grantham, 
Grower & Hewes, the firm where Leslie Southwick practiced law for a 
number of years. This letter is addressed to Senator Arlen Specter.




 Dear Senator Specter:



 I am an African-American partner at the law firm of 


 Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, PLLC, where Judge 


 Southwick was once a member. I believe in fairness for all 


 people and salute our leaders for giving their lives to 


 assure that fairness. While I share the sentiments of other 


 African-Americans that the federal judiciary needs to be more 


 diverse, I believe that Judge Southwick is imminently 


 qualified for the United States Fifth Circuit Court of 


 Appeals and write in support of his nomination.



 I met Judge Southwick during my third year of law school 


 when I interned with the Court of Appeals of Mississippi. 


 That internship allowed me an opportunity to work with most 


 of the Judges on the bench at that time. I was most impressed 


 with Judge Southwick because of his work ethic and his serene 


 personality. When I finished law school in 1996, I believed 


 that my chances for landing a clerkship were slim because 


 there was only one African-American Court of Appeals judge on 


 the bench at the time and there were very few Caucasian 


 judges during the history of the Mississippi Supreme Court or 


 the Court of Appeals (which was fairly new) who had ever 


 hired African-American law clerks. In spite of the odds, I 


 applied for a clerkship. Judge Southwick granted me an 


 interview and hired me the same day. While Judge Southwick 


 had many applicants to choose from, he saw that I was 


 qualified for the position and granted me the opportunity.



 During my tenure as clerk with the Court, Judge Southwick 


 thought through every issue and took every case seriously. He 


 earned a reputation for his well thought out opinions and his 


 ability to produce the highest number of opinions in a term. 


 It did not matter the parties' affiliation, color, or 


 stature--what mattered was what the law said and Judge 


 Southwick worked very hard to apply it fairly. Judge 


 Southwick valued my opinions and included me in all of the 


 discussions of issues presented for decision. Having worked 


 closely with Judge Southwick, I have no doubt that he is 


 fair, impartial, and has all the other qualities necessary to 


 be an excellent addition to the United States Court of 


 Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.



 In addition to serving our State, Judge Southwick has also 


 honorably served our country. During his mission to Iraq in 


 2005, Southwick found the time to write me often to let me 


 know about his experiences there. Upon his return to the 


 United States, Judge Southwick shared with others his 


 humbling experience serving our country. It is clear from his 


 writings and speaking that he served with pride and dignity.



 Over the years, Judge Southwick has earned the reputation 


 of being a person of high morals, dignity, and fairness. It 


 is unfortunate that there are some who have made him the 


 chosen sacrifice to promote agendas and have set out to taint 


 all that Judge Southwick has worked so hard to accomplish. I 


 am prayerful that those efforts will not preclude Judge 


 Southwick from serving as our next judge on the United States 


 Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.



 Yours truly, Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, A. L'Verne 


 Edney


Mr. President, there are a number of other letters. There are two 
from the School of Law, Mississippi College where Judge Southwick has 
been a member of the faculty. One is from the


dean of the law school. Another is from the associate dean, Phillip 
McIntosh. I was impressed with his strong feeling that comes through in 
this letter that I detected and interpreted.




 Judge Southwick is a man--


And this is to Senator Specter and to Senator Leahy. He wrote each 
the same letter, dated June 4--




 Judge Southwick is a man of highest integrity, honor and 


 intellect. As a judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals, he 


 scrupulously did his judicial duty in following the law in 


 his judicial opinions. I am greatly disappointed that some 


 have taken the opportunity to try to score political points 


 by characterizing Judge Southwick as intolerant or having 


 ''very fixed, right-wing world view,'' seeking to imply that 


 he would not be fair and impartial in applying the law. In my 


 personal and professional dealings with him, I can attest to 


 his fine character. I have not the slightest doubt regarding 


 his impartiality and commitment to fairness.



 As an example of the regard with which Judge Southwick is 


 held by the law faculty at Mississippi College, he was 


 offered a position as a visiting faculty member following his 


 resignation as a judge for the Mississippi Court of Appeals 


 and pending the approval of his nomination with the Fifth 


 Circuit. The suggestion to make this offer was made by one of 


 our faculty members and the recommendation was unanimously 


 approved by our faculty. We have a politically and racially 


 diverse faculty, but not one note of concern about Judge 


 Southwick's integrity, fairness, or impartiality was sounded. 


 His appointment to our faculty was strongly supported by all 


 of our faculty members. I might even mention that his 


 teaching partner for trial practice this past semester is an 


 African American attorney and former Mississippi Circuit 


 Court judge whom Judge Southwick personally recruited to 


 partner with him for the course.



 I hope that you will support the nomination of this 


 outstanding man to the Fifth Circuit. He is an exceptional 


 candidate and deserving of confirmation.


There are other letters similar in tone. Here is one from--I couldn't 
help but notice--the University of Mississippi School of Law, the Law 
Center at the university where I graduated from law school, and it is 
written by John Bradley. It caught my attention because John Bradley 
was a law student when I was a law student. John Robin Bradley is what 
we called him then. He is now a professor of law at Ole Miss. He was 
one of the most liberal members of the faculty when he joined the 
faculty, and he has lived up to that tradition very proudly ever since.

I have a very high regard for John Bradley. He was editor in chief of 
the Law Journal, and when I was a first-year student, I had the honor 
of being invited to go to a Law Journal conference at William and Mary 
with John Robin and then the next editor to be, and I kept thinking I 
had just been anointed and I would be in line to be editor in chief 
also. That wasn't to be, but let me just say this: I am not sure John 
Robin Bradley has ever voted for me. He probably hasn't because I am a 
Republican and he is a very serious-minded Democrat. But here is a 
letter he wrote to Pat Leahy--and he also gave a copy to Arlen 
Specter--about Leslie Southwick, judicial nominee, dated June 5, 2007:




 Gentlemen:



 I write to comment to you and the Committee on the 


 Judiciary on the judicial and legal ability of Leslie 


 Southwick. I do so not in generalities but in the context 


 that I especially know about. It is my hope that this 


 specific information will give you insight into how he has 


 undertaken his role as a judge.



 My detailed knowledge of Leslie Southwick's work as a judge 


 on the Court of Appeals of Mississippi concerns the law of 


 workers' compensation and its important overlap with other 


 areas of law, principally tort law. For a number of years I 


 have taught and written about these topics. Consequently, I 


 pay extremely close attention to the court decisions. 


 Although based on statutes, this area of law has become 


 intricate and often complex, so much so that lawyers 


 specialize in the field in order to be effective.



 When Judge Southwick started as a first-time judge with the 


 newly-created Court of Appeals, he and some other judges had 


 little or no experience with this area of law. This showed up 


 in several opinions that I considered to contain incorrect 


 analyses. In articles that I wrote and in oral presentations 


 at law conferences, I often detailed the reasons that I 


 regarded some of the opinions as incorrect, including 


 several that Judge Southwick wrote or concurred in.



 My observation was that Judge Southwick recognized that he 


 and other judges needed to learn the intricacies and 


 complexities. He set about doing that. I saw him at all law 


 conferences at which I was a speaker, and I know he read and 


 often cited my publications. Sometimes he agreed and 


 sometimes he disagreed with my explanations, but the point 


 is--


And this is in italics--




 But the point is that he challenged himself to learn about 


 a field of law in which he had no previous experience, topics 


 which came to his court frequently.



 His court heard appeals in all areas of law, and we expect 


 broad institutional competence. Lawyers do not come to the 


 bench with all-encompassing experience, but the good ones can 


 and will learn. This is no small task. Judge Southwick--


And this again is in italics--




 Judge Southwick rose to the challenge by hard work, legal 


 ability, and dedication. I saw him struggle and I saw the 


 evidence of his learning about this field.



 This is what we hope for in our judges. Judge Southwick did 


 this and earned my respect for his legal and judicial 


 ability. My expectation is that he will continue on this path 


 as a judge.


That is the end of the italics.




 In my view his achievement in this regard is a significant 


 indicator that he has what it takes to be a good judge, one 


 of those humans to whom we entrust our halls of justice.



 Sincerely yours, John R. Bradley, Professor


This next letter is written in hand--handwritten--by Kay Cobb. Kay 
Cobb is the presiding justice of the Supreme Court of Mississippi. The 
letter is written to Senator Arlen Specter in reference to Judge Leslie 
H. Southwick.




 Dear Senator Specter.



 This letter is enthusiastically written to urge you and the 


 Committee to confirm Leslie H. Southwick to serve on the 


 Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I've known him for many years 


 and I'm honored to give him my highest recommendation without 


 reservation. In every way he is worthy to serve.



 Judge Southwick's scholarship and character are stellar. 


 The opinions he wrote during his 10 years on the Mississippi 


 Court of Appeals reflect his thoroughness and fairness, as 


 well as the depth of his knowledge and the quality and 


 clarity of his reasoning and writing.



 In every respect of his legal career and life in general, 


 Leslie Southwick has excelled. He has a long and consistent 


 record as a devoted family man, a courageous military leader, 


 an accomplished author, and an excellent appellate judge. His 


 awareness and attention to promoting fairness and equality 


 with regard to race and gender are exemplary.



 Our country needs conscientious and independent judges of 


 impeccable integrity, and I cannot think of anyone--


And she underlines ''anyone''--



 who is better qualified for this appointment.



 Sincerely, Kay B. Cobb, Presiding Justice, Supreme Court of 


 Mississippi.


There are other letters. I am not going to prolong my remarks. This 
is one from the dean of the Law School where he is on the faculty, 
another from one of his former partners. This one may be a little 
different. John Henegan--here is another Democrat, I think. I hope he 
is not upset with me for publicly identifying him in that way. He is a 
bright guy, widely respected. I know him. He has written a letter that 
talks about:




 One area where we have not worked closely together--


He is addressing Arlen Specter--




 One area where we have not worked closely together is in 


 the political arena.


I was right.




 I am a life long member of the Democratic party at all 


 levels of the political spectrum; namely, local, county 


 State, and Federal, and I have previously served as the Chief 


 of Staff and Executive Assistant to the former governor of 


 Mississippi who is also a life long Democrat. Accordingly, 


 although I am not qualified to call myself what we 


 affectionately refer to around here as a ''yellow dog 


 democrat,'' because I have at least on a handful of occasions 


 voted for a Republican candidate for public office, it is 


 very fair to say that I have never been a supporter of the 


 Republican Party or many of its policies, positions, or for 


 that matter certain Federal judicial nominees submitted to 


 the United States Senate in the past.



 In this context, I have been reading what has been said and 


 written about the qualifications of Leslie for this current 


 post, including an editorial in yesterday's New York Times, 


 and I cannot disagree more strongly with the personal attacks 


 that are being made against his character, integrity, or 


 fitness for office, or about his commitment to civil rights 


 for all people, regardless of their race, color, sex, creed, 


 religion, or national origin. It is an abomination that he 


 should have to experience these unfair and unjust personal 


 attacks, because they are quite simply untrue and cannot be 


 made by anyone who has had the opportunity to meet, work, or 


 be around Leslie for even an abbreviated period of time.



 In his many years of public service at the State and 


 Federal level, Leslie has served his State and his Nation 


 with honor and distinction at sacrifice to his personal gain. 


 I candidly can think of no one whom I would trust more to 


 carry out the oath of office that he will be required to take 


 and to uphold the




 laws of and Constitution of the United States if he is 


 confirmed by the United States Senate.



 I respectfully urge you to confirm his nomination. 


 Respectfully Submitted, John C. Henegan.


I am not going to read all of the letters, Madam President. I know 
others may want to speak on the legislation that is pending before the 
Senate.

This one is from a fellow member of the Mississippi Army National 
Guard. They were deployed together in Iraq recently and his observation 
is that ''he shouldered a heavy load of regular JAG duties, which he 
performed excellently.'' He talked about Southwick being a kind and 
courageous man, being in a combat zone with him, and how it was 
stressful and challenging. He said:




 Leslie always listened to these Iraqi claimants patiently 


 and treated them with the utmost respect and kindness. He did 


 this not just out of a sense of duty but because he is a 


 genuinely good and caring person.


This is from Norman Gene Hortman, Jr. He is from Laurel, MS, a lawyer 
with his own law firm there, a very respected person in our State.

There are other letters. I thought you might be interested in this 
one. It is from Jose Cantu. He is writing Chairman Leahy. This is a 
copy of his letter:




 Dear Chairman Leahy.



 I read recently in the Houston Chronicle about the 


 nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the United States 


 Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The article was 


 questioning his character in light of a case in a Mississippi 


 appellate court involving a racial incident where a ruling 


 was in favor of a white plaintiff. Since I grew up with Judge 


 Southwick in Edinburg, Texas, located in the Rio Grande 


 Valley, I was shocked to read about the opposition to his 


 nomination on this basis. I was a classmate of Judge 


 Southwick in high school and knew him very well. I always 


 found him to be extremely polite and absolutely fair with 


 everyone. What the paper and the political activist 


 referenced in the article imply is that Judge Southwick is a 


 racist because of the ruling on the Court. This is absolutely 


 ridiculous and totally unfair. The Valley has a large 


 Hispanic population, and Leslie never showed the type of 


 discriminatory attitudes that are implied in the article. To 


 the contrary, I remember him as treating everyone fairly and 


 with respect.



 What was equally disturbing in the Chronicle article was 


 LULAC's opposition to the nomination. Being a Hispanic 


 American, my immediate and extended family want to voice our 


 strong disagreement with LULAC on this issue. Since this 


 organization is portrayed by the media to speak for all 


 Hispanics, I want your office to know that it does not. My 


 family and I wholeheartedly support the nomination of Judge 


 Southwick. It is apparent from the article that LULAC has no 


 first-hand knowledge of Judge Southwick's character or 


 integrity, but merely wanted to jump on the bandwagon and 


 oppose this nomination because it was submitted by President 


 Bush. Growing up in the Valley, both my family and I have 


 been lifelong Democrats. Now I live in Houston and am 


 beginning to believe that politically motivated actions, like 


 opposition to the nomination of this fine individual and 


 jurist, will force many of us to seek the Republican Party as 


 a viable alternative. I respectfully request that you support 


 the nomination of Judge Southwick and confirm his appointment 


 for the Court of Appeals.



 Sincerely, Jose Alberto Cantu, CPA, PrimeWay Federal Credit 


 Union.


Here is someone I noticed because she has been an active Democrat all 
her adult life, a good friend of mine, Kathryn H. Hester, a shareholder 
in the Jackson, MS, law firm of Watkins Ludlam Winter & Stennis. You 
have heard of Winter and Stennis. You may have heard of Watkins and 
Ludlam. They are both deceased. It reads:




 Re: Nomination of Leslie Southwick for the United States 


 Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.



 Dear Chairman Leahy.



 I write in support of my colleague Leslie Southwick's 


 nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the 


 Fifth Circuit. You will have before you Leslie's resume. It 


 is outstanding, and it reflects both a sense of duty and an 


 intelligence appropriate for service as an appellate judge.



 Judge Southwick succeeded me as President of the Charles 


 Clark Inn of Court--named for the former Chief Judge for the 


 Fifth Circuit for whom Leslie clerked after law school. 


 Leslie was selected to that position by trial and defense 


 lawyers of the utmost professional skill and integrity.



 Leslie is diligent in performing his obligations, he is 


 smart, he has integrity, and he is temperate in his actions 


 and decisions. Leslie is passionate about love of country, 


 his alma mater's baseball team (Rice), and his adopted State, 


 Mississippi.



 If a man of intelligence, temperance and integrity, who has 


 served his country, his State, and his profession honorably 


 and with dignity, is not qualified to be on the court of 


 appeals, then the process is faulty. The legal profession and 


 the parties who will depend on his intelligence and his 


 integrity deserve to have a person of his caliber on the 


 court.



 Thank you for your consideration.



 Sincerely yours,



 Kathryn H. Hester,



 Shareholder.


Madam President, I think I have read enough letters. I didn't mean to 
read as many as I did. But I hope that Senators will see from these 
letters they are not form letters organized by any political party or 
any special interest group. These are letters that were written because 
people care about and know about Leslie Southwick and are convinced he 
is being treated unfairly by the Senate if he is not confirmed.

I know the Judiciary Committee has had a hearing. I was pleased to 
introduce Leslie Southwick at that time, with my colleague Senator 
Lott. It never occurred to me at any moment that there would be any 
question raised about his integrity, his sense of fairness, his 
qualifications, or his fitness to serve as a U.S. Court of Appeals 
judge during the consideration by the Senate of this nomination. The 
fact that I feel obliged to be here on the floor, after I had made my 
comments about how I thought he was a good choice to serve on the 
court, is probably superfluous. I apologize if anybody is bored by 
these remarks. But I hope you can sense the sincerity and seriousness 
of purpose of those who have written and the high quality of the people 
who authored these letters.


To me, it is a dark and sad day in the Senate if one of its 
committees, the Judiciary Committee, is considering recommending that 
Judge Southwick not be confirmed for service on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals. It is unthinkable. But from information I have gotten from 
those who talked to all of the members of the committee on the 
Democratic side, that might happen. I don't know when a meeting is 
scheduled or when that is going to occur, but I hope there is an 
opportunity for reflection and careful consideration of action before 
that meeting does occur. I served my first 2 years in the Senate on the 
Judiciary Committee. I succeeded Jim Eastland, who had been chairman of 
the committee, when he retired from the Senate. That was in the Carter 
administration, and we had a lot of hot-button issues come before the 
committee. It was an interesting challenge to be on the committee 
during such a period of national transition. Alan Simpson and I were 
two junior Republicans on the committee that year.

I guess the point is, I listened to presentations made before the 
committee for judicial nominees. I was observing and we were living 
through the transition in the South--the integration of organizations, 
of schools, of churches, on and on. It was a very challenging time in 
the history of our country. Ted Kennedy had just become chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee. It was a pleasure to serve and get to know all the 
people on the committee at the time. But I also remember thinking 
somewhere along after about 6 months of experience on the committee 
that maybe the best thing I could do for my career in the Senate was 
get the heck off the Judiciary Committee and get on something a little 
more attractive from a political standpoint. So as it happened, it 
worked out that 2 years later I was able to move to the Appropriations 
Committee. I gave up that seat on the Judiciary Committee to do so. I 
have always felt a special kinship for the members of that committee, 
knowing about the workload, the volume of information that has to be 
processed by the members to stay up to date with the legislation that 
is referred to the Judiciary Committee. So I have an appreciation for 
the challenges that are faced and particularly on a nomination that 
comes along that is not from your State, not from your area of the 
country. You take a look at what the facts are, make a decision, and 
move along.

Well, I hope the Judiciary Committee will take another look at this 
nomination and look at what has been said about the nominee and his 
qualifications, and look at his entire career, which has been one that 
has reflected good judgment, a concern for his fellow citizens, whether 
they are Black, White, or Hispanic, or whether they are Democrats or 
Republicans. He is the ideal choice for this kind of job. And to 
absolutely contrive reasons to persuade others to vote against the 
nominee creates a bad feeling and a sense of unfairness that is 
pervading the body.



Madam President, I have said enough.

I ask unanimous consent that the letters I did read from be printed 
in the Record.
