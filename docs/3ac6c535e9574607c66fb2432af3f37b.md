Mr. MARTINEZ. I appreciate the Senator's comments, and I so much 
value our relationship and our ability to work across the aisle, 
because we seem to get a lot done when we do that. It is an encouraging 
sign on one of the very difficult issues of our day, which is 
immigration, that we do seem to be working in a bipartisan way, and it 
is amazing what can be accomplished when we do work bipartisanly.

I can't help but be shaped by my own life experience, and I remember 
as I came to America and was learning the ways of this country, and I 
admired so much this new land of mine, that I would marvel at the 
phrase: ''Politics ends at the water's edge.'' That used to be the 
standard. There were these towering giants of another day who occupied 
these very desks we now use as ours who seemed to find it within 
themselves to reach a little higher to work across party lines in those 
postwar years, in the Cold War years when it was so essential.

I think what we need to adopt as a country is the understanding that 
this struggle against this enemy is long term, that we are going to be 
in this fight for a long time, probably the time of your service and 
mine. I hope not, but perhaps. If we are going to be successful in that 
endeavor, we have to set politics aside. We have to find a way that we 
can think of America first and whatever label we wear in a secondary 
way. I am not preaching to my colleague from Florida or anyone in 
particular. Frankly, the blame lies on both sides of the aisle, with 
Republicans as well as Democrats. We have to find a way we can move 
beyond the momentary gain we might make over a 24-hour news cycle for 
the longer term good of the Nation and the longer term good of what 
America stands for to the world.

Anyway, maybe the Senator and I began a rare moment here this morning 
in talking about Iraq where we are not yelling at each other and we are 
actually talking about how we can bridge our differences and find 
consensus as something that will help the American people.
