Mr. AKIN. Reclaiming my time, there are some records being broken, 
aren't there? What we've seen is a lot of complaints over the last 
years about the high cost of the war in Iraq, the high cost of war in 
Afghanistan, President Bush just squandering and spending way too much 
money. And a number of us voted not to spend some of that money. But 
there were a lot of complaints.

And then you take a look, you add up the entire cost of the war in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, add it together, and within the first 5 weeks 
here in the Congress, the Democrats passed a bill at $840 billion that 
was more than those two wars combined over a 6- and 7-year period.

This is a record-setting Congress when it comes to spending. If 
spending is going to make the economy strong, we're going to have the 
best economy the world has ever seen.

We're joined by a good friend from Louisiana, Congressman Scalise. 
Comment on this first hundred days. Let's talk about records and what 
kinds of things we've seen here.
