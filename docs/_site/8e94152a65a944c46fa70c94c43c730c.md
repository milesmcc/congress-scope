Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, today marks an historic vote, one that will go 
down in history and signal a turning pointing in the war in Iraq. Much 
like the vote authorizing the President to go to war in 2002, this vote 
will be a defining moment, and one that will be discussed and debated 
for years to come.

While I do not believe this is a perfect bill, I personally would 
vote to bring our troops home today if that was an option, in fact this 
bill is the best compromise that could be adopted. Finally, there is an 
end in sight to this ill-conceived war, and Congress is sending a 
message to the Iraqis, that our sons and


daughters will not continue to shed blood to defend their country 
indefinitely.

We are sending the Iraqi government a message, that the time to step 
up their own efforts to bring peace and stability to their own land is 
fast approaching.

Mr. Speaker, this vote is one of conscience and the decision to vote 
for or against it is deeply personal. But let us make no mistake, the 
consequences of our actions here today will be widely felt and the 
impact will be broad and far-ranging. The American people are watching 
closely, and the eyes of the world are on us as well.

Today's vote is an example of what makes America great and what makes 
our democracy so strong. The fact that we, as elected Members of 
Congress, can express the will of the American people and compel the 
Administration to alter its misguided policies of war, demonstrates the 
essence of American society.

After years of having a free reign, with no accountability, 
consultation, or oversight from Congress, the President will now be 
compelled to listen to the will of Congress, and therefore the will of 
the American people.

Winning the war in Iraq will require a political and diplomatic 
offensive, not sending more of our men and women into harm's way to 
facilitate a civil war. With a clear conscience, but a heavy heart I 
cast my vote for the Iraq supplemental. My only solace is that we 
finally can see an end to this ill-fated war.
