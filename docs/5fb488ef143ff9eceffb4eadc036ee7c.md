Mr. LEVIN. I don't think working closely with the Commission 
collaboratively in any way means they are not going to report to us. 
They will continue to report to the Congress. There is no shift of the 
reporting function. As a matter of fact, the IG for Iraq does not have 
the authority which should have been given to him, and would now be 
given to him by this bill, for instance, on logistics support 
contracts. Why in heaven's name should the special IG not have 
logistics support contracts jurisdiction?
