Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the American people want the war in Iraq 
to end and the troops to be brought home. Why then is this House 
preparing to capitulate to the Bush White House and let the war 
continue? We have learned that the Democratic compromise with the 
President is to make withdrawal timetables nonbinding.

We have the power to end the war now. We should not give the 
President another dime for the war. We should not permit this war to 
continue to go on. Yet this House passed a $97 billion supplemental 
which gives the President money to keep the war going through September 
of 2008, and then a week later approved the President's budget for 
another $195 billion for Iraq to keep the war going into 2009. And now 
we are talking about a nonbinding timetable for withdrawal.

What is the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans on 
the war? Well, the Republicans do not want any timetables for 
withdrawal at all, and the Democrats, well, the Democrats want 
nonbinding timetables for withdrawal.
