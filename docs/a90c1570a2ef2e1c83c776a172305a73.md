# COMMEMORATING 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF ADA AND RECOGNIZING SPEAKER PRO  TEMPORE LANGEVIN
## `a90c1570a2ef2e1c83c776a172305a73`
`Ms. PELOSI â€” 26 July 2010`

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, our distinguished majority leader referenced 
that we had a special guest here today. I want to acknowledge the 
presence of Mr. Minnick's guest, Corporal Randal Wright. He lost both 
legs and a hand in Afghanistan.

I think it's important that we have this juxtapositioning. As Mr. 
Patrick Kennedy said today in his remarks, we have many of our brave 
men and women in uniform who are fighting the fight for our country. 
They come home, many of them, with physical disabilities. We want them 
all to think about serving in Congress.

So this, Corporal Randal Wright, is about you and your colleagues as 
well. Mr. Langevin has led the way. We want to take this opportunity to 
thank you for your patriotism, your courage, and your sacrifice for our 
country.



I want to thank Mr. Minnick and Mr. Marshall, the author of the 
Veterans Disabilities Act, for bringing Corporal Wright here. And Steny 
tells me that Corporal Wright got married this week as well.

So, my colleagues, once again let us congratulate Mr. Langevin for 
presiding with such dignity over the House on this historic day. 
Congratulations and thank you.
