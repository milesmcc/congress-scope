Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Specialist Donovan D. 
Witham of Malvern, Arkansas, who died on August 20, 2007, fighting for 
our country in Iraq while supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was 20 
years old when he selflessly gave his life for his country during 
combat operations.

Specialist Witham graduated from Glen Rose High School in 2005 where 
he was active in athletics and numerous extracurricular activities as a 
student. As a member of the student council, drama club and choir, as 
well as the football and track teams, he was a natural leader who 
demonstrated hard work and teamwork both in the classroom and on the 
field. Before joining the Army, he continued to give back to his 
community and state by working at the Ouachita River Correctional Unit. 
He was also an avid sportsman who enjoyed hunting and fishing at every 
opportunity.

Specialist Witham joined the Army in November 2005, and his proud 
service will continue to live on and serve as an inspiration to the 
many soldiers who knew him and fought alongside him in combat. He was a 
military police officer with the 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 
2nd Brigade Combat Team, in the 82nd Airborne Division. His bravery and 
courage as a military police officer and as a paratrooper were 
exemplified by his numerous awards and military decorations, including 
the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart Medal.

Specialist Donovan Witham gave his life to serve our country and he 
will forever be remembered as a leader, a hero, a son, a brother and a 
friend. My deepest condolences go out to his mother, Martha Launius, 
and his stepfather, Richard Launius of Malvern; and his three sisters, 
Amber Sharp of Magnolia, Jamie Witham of Benton and Virginia Bennett of 
Magnolia. He will be missed by his family, his community, his country 
and all those who knew him. I will continue to keep Specialist Donovan 
Witham's family in my deepest thoughts and prayers.
