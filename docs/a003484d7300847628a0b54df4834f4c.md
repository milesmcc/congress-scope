Mr. KERRY. Is the Senator aware that 60 percent of Iraq is Shia, that 
Shia are viewed by al-Qaida as complete apostates outside of Islam, 
that they do not get along, that the Kurds do not get along--and they 
are 20 percent of Iraq; therefore, 80 percent of Iraq will have nothing 
to do with al-Qaida--and now the Sunni in Anbar decided they do not 
want anything to do with al-Qaida, and that most of the injuries to our 
troops are from IEDs, and that most of the conflict in Iraq that has 
moved 2 million people out of Iraq and 2 million people within Iraq and 
changed Baghdad from 60 percent Sunni to 75 percent Shia--is he aware 
that, in fact, al-Qaida is not responsible for that, but it is the 
Jaysh al-Mahdi and it is the militia and it is the Badr army and 
everybody except for, fundamentally, al-Qaida that is doing that?

That is the fundamental violence and conflict which requires the 
political settlement General Petraeus cannot produce, only the Iraqi 
politicians can produce. Is he aware of that?
