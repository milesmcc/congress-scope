`Mr. SCOTT of Georgia â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I too want to thank Mr. Tanner, 
Mr. Abercrombie, and Mr. Skelton and our Republican colleagues for 
coming together.

Mr. Speaker, this is what I refer to as a soaring golden moment in 
this Congress because this is the beginning. This is a beginning of 
effective planning for bringing conclusion in a very responsible way to 
what the American people truly want.

And why is this a golden moment? This is a golden moment in this 
House because the only way that we are going to bring this Iraqi 
situation to a positive conclusion is with Democrats working with 
Republicans.



Democrats cannot do it by ourselves, Republicans cannot do it by 
themselves.

The other point why this is a golden moment, Mr. Speaker, is because 
this shows, and the process of this legislation and the reporting and 
the involvement of the Congress shows, that we are not going to make 
the same mistake ending our involvement in Iraq that we made in going 
in; and that was poor planning, bad information, and ineffective 
intelligence. That's why I commend this.

It's very important for the American people to see us finally, as 
Democrats and Republicans, working together in this start to take this 
great step. And let us dare not lose this golden moment of bipartisan 
cooperation.
