# STRONG SUPPORT OF PRIVILEGED RESOLUTION
## `b496c253e51050765febd1245aad03af`
`Mr. EVERETT â€” 23 October 2007`

Mr. EVERETT. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
privileged resolution to censure Representative Pete Stark (CA), 
offered by the Republican Leader. Like many of my colleagues, I was 
disgusted by the comments of the gentleman from California, Mr. Stark.

Regardless of his personal feelings on the war in Iraq or any other 
issue before Congress, Mr. Stark's comments were distasteful and not in 
keeping with the traditions of the House of Representatives. His 
despicable statements on October 18, 2007 .about the Commander in 
Chief, his colleagues in Congress, and the men and women who are 
serving our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan should be condemned.

Mr. Stark just doesn't get it. The service and sacrifice of our men 
and women in uniform deserve to be honored and applauded in Congress--
not chided and denigrated by his senseless remarks. I found his recent 
actions on the floor of the House to be extremely disrespectful of our 
military and our Commander in Chief. We face serious challenges at home 
and abroad and Mr. Stark should consider the impact of these comments 
before opening his mouth in the future.
