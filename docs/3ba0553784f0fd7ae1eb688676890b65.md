Mr. HOYER. I think that's, candidly, still up in the air. I know 
that's of concern to you. I understand that concern, but I will tell 
you again, I think it's still up in the air.

Mr. Obey has been discussing with the Senate how they think we can 
best move forward as expeditiously as possible and so that we can try 
to achieve the end.

As you know, there is substantial discussion about what is in the 
supplemental. The President, as you know, has indicated that and Mr. 
Nussel has indicated that if anything above the dollars asked 
essentially for Iraq and Afghanistan are included for investment here 
in this country on various different items, perhaps dealing with 
unemployment insurance, perhaps dealing with energy credits so that we 
can ensure the expansion of alternative enterprises for alternative 
fuels, those are all being discussed to see whether they are 
possibilities in terms of passage and, hopefully, signature by the 
President.

We think that there are a number of items that are critically 
important to pass now that we think this bill is appropriate for but we 
don't have agreement on at this point in time. But Mr. Obey is working 
today and hopefully tomorrow, and we have a number of meetings today to 
see if we can move that forward.

So I regret I do not have a more definitive answer for you, but that 
is the candid answer.
