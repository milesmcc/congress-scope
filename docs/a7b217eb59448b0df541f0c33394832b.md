Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Obama 
administration's war strategy in Afghanistan and to the war funding 
contained in this bill. It is evident to me that this strategy is not 
working.

Just this past weekend, CIA Director Leon Panetta said on national 
television that, regarding Taliban insurgents, ''We have seen no 
evidence that they are truly interested in reconciliation where they 
would surrender their arms, where they would denounce al-Qaeda, where 
they would really try to become part of that society.'' One day later, 
General Petreaus--our newly named commander for the war in 
Afghanistan--told the Congress ''. . . whether or not very senior 
[Taliban] leaders can meet the very clear conditions that the Afghan 
government has laid down for reconciliation I think is somewhat in 
question. So in that regard, I agree with Director Panetta.''

Substitute ''Viet Cong'' for ''Taliban'' and ''South Vietnamese 
government'' for ''Afghan government'' and you'll understand why all of 
this sounds painfully familiar. It's because we've seen this before, 
and we know how it ends.

I do not say these things lightly, as I voted for the authorization 
for the use of force in 2001 in order to find and bring to justice the 
al Qaeda leaders who organized the 9/11 attacks against our country. 
Unfortunately, the previous administration did not put enough troops on 
the ground to prevent bin Laden's escape, and nearly 9 years later he 
and his key lieutenants whereabouts remain a mystery to our 
intelligence community, as Director Panetta acknowledged last weekend. 
In other words, the original rationale for going to Afghanistan is 
gone.

We face a nationalist insurgency that we cannot defeat militarily and 
that will not negotiate a political settlement with the corrupt Afghan 
government. We have tripled the number of troops on the ground since 
the beginning of 2009, and the violence has only soared. Every day we 
remain only increases our national debt and subjects our troops to 
needless peril. Indeed, every month we squander enough money on this 
war that could otherwise be used to put an additional 38,000 police on 
our streets for a full year, or to prevent massive teacher layoffs in 
every state, particularly New Jersey. The cost of this war is directly 
imperiling the hometown security of communities across this nation and 
the economic security of our children and grandchildren.



Mr. Speaker, when President Obama asked us to support his new 
strategy, I did so reluctantly and with this caveat: I would give the 
President time to show his approach could work, but that my patience 
had limits. In the nearly 18 months that President Obama has had the 
opportunity to demonstrate his approach, we've tripled the number of 
Americans in Afghanistan, our casualties have skyrocketed, and the 
insurgency has deepened and spread across the country. My patience, and 
now support for this strategy, have evaporated. We do more harm than 
good by staying: more harm to our troops and our economy, and more harm 
to innocent Afghans who too often are caught in the crossfire. It's 
time for us to go, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to 
bring our troops home by ending funding for this conflict.

The bill before us makes critical investments in education which are 
fully paid for by cutting funds from existing programs.

The current economic downturn has hit school districts hard, and many 
are being forced to cut services. Previously, the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act made several sound investments in public education to 
keep teachers in the classroom and help school districts avoid painful 
cuts.

Most, if not all, of this emergency funding has been spent. Further, 
at this most critical time, Governor Christie made the wrong call in 
cutting state aid to our local schools.

The $10 billion included for the Education Jobs Fund will help keep 
teachers in the classroom and make sure that class sizes do not balloon 
next fall. This much needed funding will help preserve 140,000 teaching 
jobs nationwide.

This package also contains almost $5 billion, fully offset as well, 
to ensure college students who receive Pell Grants, 8 million this 
year, will have the financial support for college they need.
