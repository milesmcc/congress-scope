`Mr. CORNYN â€” 12 December 2007`

Mr. CORNYN. To be clear, we have had objections from the majority, 
from our Democratic friends, to legislation that is vitally important 
to our veterans and to our active-duty military: the Veterans' 
Administration and military construction funding bill that was passed 
by both Houses of the Congress last summer and which has been held up 
and held hostage to the political games here in Washington, as well as 
the emergency troop funding that is needed to fund ongoing operations 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, which we have discussed as well. This is a 
personal issue, as 1.7 million veterans live in my State in Texas. We 
have 15 major military bases where military families live and work. One 
out of every 10 active-duty military members who wears the uniform of 
the United States calls Texas home, and we have guards and reservists 
who are also serving valiantly in Iraq and elsewhere.

The bill which has been blocked by the majority would provide $20 
billion in military construction funds important for our troops and 
quality of life for our military families, and it is important to my 
State of Texas because of our support for the troops and military 
families. It contains almost $90 billion for our veterans, which 
includes their health care, upgrading facilities, money to hire 
additional claims processors so veterans don't have to wait so long to 
get the benefits to which they are entitled. As I said, there are about 
1.7 million veterans in Texas and they need these funds, and they 
shouldn't be held hostage to the political games here in Washington 
with regard to an omnibus appropriations bill.

Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our 
time.
