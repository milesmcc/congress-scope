Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in 
the consideration of H.R. 3325 which names a postal facility in 
Suffield, Connecticut, after CPL Stephen R. Bixler. H.R. 3325, which 
was introduced by Representative Joe Courtney on August 2, 2007, was 
reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice 
vote. This measure has the support of the entire Connecticut 
congressional delegation.

Madam Speaker, Marine CPL Stephen R. Bixler was killed on May 4, 
2006, while conducting combat operations against enemy forces in al 
Anbar Province, Iraq. He was assigned to 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, 
2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, North 
Carolina.

LTC James M. Bright, the battalion's commander, said, ''Corporal 
Bixler was a vibrant, active man. He died fearlessly leading and 
willingly sacrificing his own safety for those around him.''

Corporal Bixler was a devoted soldier with strength of character and 
self-assurance. He served his country with honor and distinction.

Madam Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
Courtney) for introducing this legislation and urge swift passage of 
the bill.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
