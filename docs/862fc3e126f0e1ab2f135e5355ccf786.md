`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 19 April 2007`

Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Speaker, when you listen to the debate, you can understand that 
we could be in Iraq for many, many years to come and could expand the 
war beyond Iraq unless we take a new approach which places diplomacy as 
the path to peace.

Mr. Speaker, our soldiers didn't lose the war. I maintain the war was 
lost the minute the White House fabricated a cause for war. The Bible 
says that which is crooked cannot be made straight, and our adventure 
in Iraq will prove the Bible was right.

On the one hand, some of my friends do not believe in any timetable 
to withdraw from Iraq, which means we could stay in Iraq indefinitely; 
on the other hand, some of my friends believe in timetables, even 
nonbinding timetables, which means we could stay in Iraq indefinitely.

I believe we are being presented with an insufficient choice. 
Congress is under no obligation to appropriate any more money for this 
war, yet we give the President $100 billion. We are under no obligation 
to give him any money to continue the war. We can best support the 
troops by using money that is in the pipeline to bring the troops home. 
I believe that is what the American people want.

Congress recently approved $97 billion in the supplemental. That 
could keep the war going well into next summer. Congress approved a 
budget a week later that would keep the war going into 2009.

Nearly 200 people died in the carnage in Baghdad yesterday. We 
understand that the occupation is fueling the insurgency. Our troop 
casualties are mounting towards 3,300. Last night, I spoke to the 
sister of one of those casualties who was a young Marine from my 
district. She raised the plea, what can we do to end this war?

Innocent civilian casualties are rising. The conservative estimate in 
June 2006 of the Lancet Report set at 650,000 the number of innocent 
civilian casualties. It is quite possible that at this time those 
casualties could be approaching 1 million. The cost of the war is 
upwards of $800 billion into 2008. We are borrowing money from China to 
wage a war in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Murtha's account of the disaster to our military 
does not need to be added to. But what should be said right now is that 
we are facing limited choices, and that is why, Mr. Speaker, I have 
proposed H.R. 1234, a plan to end the war, which begins with Congress 
not funding the war, pulling the plug on funding and moving forward 
with a plan that reaches out to the international community to get out 
of Iraq.
