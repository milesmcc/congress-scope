Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield so I can ask a question? I see we 
have one of our colleagues waiting to speak.

I wonder what the Senator thinks. We held a hearing yesterday with 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is highly regarded. He 
conveys to every questioner, no matter which Member it is, a sense of 
urgency because of his belief and that of our military commanders on 
the ground that we are not winning.

In fact, in the words of Admiral Mullen: Time is not on our side.

Yet today, the President of the United States came out, after meeting 
with the Canadian Prime Minister, and basically said he is--after his 
spokesperson said he is going to take weeks and weeks to make a 
decision, he came out and basically said there is not a sense of 
urgency; that the strategy that was developed in March was not the 
operative strategy, even though Admiral Mullen said the March strategy 
was the operative strategy, and all we need to do is fill in the 
resources and the strategy.

My question to my friend from South Carolina is, how do you account 
for this apparent contradiction or difference in view about the sense 
of urgency that exists in the conflict in Afghanistan?
