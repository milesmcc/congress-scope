Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
District of Columbia Voting Rights Act of 2007, which corrects a 200-
year-old oversight by restoring to the citizens of the District of 
Columbia the right to elect a Member of the House of Representatives 
who has the same voting rights as all other Members of the House of 
Representatives.

Residents of the District of Columbia serve in the military. They are 
dying and being wounded on the streets of Iraq. They pay billions of 
dollars in Federal taxes each year and assume all of the 
responsibilities of United States citizenship. Yet they are denied the 
basic right of full representation in the United States House of 
Representatives.

Now, a compromise has been reached by both sides of the aisle, but 
there are some who would deny the people of Washington, D.C., a right 
that they themselves enjoy.

The District of Columbia was created to prevent any State from unduly 
influencing the operations of the Federal Government due to the Federal 
Government's being located within the confines of a particular State. 
However, there is simply no evidence that the Framers of the 
Constitution thought it was necessary to keep residents of this 
District from being represented in the United States House of 
Representatives by a voting Member.

Now, there are those who would argue that Congress lacks the power to 
extend this right of full voter representation to the citizens of the 
District of Columbia. However, article I, section 8, clause 17 of the 
Constitution provides Congress with the legislative authority to give 
the District of Columbia true representation in Congress. I quote: The 
Congress shall have power ''to exercise exclusive Legislation in all 
Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding 10 miles square) . 
. .''

So let us stand with the thousands who marched down Pennsylvania 
Avenue Monday for one thing, full representation by Members of the 
House of Representatives for the District of Columbia.
