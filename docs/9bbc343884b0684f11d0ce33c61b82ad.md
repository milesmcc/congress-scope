`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 18 June 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. I would like to thank Mr. Altmire and Ms. 
Wasserman Schultz.

Mr. Speaker, we have to remember that $2 billion-plus a week are 
being spent in Iraq as we are here trying to resolve issues that we 
don't have money to resolve them.

Also I think it is important, at the top of the hour I meant to give 
this report, but as of this morning, June 18, 2007, at 10 a.m. the 
death total in Iraq is 3,517. Wounded in action and returned to duty is 
14,283. Wounded in action and not returning to duty is 11,667. I think 
it is important that we share that with the Members constantly.

Mr. Speaker, I am also asking Members, I am trying to find a picture 
and I have been looking high and low for somebody to e-mail us a 
picture of this great White House meeting that the President had with 
the Republicans standing behind him saying they won't participate in 
overriding his veto of accountability in Iraq. I need that picture 
because we need that to be a chart so that we can discourage our 
friends on the other side of the aisle from going down and standing in 
the schoolhouse door on behalf of the majority of Americans' 
priorities.

Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to address the House once again.
