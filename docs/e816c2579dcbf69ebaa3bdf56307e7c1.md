Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
welcome home Army SPC Joel Morera. Specialist Morera was wounded in 
Iraq on July 28, 2007, when an explosive device hit his vehicle.

Specialist Joel Morera received a Purple Heart in August. The Purple 
Heart is awarded to members of the Armed Forces of the United States 
who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands of the enemy.

Today, SPC Morera and his family will arrive back home in Clewiston, 
FL, so that he can celebrate the holidays in his hometown. I join the 
veterans and residents of Highlands County, Hendry County and Glades 
County in paying our respects to SPC Morera and celebrating his return 
to the Sunshine State.

I rise today with great pride to honor this brave young man and to 
thank him for his incredible sacrifice. The courage of SPC Morera and 
his fallen comrades ensure that all Americans can enjoy liberty.

Madam Speaker, please join me and the communities of the 16th 
District of Florida in welcoming Army Specialist Joel Morera and his 
family home for the holidays.
