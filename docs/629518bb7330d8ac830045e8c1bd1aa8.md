Ms. LEE. I just wanted to make this one point because I listened very 
closely to what the fiscal arguments were on this bill. And it's hard 
to believe that you continue to fund this occupation in Iraq, yet you 
talk about the fact that we don't have the resources to create schools 
worthy of our children.

So I think this is about priorities. And I hope that everyone on both 
sides will vote for this bill in a bipartisan fashion.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for yielding. I support this 
bill and hope we all vote for it.
