`Mr. DORGAN â€” 30 January 2008`

---


Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to be introducing legislation--
I have previously introduced this--that deals with the construction in 
the Congress of what is called a Truman Committee.

In fact, President Truman was from the home State of the Presiding 
Officer and the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee on the 
floor. So the two Senators from Missouri, of course, I know harbor 
great pride in Harry Truman.

One of the interesting things about Truman's tenure here in 
Washington, DC was not just his service in the Senate and not just him 
being President, but one of the sources of pride was his stewardship of 
something called the Truman Committee.

At a time when a President of his own party was in power in the White 
House, he and the Congress created a committee here in the Senate to 
take a look at waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting, particularly in 
the military. It cost him $15,000 to start it. Estimates are they saved 
$15 billion--in dollars from that time. Think of that: $15,000 to start 
the committee and saved $15 billion.

Now I know there are some who will disagree, but I happen to think it 
is long past time for us to be far more aggressive to find out what is 
happening to all this money. I will give you a couple of examples. One 
I have used a lot--I shall not today--by bringing a towel to the floor 
of the Senate, but I have held up a towel that Henry Bunting brought. 
He was a buyer for Kellogg, Brown, and Root, a subsidiary of 
Halliburton. He was a buyer stationed in Kuwait. One of the things he 
was to do was buy hand towels for American soldiers. So he filed out 
the order for hand towels. His supervisor saw it and said: No, we are 
not going to buy those hand towels; we are going to buy hand towels 
with the initials of our company embroidered on the hand towels, KBR.

He said: Well, that will almost triple the cost. He was told: That 
does not matter; this is a cost-plus contract. The American taxpayer is 
going to pick up that tab.

So they ordered the towels that cost four or five times more. It did 
not matter; the taxpayers pick up the tab. That little towel is a very 
small reminder of what has been going on and how much the taxpayer has 
been fleeced. There is so much more.

Why do we need to track these things? Well, Paul Mullinax is a good 
reason. I called Paul Mullinax one Sunday. He was a truck driver in 
Florida. Here is what Paul Mullinax did. This is a good example of 
contracting in FEMA.

Paul Mullinax drives a refrigerated 18-wheeler. He was in Florida. He 
got a call from FEMA when Hurricane Katrina hit. They needed ice down 
in the Gulf of Mexico. So Paul Mullinax, God bless him, drove up, and 
he picked up some ice in New York for a FEMA contract; picked up a load 
of ice in his refrigerated truck. They said: Take it to Carthage, MO. 
This is ice that is destined for the Gulf of Mexico for the relief of 
the Katrina victims.

He drove his truck from New York to Carthage, MO; got there, they 
said: No, you are not supposed to be in Carthage, MO; you are supposed 
to be in Montgomery, AL. So he turned his truck south and east and went 
to Montgomery, AL. When he got there, he said there were over 100 18-
wheel trucks. They had him park. He sat there for about 12 days with 
his refrigerated unit running on his truck. After about 12 or so days 
they sent him to Gloucester, MA, to offload his ice. This is ice 
destined for victims of Katrina. He picked it up in New York, went to 
Carthage, went to Alabama, and then they said: Offload it in a 
warehouse in Massachusetts, 15,000 bucks for that truckload of ice.

There were another 100 18-wheelers sitting where he was sitting. 
Should somebody ask questions and say: Who on Earth is responsible for 
this? The answer is yes. Waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting is 
epidemic. It is unbelievable.

Connected to the Katrina issue, this is a photograph, of course, of 
8,420 brandnew, never-used FEMA trailers clogging an unused airport. 
The question is: Who made that decision and why? Were there any 
consequences as a result of this decision? I do not know.

This is money wrapped in Saran Wrap. Hundred dollar bills. This guy, 
by the way, told me--this is in a basement in Baghdad. This guy told me 
that they wrapped this money in Saran Wrap and occasionally threw it 
around like a football because it is about the size of a football--I 
have never wrapped hundred dollar bills. I have never seen that many 
hundred dollar bills. But if you wrap hundred dollar bills in Saran 
Wrap, I guess that is what it looks like. He said they actually threw 
them around like footballs in that room in Baghdad. The reason these 
were wrapped in Saran Wrap, with some rubber bands around them, is 
because this guy was in charge of distributing the money. He said we 
were paying contractors and subcontractors in Iraq, and our motto was: 
We pay in cash; you bring a bag.

This payment happened to be a $2 million payment. We pay in cash, so 
bring a bag. He said it was just like the Wild West.

Question: Who is watching over all of this? Who is tracing it all? 
There is, I think, substantial evidence, with the release just 2 days 
ago of the Special Inspector General for Iraq, and another report, if 
you go through all of those reports, not just with Iraq, go through the 
reports on Katrina, and so many other similar examples, there is, I 
think, substantial evidence to lead one to conclude this is the 
greatest waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of this country.

Harry Truman, at a time when there was substantial concern about 
that, was able to get a select or special committee created here in the 
Congress, bipartisan; cost $15,000 to create, they saved $15 billion. 
Pretty successful. It ought to happen again. I am going to introduce 
legislation today, once again. We have voted on it several times 
previously. I propose that we once again create a Truman Committee, a 
bipartisan committee to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse, and on 
behalf of the American taxpayer say: This cannot continue. This has to 
stop.

I am going to make a longer presentation at some point, but I wanted 
to simply indicate that there is so much that needs to be done on this 
issue, and my hope is that at last, at long, long last, this Senate 
will adopt a select committee or a special committee similar to the 
Truman Committee.

If ever the American taxpayer deserved good Government, it is now, 
with something like this in which we can begin to unravel who got what 
and how we stop this from happening again.
