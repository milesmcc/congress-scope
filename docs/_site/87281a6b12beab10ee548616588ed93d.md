Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, a front page story in today's 
Washington Post reports that once again we are sending our troops into 
harm's way in Iraq ill equipped.

Madam Speaker, it is unconscionable that our Commander in Chief is 
resigned to send another 21,500 of America's brave sons and daughters 
into battle again not ''with the Army you want but with the Army you 
have.''

Although the Deputy Defense Secretary and Chief of Naval Operations 
told us in the Budget Committee last week that they will need another 
$5.5 billion just to fund the surge, apparently that is not enough to 
supply these troops with an adequate number of Humvees or training 
needed to achieve the mission.

Short-changing our heroes in the face of a relentless insurgency is 
unworthy of this Nation. If we cannot supply a surge, we must not 
escalate our presence.

Madam Speaker, let us resolve to make this year the year of 
transition out of Iraq that Americans have been waiting for. And let us 
make sure our policy never again falls short of measuring up to the 
valor and sacrifice of our troops.
