Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for 
his eloquence in his statement and his plea for Americans to come 
together as we move forward on the biggest issue that faces our country 
today, Iraq.

I appreciate the hard work he has put in, together with my staff and 
working with the Iraq Study Group, to come up with language that is 
included in the legislation.

I also thank the chairperson of the Environment and Public Committee, 
Senator Boxer, for arranging for us to spend some time this morning 
discussing our bill.

I yield the floor.
