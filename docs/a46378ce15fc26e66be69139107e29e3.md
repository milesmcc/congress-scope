`Mr. WOLF â€” 31 January 2007`

Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lewis for yielding.

I rise in opposition to the resolution. And let me just stipulate it 
probably has a lot of very good things in it. But when I was chairman 
of two different subcommittees, we always had complete consultation, 
and if what I am saying is not accurate, those Members should come down 
here and attack me for it, complete consultation before we sent the 
bills out. And what I am concerned about is the precedent that we are 
establishing.

I have a resolution to put the Congress on record in support of the 
Iraq Study Group. Now, am I going to be foreclosed from offering that 
resolution? Here is a group of men and women, Baker and Hamilton, who 
spent 8 months. It was one of these evil earmarks that you hear all 
about it. Am I going to be foreclosed from offering the Baker-Hamilton 
solution to the


problem? The administration doesn't like it. Probably Members on both 
sides of the aisle don't like it. But am I going to be foreclosed? Here 
is a group that spent 8 months looking at this. And Jim Baker is a good 
man and Lee Hamilton is a good man. They were bipartisan. Chuck Robb; 
Bill Perry; Leon Panetta, who served over here; and Ed Meese. Based on 
what we are seeing here now, I will be foreclosed. Any resolution that 
comes from this side of the aisle is automatically foreclosed. We have 
watched it for the whole month of January.

So let me just say I am sure, Mr. Obey, this is probably a lot of 
good stuff. But we on the minority side have to be treated the way we 
should be. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Now, the test will be with my resolution, and there are only two of 
us on it, Gilchrest and myself. Will I be foreclosed by the Rules 
Committee in 2 weeks from my resolution that puts the Congress on 
record in support of the Baker-Hamilton Commission? Ten people, five 
Republicans, five Democrats, spent more time looking at this issue of 
Iraq than this Congress has, than the Republican Party has and the 
Democratic Party has. And based on what is taking place so far today, I 
will be foreclosed.

And I hope I am not foreclosed because when you are in the minority 
and you don't have that opportunity to offer amendments, then, frankly, 
you are being cut out of the process.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.

This is a continuing resolution like no other that I have seen 
before. It is an omnibus appropriations bill that will fund nearly one-
half of the federal government for fiscal year 2007.

When I was Chairman of the Science, State, Justice Subcommittee, we 
had in-depth discussions and consultations with our Ranking and 
minority members. On our committee we worked in a bi-partisan manner. 
The precedent that this CR is setting troubles me.

I have a resolution supporting the recommendations of the recently 
released Iraq Study Group, also known as the Baker-Hamilton report.

Based on this CR process with its closed rule and no committee 
debate, does this mean that I am going to be foreclosed from offering 
the resolution?

The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has been quoted saying 
that most of the negotiations on the CR were conducted by staff. While 
we have terrific staff on both sides of the aisle, this is not the way 
this institution is supposed to operate.

The resolution before the House includes $31.2 billion for the State, 
Foreign Operations accounts.

This is an increase of $1 billion dollars over the Fiscal Year 2006 
level.

I am in no way criticizing the Gentlelady from New York, but I did 
not meet with the chairwoman of the subcommittee to discuss the CR. I 
know she is fair and reaches out across the aisle, and perhaps her 
hands were tied in this unfair process.

To be candid, there are some positive aspects of the State, Foreign 
Operations chapter. One is the full funding of the president's request 
for Global HIV/AIDS. This funding will provide life saving drugs to 
thousands of people infected with HIV/AIDS and will meet President 
Bush's goal of treating 2 million people, preventing 7 million new 
infections, and caring for 10 million people by 2009.

In addition, another $50 million is provided for the African Union's 
Mission in Sudan, and another $113 million for United Nations' 
international peacekeeping.

But, these funding increases had to result in decreases elsewhere. 
The president's 2007 Budget request included $3.2 billion for the 
Economic Support Fund, the continuing resolution cuts $746 million from 
the request, and is $148 million below the 2006 enacted level. A 
reduction of this magnitude will affect the Administration's ability to 
carry out critical foreign policy priorities, including democracy, 
infrastructure, and economic development programs in Iraq.

The president's 2007 Request included an increase of $709 million for 
stability and reconstruction programs in Iraq, these programs are 
essential to improving the safety of our troops in the country. Yet, 
the majority directed that there be no mention of funding for anything 
related to Iraq in the resolution.

This process is not the way the House's business should be conducted. 
I urge members to vote against this measure to make a statement about 
the way this entire process has been handled.
