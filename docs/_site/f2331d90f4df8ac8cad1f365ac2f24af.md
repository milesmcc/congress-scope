`Mr. KING of New York â€” 25 June 2007`

---


Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida 
for yielding, and thank him for the service he has rendered to this 
body in the 6 brief months he's been here. He is certainly following 
well in the tradition of his father, who is a long-time friend of mine.

Let me also say how gratifying it is to be on the floor and have the 
manager of this bill which pertains to Tony Blair being managed by the 
distinguished Ambassador Watson, who does such an outstanding job as 
cochair of the United States-United Kingdom Congressional Caucus.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of this resolution. 
I was especially privileged to introduce it because as Tony Blair exits 
from the Office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he takes with 
him the admiration and the best wishes of all freedom-loving people 
throughout the world.

No one certainly has been a closer ally to the United States than 
Prime Minister Tony Blair. No one personifies the close links between 
the United States and Great Britain than Tony Blair; certainly follows 
in the tradition of Winston Churchill, who did more than anyone until 
his time to cement that relationship, and Tony Blair has even advanced 
it more. Whether it was President Clinton or President Bush, Tony Blair 
always stood as our strongest ally in Bosnia, in Kosovo, in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and the international war against terrorism, and standing 
up for democratic principles and values.

And certainly as a New Yorker, I will always remember the fact that 
he was the first foreign leader to come to New York, to come to Ground 
Zero to meet with the firefighters and meet with the police officers 
and express the solidarity of the British people toward the people of 
New York, and of course, to the people of the United States, and to all 
peoples who were opposed to international terrorism. And then, as 
Ambassador Watson mentioned, the fact that he was here in the House 
Chamber on September 20, 2001 when President Bush addressed the 
American people also showed his absolute commitment to the United 
States and to the war against terrorism.

As an Irish American, I have been involved for many years in the 
quest for a peaceful solution to the struggle in Northern Ireland. And 
depending on which historian you're talking to or which analyst you're 
talking to, this is a struggle that went back 800 years, 300 years, 80 
years, 35 years. It really doesn't matter what timeline we're using, 
the reality is it was a seemingly unending struggle which was going to 
go on and on and on. And then the stars were properly aligned and Tony 
Blair became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Bertie Ahern 
became the Prime Minister of Ireland, and President Clinton committed 
himself to using the good offices of the United States as an honest 
broker to try to bring about a peaceful resolution in the north of 
Ireland. And through incredible hard work and perseverance and 
dedication, it worked. And not only did Tony Blair deal with Prime 
Minister Ahern and President Clinton, what he did even took more 
courage, and that was to reach out to historic enemies, if you will, of 
the British Government. He reached out to people such as Gerry Adams 
and Martin McGuiness and Sinn


Fein, and he brought them to the negotiating table and sat down with 
them and worked with them. And he had them to 10 Downing Street and he 
broke down centuries of division and hatred. And at the same time, he 
worked with those on the other side, strongly on the other side, not 
just David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party, but also Ian Paisley 
of the Democratic Unionist Party.

And the Good Friday Agreement would not have been possible in April 
of 1998 without Tony Blair, but also the Good Friday Agreement went on 
for almost 9 years afterwards until it was finally brought to its 
ultimate fruition earlier this month. And it was done because Tony 
Blair never yielded. There were so many times between April of 1998 and 
May or June of this year that that agreement could have fallen apart, 
that it could have splintered, that it could have shattered if Tony 
Blair was not willing to take that extra step, and he did that.

And during this entire time that he was bringing peace to Northern 
Ireland and standing with us as our strongest ally, also Britain itself 
was under attack. And as Mr. Bilirakis and Ambassador Watson mentioned, 
on July 7, 2005, when the London underground was attacked by terrorists 
causing large scale carnage and loss of life, and Tony Blair again 
stood strong and stood firm.

So, this is a moment where it's seldom that we see giants in history, 
and it's important, I think, that we not wait 50 years or 100 years or 
several centuries to acknowledge them, but to acknowledge them in their 
own time as being prophets with honor.

So I, again, say I've had the privilege a number of times of being 
with Tony Blair. I was with him with President Clinton in Washington 
and in Belfast and Armagh City in Northern Ireland, and just last 
month, again, at the British Embassy. He certainly is a man of stature, 
he's a man of achievement and he's a man of courage.

I am proud to support this resolution, and I urge its adoption.
