Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life 
and service of a young man who made the ultimate sacrifice for his 
country. Army Specialist Braden J. Long, 19, of Sherman, Texas, died in 
service to his country last year in Baghdad of injuries sustained when 
his Humveee came under grenade attack. Specialist Long was assigned to 
the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat 
Team, 1st Infantry Division; Fort Riley, Kansas.

Braden's mother, Melanie Thrasher, said that her son wanted to be in 
the military since grade school and reported for basic training just a 
month after graduating from Sherman High School in 2005. His family and 
many friends, as well as his fellow soldiers in the United States Army, 
can attest to the dedication of this young man who chose to live his 
life in service to his country.

Specialist Long's wife, Theresa, recalled that he was respectful to 
all and always kept his word. If he said he could do something, he did 
it. Long met his future wife while both were students at Sherman High 
School. They were married Nov. 4, 2005, and were living in Fort Riley, 
Kansas, at the time of his deployment to Iraq.

In addition to his wife, Specialist Long is survived by his parents, 
Melanie Thrasher of Sherman and William ''Bill'' Long III of Arlington; 
one brother, William Long IV of Sherman; one sister, Michaela Thrasher 
of Sherman; grandparents, William Long Jr. of Florida, and William 
Euans, Susan Long, and Shirley Dickinson, all of Ohio; and one great-
grandparent, William G. Long Sr.

Madam Speaker, words cannot express the gratitude we owe to those who 
have made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom; it is a debt that can 
never be repaid. I pray that his family will find comfort in knowing 
that America will never forget the tremendous sacrifice he made while 
defending our country. As we honor America's fallen heroes on Memorial 
Day, let us pay tribute to the life of this dedicated young patriot, 
Army Specialist Braden Long.
