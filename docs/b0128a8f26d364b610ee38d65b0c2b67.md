`Mr. REID â€” 28 February 2008`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of Senator 
McConnell, there will be a period of morning business for up to 1 hour, 
with the majority controlling the first half and the Republicans 
controlling the final half.

Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of 
the motion to proceed to S. 2634, a bill to require a report setting 
forth the global strategy of the United States to combat and defeat al-
Qaida and its affiliates.

Mr. President, procedurally, we are in a situation where we have 
asked to be able to legislate on a piece of legislation dealing with 
the President and those in his Cabinet sending to us reports on what is 
happening in the global war on terror. What has happened is what has 
happened now for more than a year, where the minority is not allowing 
us to go to that legislation.

We have a situation where we want to move to a piece of legislation. 
Procedurally, there has been in the Senate for many decades a provision 
that if we want to move to a piece of legislation and someone objects, 
the only thing we can do is file cloture on it. We did that. Cloture 
has been invoked. But now we are leading up to 30 hours. We had 30 
hours on the original matter calling for a timeline for changing the 
course of the war in Iraq, and that was 30 hours we used. Now we are 
going to do it on this legislation.

It is really too bad we are wasting time rather than getting to the 
legislation, but that is the way it is. And we, as a very slim 
majority, have come to accept that.
