`Mr. THORNBERRY â€” 25 February 2010`

Mr. THORNBERRY. I appreciate the gentleman from California yielding 
to me.

I think it is important to step back and put this bill in a bit of 
context. The Intelligence Committee reported H.R. 2701 out of committee 
on June 26, 2009, by a vote of 12-9 and the Rules Committee first 
reported a rule for its consideration here on the floor on July 8, 
2009. And yet, from July 8, 2009, until today there has not been time 
found on the floor to consider this measure. Now, we did find time to 
consider the Restore Our American Mustangs Act, we did find time to 
consider the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network Continuing 
Authorization Act, we found time to consider the Castle Nugent National 
Historic Site Establishment Act for St. Croix, all under a rule--none 
of these even included suspensions--but we couldn't find time to have 
the Intelligence authorization bill in support of the very people that 
the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from California are 
talking about who keep us safe.

What has happened over the past 7 months since this bill was reported 
out, as the gentleman from California mentioned, is that we have had a 
number of arrests and attempted attacks against our homeland; I count 
eight that have made the papers. Some of them we have stopped by the 
diligent work of our intelligence professionals. One of them at least 
was stopped by just pure luck. One of them was not stopped at all, and 
that was at Fort Hood, where a number of people tragically lost their 
lives.

In addition, in the last several months, the situation in Afghanistan 
has changed tremendously. We have had increased terrorist threats 
emanating from Yemen and Somalia and other places around the world. And 
yet for some reason intelligence was not a high enough priority, with 
the leadership of this House at least, to bring this Intelligence 
authorization bill to the floor.

In addition to that, I would say that a number of issues have been 
much discussed in the press and around the country that are very 
central to the efforts of those intelligence professionals to keep us 
safe. For example, the President said he was going to close Guantanamo 
Bay within 1 year; it hasn't happened. What's going to happen with 
those prisoners now? What happens if an American somehow joins a 
terrorist organization overseas? What are his rights and what are our 
responsibilities when we get into that situation?



Should there be a complete record of the briefings that were made to 
Congress about various antiterrorism matters or should those just be 
selectively leaked out as is happening now?

Another question: Should we automatically give the Miranda warning 
that says you have the right to remain silent when a non-U.S. person is 
obtained here in the United States?

Now, amendments on every one of these issues I've just mentioned were 
filed before the Rules Committee, and yet none of those amendments was 
made in order.

Why? We have these issues that are central to safeguarding the 
country. Yet the majority does not make those in order. What does it 
make in order? A number of reports, as we have discussed.

In addition, in the manager's amendment, there is a section that, I 
am afraid, illuminates for us all the approach that at least some 
people in this House are taking in this fight against terrorism. I do 
not believe it represents a number of the members of the Intelligence 
Committee, who see this every day; but in the manager's amendment are 
provisions that apply only to intelligence community professionals. The 
provisions say that they will go to jail for forcing one to do


something that is against one's individual religious beliefs.
