Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, on Friday, April 4, this Nation will 
observe the 40th anniversary of the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin 
Luther King,


Jr. Dr. King was a great American who fought injustice; not just social 
injustice, but economic injustice. His beliefs 40 years later have not 
been fulfilled. His dream is still alive, but not fulfilled.

In his time, he fought a war and was against a war in Asia that this 
country was fighting and losing, and costing us much in terms of human 
sacrifice, as well as financial sacrifice. We see that same situation 
today, as we have the cost in Iraq taking away from our cities and our 
people. He fought for working people who were working hard but not 
moving forward. Today, we see working people in the middle-class 
continuing to having their power eroded and taken away from them.

I ask each person in this House and each person in America to think 
of Dr. King this week and to think of Dr. King every day and keep his 
dream alive and move this country forward with economic and social 
justice, for we need it more now than ever.
