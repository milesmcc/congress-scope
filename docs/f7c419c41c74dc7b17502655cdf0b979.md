Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, the 34th President of the United 
States, Dwight Eisenhower, said that ''it is fitting and proper that we 
devote one day each year to pay special tribute to those whose 
constancy and courage constitute one of the bulwarks guarding the 
freedom of this nation and the peace of the free world.''

I agree, Madam Speaker, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this 
resolution.

Fifty-nine years ago we began the tradition of honoring the Armed 
Forces on the third Saturday of May as the national Armed Forces Day.

Before 1950 there were individual holidays in honor of each of the 
five branches of the military--Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and 
Coast Guard.

President Truman established this single holiday to honor the 
servicemembers of all branches as an act of unity after the Department 
of Defense was created.

There are several purposes for celebrating Armed Forces Day--
educating the public on the jobs and role of the military, exhibiting 
the military's state of the art equipment, and most importantly for 
acknowledging the people who serve our country in the Armed Forces.

Today 1.5 million people are on active duty in the U.S. military. In 
addition, 850,000 men and women serve in the seven reserve and guard 
divisions--Army National Guard, Army Reserve, Marine Forces Reserve, 
Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard 
Reserve.

These brave folks serve our country all over the world at 820 
different military installations.

About 140,000 servicemembers are stationed in Iraq and 56,000 are in 
Afghanistan.

This special day is celebrated every year with parades, military 
reenactments, air shows, and open houses at military bases.

The theme for this year's Armed Forces Day is ''United in Strength.''

United indeed, Madam Speaker. ''From this day to the ending of the 
world, we in it shall be remembered. We few, we happy few, we band of 
brothers; for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my 
brother.''

Shakespeare penned this quote in Henry V. It represents the unfailing 
commitment and spirit of unity a military member has with his fellow 
warriors.

I am a very proud cosponsor of this measure and urge all Americans to 
offer their thanks to our military members who boldly defend our 
democratic freedoms at home and abroad.

And that's just the way it is.
