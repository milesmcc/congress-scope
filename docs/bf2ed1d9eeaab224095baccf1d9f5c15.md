`Mr. HINCHEY â€” 28 June 2007`

Mr. HINCHEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and colleague, 
the chairman of this very important subcommittee, for yielding.

I am very interested in the amendments that Mr. Flake is presenting 
and have been all of the time that he has presented them over the 
course of the last several years. Mr. Flake seems to be devoting his 
attention towards trying to make sure that as much of the spending in 
these bills as possible is not being done in a wasteful way, that it is 
being done appropriately. And if that is the motivation, then I think 
all of us would certainly appreciate that motivation. But the effects 
of the amendments, I think, are questionable.

First of all, basically, under our Constitution and the provision of 
law, it is quite clear that every Member of this House has a 
fundamental responsibility, first of all, to represent the people in 
their congressional district. And most of these earmarks, probably all 
of them now under the Democratic leadership, which is much more open, 
are designed to do precisely that, make sure that these budgets address 
at least to some small degree the needs in each of those congressional 
districts.

But if Mr. Flake and others on the other side of the aisle are truly 
interested in trying to regulate spending and make sure that it is done 
properly, I would ask them to focus their attention on other things 
that really need to be looked at.

For example, this administration is still spending something in the 
neighborhood of $8 billion a month in Iraq. We have spent now almost 
half a trillion dollars there on that illegal, elicit war and 
continuing disastrous occupation. None of these amendments are focused 
on that.

Let me just mention a new report by the House Committee on Oversight 
and Government Reform, which concludes, among other things, that the 
Bush administration has put forth a shadow government of private 
companies working under Federal contracts that have exploded in size. 
Between the year 2000 and 2005, while the Republicans controlled both 
Houses of the Congress here, procurement spending increased by more 
than $175 billion, making Federal contracts the fastest-growing part of 
the Federal discretionary spending. These huge government contracts are 
done at the expense of the taxpayers. And in this report, it is made 
clear that Federal spending by one particular corporation, Halliburton, 
which, of course, we know is directly connected to Vice President 
Cheney, Federal spending to Halliburton increased more than 600 percent 
between 2000 and 2005.

Now, why aren't our friend on the other side of the aisle focusing 
their attention on this? We are. We are paying attention to it. We are 
trying to change the course of this government.

The Government Accountability Office recently found that the 
government has wasted at least $2.7 billion on Halliburton contracts 
which were overpriced contracts or had within them undocumented costs. 
$2.7 billion.

So while we are wasting all of this time on these little so-called 
earmarks where Members of the Congress are trying to do their job for 
the people they represent, people like Mr. Flake are ignoring things 
like $2.7 billion in overpayments and undocumented costs to companies 
like Halliburton. A record level of nearly 40 cents of every 
discretionary Federal dollar now goes to these private contractors.

Mr. Chairman, it is obvious we need a new concentration of attention.
