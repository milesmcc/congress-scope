Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today's votes on the Iraq supplemental 
with benchmarks and the Iraqi withdrawal bill are important steps as 
congressional Democrats do everything we can to reverse the President's 
disastrous Iraq policy.

I support the vote to withdraw troops because it is consistent with 
the comprehensive legislation I introduced, ''The New Direction in Iraq 
Act'' and the supplemental because it is a way to keep the pressure on 
the President. Support for the continued occupation of Iraq is fraying, 
as Republicans have started to say in private what the American people 
started realizing long ago.

I have opposed the war from the start, and these votes hasten the day 
when we bring the tragedy of the Iraq war to a close. I will continue 
to do everything in my power to end this tragic chapter in our history.
