`Mr. SPECTER â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had requested 10 minutes to speak on 
the judges, but I want to use a few moments here to talk about what is 
on the table.

We have just seen the Senate, for the better part of an hour, with a 
majority of the Senators on the floor, demonstrate gridlock and 
paralysis. I have an observation to make--and perhaps it would be an 
admonition or a warning--that the Senate is about to become irrelevant. 
We have, on the other side of the Rotunda, the House of Representatives 
taking up the issue of Iraq, which all Members here, with the speeches 
just made, agree is the most pressing issue facing the country, but the 
Senate can't address it. And the Senate can't address it because the 
majority leader has exercised his right under rule XV to fill the tree, 
which precludes any action by the Republicans, unless we Republicans 
exercise our right to withhold cloture.
