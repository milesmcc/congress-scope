`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 26 March 2007`

---


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Is that not interesting that the soldiers we talked 
to, Mr. Speaker, at Walter Reed, back home, the kids that have gone, 
come back, gone, come back, and they are going back again, the reason 
you hear about why these kids want to go back and you think why would 
you want to go back, they want to go back because their buddies are 
still there. They feel like if they go back that they will be able to 
save their lives.

The last couple of funerals I have been to with kids who were stop-
loss and were supposed to come home but ended up staying longer than 
they probably should have and ended up not making it back, the reason 
they wanted to go back in the first place was to protect their friends, 
and that is the heroism, that is the valor, that is the nobility of the 
cause. That is why these kids go back.

To talk about that the debate last week, and many of us did not get 
an opportunity to speak for a variety of different reasons, but to 
hear, Mr. Speaker, some people say that if we bring these kids home, 
somehow that is going to make us less safe here in the United States, 
is an appalling argument, that this administration and this Republican 
Congress would rubber stamp this war to go over there, and that 
National Intelligence Estimate has told us that this war has created 
more terrorists, not less. It has created terrorists, Mr. Speaker, and 
then now that we have thousands and thousands and thousands of more 
people gunning for us here, these folks have the audacity to tell us, 
Mr. Speaker, that somehow us bringing our kids home is going to make us 
less safe.

Now, that, to me, is appalling and to continue that kind of 
disjointed logic is unacceptable to me because we have kids in our 
districts who are not back home. They are either in Iraq, and many of 
them have gotten killed under the guise of the war, and to tell us that 
by bringing our kids home and getting them out of a civil war is going 
to make us less safe does not make any sense because all of the 
intelligence in the whole world is saying this war in Iraq has 
completed the final piece of the fanaticism of the Middle East.

We have given anyone who kind of wanted to join but did not really 
want to, they are now joining. They are now a part of everything. They 
are now a part of the terrorist groups. They are now a part of the 
terrorist organizations. They now hate the United States more than they 
ever have, and so I find the whole operation appalling.
