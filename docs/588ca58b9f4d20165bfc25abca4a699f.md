Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman.

Before yielding to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland, just to 
clarify on the issue of Status of Forces Agreement, Mr. Dent was kind 
enough to join the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, Ambassador 
Sumaydi, and me and other members of the Center Aisle Caucus for a 
dinner where the ambassador himself talked about the importance of a 
Status of Forces Agreement.

Will it end the war tomorrow? Absolutely not. Will it end it next 
week? No. Is it one good, reasonable idea that will lower the 
temperature in Iraq, that will reduce the animosities that are flaming 
out of control there? I believe it will. And I am appreciative that the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania has cosponsored a bipartisan resolution 
that asks the President to submit a Status of Forces Agreement to the 
Iraqi government, not conclude one because it has got to be negotiated, 
but at least submit one to send a signal and a message that we don't 
want to own the place; that we are there and we will leave when the 
Iraqi government wishes us to.

With that, I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland for his 
bipartisan leadership and his great measure of thoughtfulness on issues 
with respect to Iraq, and I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
Gilchrest).
