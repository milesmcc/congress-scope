`Mr. HAYES â€” 12 March 2007`

Mr. HAYES. If the gentleman will yield, you just returned from Iraq, 
literally landed moments ago. You visited Landstuhl. You were downtown 
in Fallujah and Ramadi. You were in Landstuhl this time, and you have 
been there before. I just realized that our Speaker tonight, the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps), is a wonderful medical 
professional in another life. So it points out again and again that 
care and desire to do the right thing medically, absolutely knows no 
boundaries here.

I remember being in Landstuhl on another trip with Speaker
Nancy 
Pelosi, and she was particularly intrigued by the facilities for 
premature babies there. So our wounded soldiers are critically 
important, their families, their children.

You spoke of Dr. Snyder, a Democrat from Arkansas, a doctor from 
Arkansas. Again, my purpose is to reassure people at home, no, we are 
not perfect, and yes, it was a serious, serious issue at Walter Reed 
and there are others, but we are willing, able and anxious and ready to 
deal with those issues.

Could you relate some of things you saw in your most recent visit to 
Landstuhl, which was this morning?
