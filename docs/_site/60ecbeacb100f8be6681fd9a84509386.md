Mr. COSTELLO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
6532, a bill to transfer money to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). As a 
co-sponsor of this legislation, I know how extremely important it is to 
our State and local communities to make much-needed road and bridge 
improvements.

In Illinois, if we do not fix the HTF before 2009, the State stands 
to lose over $370 million, delaying many construction projects and 
impacting over 13,000 construction and construction related jobs.

H.R. 6532 allows $8 billion to be transferred from the General Fund 
to the HTF to shore up the HTF. This is the same amount that was 
transferred to the General Fund in 1998 when the HTF was running a 
surplus. Now that the HTF is facing a shortfall in 2009 and beyond, we 
must restore this $8 billion in highway user fee revenues. By doing so, 
we provide sufficient balances to allow for the full guaranteed funding 
for the highway program in the U.S. which is critically needed.

Madam Speaker, we must ensure our State and local Governments get the 
money they are due in order to make infrastructure improvements. If it 
is a priority to build highway infrastructure in Iraq, it should be a 
priority here at home. Again, I strongly support H.R. 6532 and urge my 
colleagues to do the same.
