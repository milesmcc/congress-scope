`Mr. DURBIN â€” 3 April 2008`

---


Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier, when I was speaking to Senator 
Kennedy's resolution, I made reference to a New York Times article. It 
is an article from Tuesday, March 25. It tells in a very graphic way 
the correspondence of fallen soldiers and the circumstances they faced 
in Iraq before they died. As I mentioned before, I read this article in 
its entirety and was moved by it.

I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this New York 
Times article so my colleagues and others have an opportunity to read 
it as well.
