Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, I rarely address this Chamber for 1 minute, 
but I cannot remain silent over the fact that 79 Members of this 
Chamber refused to condemn the accusation of MoveOn.org that General 
Petraeus, who has given 3 years of his life in service to our country 
in Iraq, has betrayed us. He had a message of hope and a recommendation 
that we not leave Iraq too quickly.

Whether you agree with the general who commands our troops, he, and 
the troops he commands, deserve to know that all of us in Congress 
appreciate his service and will not be silent to such outrageous 
charges. MoveOn.org can say whatever it wants, but freedom of speech 
does not mean Congress must remain silent.
