Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of SSG 
Michael Lee Ruoff Jr., passed away on July 1, 2007, in Ta'meem, Iraq, 
in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Michael's wife, Tracy, and two daughters, Danielle and Grace were 
residing in Schweinfurt, Germany, where Michael's unit was stationed, 
and had planned to return to their home in Canon City when Michael 
returned from the war. Canon City is also the home of his parents, Mike 
and Vickie Ruoff.

Born in Ukiah, CA, Michael joined the Army at the age of 18, right 
out of high school, and was stationed at Fort Carson.

During his 13 years in the Army, Ruoff served in posts around the 
world as a crew member on M1 Abrams tanks. He was assigned to the 1st 
Battalion, 77th Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry 
Division, in Schweinfurt, Germany.

SSG Michael Ruoff's father was a Vietnam veteran, and like his 
father, Michael was a remarkable soldier, who could always be counted 
on.

Michael was a devoted man with deep beliefs, who, on July 1, 2007, 
made the most selfless sacrifice by giving his life to uphold the 
American ideals of freedom and democracy.

I present my humble gratitude to SSG Michael Lee Ruoff for his 
service to our country and offer my deepest heartfelt condolences to 
his family.
