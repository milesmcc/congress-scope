Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Back in March, the President made it 
clear we need a comprehensive approach to secure stability in 
Afghanistan. He stated that the safety of people around the world is at 
stake. I issued a statement in support. General McChrystal has 
requested more troops and resources in Afghanistan to do just that, but 
this administration continues to dither.

Several weeks ago, former Vice President Dick Cheney used the term 
''dithering'' to describe the President's indecision. I agreed with the 
former Vice President because ''dithering'' means to hesitate and waste 
time.

In the Los Angeles Times on Saturday, Doyle McManus highlighted that 
now some of the President's own supporters are beginning to wonder 
whether Cheney was right. For the sake of American families at home, 
Congress and the President should not dither, but listen to the 
commanders in the field.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
