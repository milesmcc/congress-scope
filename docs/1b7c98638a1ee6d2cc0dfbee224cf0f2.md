Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of Chairman Skelton's bill to bring American forces home from 
Iraq and to begin to end this tragic war, a war borne of lies, 
ignorance and arrogance. The cost of this war has been high to our 
country, to our economy but, most importantly, to our men and women in 
uniform, for they have taken all of the sacrifice for our President's 
decision to take this country to war in Iraq.

Our military responded honorably to the President's decision, but he 
failed to honor their sense of duty and their courage with a plan that 
was designed to succeed. His failed policy has cost their families, 
their communities, and most tragically, it has cost them their limbs 
and their lives.

The war in Iraq cannot be won, and it cannot be lost. It can only be 
brought to an end. The President continues to display both sheer 
arrogance and tragic ignorance as he refuses to change policy. Over and 
over again, it says the same thing, to stay the same course, to give 
them more time and that success is just around the corner.

The American people realize that staying the course in Iraq was not a 
plan, and it is not going to work. I have known, as many of my 
Democratic colleagues have, that staying the course is not acceptable. 
We honor our troops when we have the courage to bring them home and end 
this war.
