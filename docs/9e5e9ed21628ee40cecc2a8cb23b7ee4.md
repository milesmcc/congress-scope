Mr. BYRD. Yes. And the quicker we begin that debate and the quicker 
we begin to bring the change and alteration in policy, as he has spoken 
to on other occasions, the better it is going to be not only for those 
extraordinary, brave service men and women who have been fighting 
bravely and gallantly for over 4 years in Iraq, but we will begin to 
restore the prestige and influence of this country and the State he 
represents and loves. I thank the Senator for an excellent statement.
