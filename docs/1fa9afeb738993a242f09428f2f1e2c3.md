# IRAN COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007
## `1fa9afeb738993a242f09428f2f1e2c3`
`Ms. HARMAN â€” 25 September 2007`

Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, California is poised to join several other 
States in requiring its huge pension funds to disinvest in Iran. The 
decision is bipartisan. I commend my State's Democratic legislature and 
Republican Governor for this bold move.

So, H.R. 1400 too, is a bold bipartisan move, and I urge its passage. 
It tightens enforcement of U.S. sanctions, which are working; it 
conditions future nuclear cooperation with Russia on that country's 
ceasing its nuclear ties with Iran; and it designates Iran's 
Revolutionary Guards, who have long carried out terrorist acts in Iraq 
and the region, as a terror organization.

Mr. Speaker, Los Angeles, California, is home to over 800,000 Iranian 
Americans. In fact, it's called sometimes the ''Tehrangeles.'' I 
understand that, because we have such a large population. Our fight, 
however, is not with the ''Tehrangelenos,'' and it surely is not with 
the Iranian people either; but our fight, and we must continue it, is 
against the threats and the actions of the extreme regime in Iran who 
threaten our Democratic ally Israel and who threaten the entire world 
with the prospect of a nuclear bomb.

Coercive sanctions are working. H.R. 1400 will add new tools to those 
sanctions. This is the right way for this country to speak out and the 
right way for this country to achieve results.
