# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `5d34eabacbb680073c84413b1f244283`
`Mr. RAHALL â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, scripture tells us, ''David consulted with 
the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader.'' 
Throughout the war in Iraq, the President has failed to adequately 
consult with the American people and their Congress or other countries 
in the region whose best interests are also served by a stable Iraq. He 
has long recognized that staying the course in Iraq is not working, yet 
he stubbornly stays the course.

The Congress has a duty to make sure once sent into harm's way for 
good cause, our troops are equipped and supplied with everything 
necessary to accomplish a given mission. The Congress has an equal duty 
to change or end a given mission, when circumstances, realities and 
rationales demand it.

We in Congress want to work with him to bring our troops home from a 
more stable


Iraq. We should not only ensure that the people are given a full 
accounting of what the President is expecting of our troops in the 
coming months, and how much it will cost our Treasury, but we must also 
demand accounting of what the war in Iraq has cost the U.S., and our 
men and women in uniform, over the last four years.
