Mr. FEINGOLD. I am, of course, disappointed Republicans have again 
blocked us from debating and voting on legislation to end the war in 
Iraq. S. 1077 is the bill I introduced with the majority leader, Harry 
Reid, and eight other Senators earlier this year to safely redeploy 
troops from Iraq. The substitute amendment is the amendment we offered 
to the Defense authorization bill in September. It is, in effect, just 
a tweaked version of S. 1077. The majority leader joins me in these 
efforts.

There is simply no good reason to block a vote on this important 
bill. I assure my colleagues I am not going to go away, and this issue 
will not go away either, much as they might prefer it. Until Congress 
brings a halt to the President's open-ended, misguided war in Iraq, we 
will have debates and votes on this issue again and again and again.

I yield the floor.
