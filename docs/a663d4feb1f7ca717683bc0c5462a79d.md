Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Louisiana 
State University at Alexandria's celebration of the 65th anniversary of 
the founding of the 101st Airborne Division at Camp Claiborne, La., 
which was held on August 7, 2007.

Since its activation on August 16, 1942, this unit has answered the 
call of duty during many of our Nation's most dire military conflicts, 
fulfilling the prophecy of MG William C. Lee, who promised the first 
recruits the unit had a ''rendezvous with destiny.''

Perhaps the truth of this prediction was first realized during World 
War II, when the 101st Airborne Division led the way on D-Day in the 
night drop prior to the invasion. Later, during the Siege of Bastogne, 
BG Anthony McAuliffe and the Screaming Eagles fought on until the siege 
was lifted. For their heroic efforts in these missions and others 
during the Second World War, the division was awarded four campaign 
streamers and two Presidential Unit Citations.

The 101st triumphant role in our Nation's military history did not 
end there. In the mid-1960s, the 1st Brigade and support troops were 
deployed to the Republic of Vietnam, followed by the rest of the 
division in late 1967. In almost 7 years of combat in Vietnam, elements 
of the 101st participated in as many as 15 campaigns, further 
solidifying its reputation for military professionalism.

The 101st Airborne Division again brushed with destiny in January 
1991, this time in Iraq. During the deepest combat air assault into 
enemy territory in world history, the 101st emerged from 100 hours of 
fighting with no casualties, while also capturing thousands of enemy 
prisoners of wars.

In 1948, the 101st Airborne Division was reactivated as a training 
unit at Camp Breckinridge, Ky., and again in 1950. It was reactivated 
in 1954 at Fort Jackson, S.C. Two years later, in March 1956, the 101st 
was transferred to Fort Campbell, Ky., to be reorganized as a combat 
division.

In addition to its impressive history in combat, Fort Campbell 
soldiers have supported humanitarian relief efforts in Rwanda and 
Somalia as well as supplying peacekeepers to Haiti and Bosnia.

Today, the 101st Airborne Division stands as the Army's and the 
world's only air assault


division with unequaled strategic and tactical mobility.

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the 101st 
Airborne Division, currently based in Fort Campbell, Ky., as it 
continues its mission to support training, mobilization, and deployment 
of mission-ready forces who stand ready to defend and protect our 
Nation.
