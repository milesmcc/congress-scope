# PUBLIC LAND COMMUNITIES TRANSITION ACT OF 2008
## `89c20e48b556151e398164e450eb1cb5`
`Mr. BRADY of Texas â€” 4 June 2008`

Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons this Congress has 
the lowest approval ratings in poll history is it keeps playing 
political games instead of solving real problems like energy prices or 
supporting our troops in Iraq.

Today we are doing the same, playing games with our rural schools, 
with our rural counties, with our rural firefighters and police forces. 
Unfortunately, this bill is deader than a doornail, only because some 
political genius decided they would like to pit those of us who support 
rural schools against our energy companies. Well, guess what? Everyone 
loses, especially our rural communities who fought for this. This bill 
is a shame.
