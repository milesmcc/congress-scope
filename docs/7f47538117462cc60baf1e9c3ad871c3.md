Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say I have a great deal of 
respect for my friend from Arizona, but I have to respond by saying 
that another tax cut is not going to rebuild a broken bridge in 
Massachusetts that because of years of underfunding and years of a lack 
of commitment by the Federal Government is now dangerous. A tax 
giveaway to an oil company, another tax giveaway to an oil company is 
not going to build a school in California or Arizona or anywhere else, 
and another corporate tax break is not going to provide anybody health 
care.

The bottom line is that I will respectfully say to the gentleman that 
this Democratic Congress has been way more fiscally responsible, by 
light-years, than his party has been. Bill Clinton left office and left 
this country with a surplus. We now have the biggest debt in the 
history of this country. We have a war in Iraq that is $10 billion a 
month, and nobody on the other side believes that we have an obligation 
to pay for it. It goes on our credit card.

We cannot neglect the basic needs of this country, which we have been 
doing, unfortunately, for the last 8 years. We need to get back to 
basics.

I yield the gentleman 30 seconds.
