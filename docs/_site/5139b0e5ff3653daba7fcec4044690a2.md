Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Thank you, Congressman Hunter. Thank 
you for your leadership on behalf of our troops. And I appreciate that 
your son, Duncan, Jr., has served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Mr. Speaker, just today we received President Bush's report to 
Congress on progress in Iraq. I find it sad for American families that 
on the same day the House is considering legislation that sets 
arbitrary deadlines and timelines for retreat, the provisions of H.R. 
2956 mandate a hasty troop withdrawal starting within 120 days.

Additionally, the bill states that this withdrawal would be conducted 
in a safe and orderly way. Logistically, it would be impossible to 
remove our troops safely from Iraq in this short time line. Such rapid 
retreat would embolden the enemy, leaving American forces subject to 
ambushes, rockets and IED attacks.

As a 31-year veteran of the Army National Guard, and as a father of 
four sons in the military, my oldest an Iraq veteran, I especially 
understand the threats to our troops. In my seven visits to Iraq and 
three to Afghanistan, I've been continually inspired by the competence 
of our military leaders and the dedicated troops.

In today's edition of the Washington Post, the lead editorial makes 
the case against arbitrary withdrawal. It states, ''The generals who 
have devised a new strategy believe they are making faithful progress. 
Before Congress begins managing rotation schedules and ordering 
withdrawals, it should at least give those generals the months they ask 
for to see whether their strategy can offer some new hope.''

Additionally, al Qaeda has stated that Iraq is the central front in 
the global war on terrorism. And I believe to withdraw our troops 
before their mission is complete would invite future attacks at home. 
The Washington Post editorial states, ''Advocates of withdrawal would 
like to believe that Afghanistan is now a central front in the war on 
terror, but Iraq is not; believing that doesn't make sense.''

In conclusion, God bless our troops. We will never forget September 
the 11th.

I urge defeat of H.R. 2956.
