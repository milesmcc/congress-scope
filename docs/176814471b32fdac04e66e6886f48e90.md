Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, during the War of Independence, Paine said: 
''These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the 
sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from service of their 
country . . .''

America is again at war, and duty calls us to be more than sunshine 
patriots.

I have been to Iraq. My son is a Marine captain who has been in 
Fallujah.

We have heard on the Armed Services Committee from scores of 
witnesses, liberals and conservatives and everything in between, and no 
one has offered a plan that is better than what we are currently 
executing in Iraq, and everyone agrees that a rapid withdrawal of 
troops will result in civil war and a regional conflict.

If the Democrats have a better plan, let them offer it. Otherwise, 
let our troops get the job done.

It is politically popular to sound retreat and to play the sunshine 
patriot, but duty, honor, and country demand that America stand for 
freedom once again. We must accept nothing less.
