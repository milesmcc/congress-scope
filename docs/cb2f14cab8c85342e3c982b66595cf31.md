## `cb2f14cab8c85342e3c982b66595cf31`
`Mr. SPRATT â€” 12 March 2008`

Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I have sat here all afternoon, and last 
week through the markup, listening to this mantra about tax increases, 
all of which is a fabricated argument, and could not and cannot avoid 
the conclusion that to some extent this is a red herring.

It's a way of distracting attention from the real problems at hand, a 
way of avoiding discussion of a $236-billion surplus, which is where 
our economy and our budget stood in the year 2000, the year before Mr. 
Bush came to office, the $4 trillion in debt added by the Bush 
administration over the last 7 years, over median family income which 
has fallen under the Bush administration, avoiding discussion about a 
debt-burdened economy, which is losing steam near a recession and a 
dollar, a mighty dollar, which is plummeting, avoiding all of that so 
that we can talk about something that is not going to happen.

First of all, we made it as clear as we possibly could that we have 
endorsed, embraced and pledged to see continued the middle-income tax 
cuts which are included in the 2001-2003 tax cuts. They add up for the 
renewal over a 5-year period of time to $230 billion. If we follow our 
budget resolutions we have laid out, we will have a surplus in 2012 of 
$178 billion.

By 2018 the cumulative surfaces will be at $1.4 trillion. If we 
choose then, and we are not making the decision now, but if we choose 
then that will offset the extension of most of the taxes, most of the 
tax cuts that were adopted in 2001 and 2003.

We have put that in black and white, title V policy, policy on middle 
income tax relief, and we have laid out from item A through item H the 
different tax cuts that we support and are pledged or seeing renewed 
and extended. We can't make it any clearer than this.

Let me say something else for anybody listening wondering whether or 
not his taxes are about to shoot up and whether he should go cash in 
some stocks and bonds and get ready for this huge tax increase, it's 
not coming. Even if we adopted something that called for it to happen, 
it would have to go through Ways and Means. It would have to go through 
Senate Finance. It's a long way from ever being passed.

We simply say in our budget resolution, as we get ready for 2010, 
let's see if we can't have a conservative budget that will move us 
toward surplus so that some of that surplus, at least, can be used to 
offset some of these tax cuts. Let's see if we can't put some money 
into program integrity with the Internal Revenue Service and shrink the 
tax gap so we can use some of the money there, raise tax revenues 
without raising tax rates, use some of the money thus gained to offset 
some of these tax cuts when they come up for renewal.

Go through the code as we did in 1986, give it a good closet 
cleaning. It needs a scrub down as an accretion of the deductions and 
credits and exemptions and preferences, all of these things. If we 
muster our efforts, if we marshal our efforts, we can do and lay the 
basis for the renewal of many of these tax cuts in 2010.

But we primarily delayed the decision about those tax cuts in 2010 on 
the basis that we need to know more. What will be the state of the 
economy? Will we still be in two different theaters, Afghanistan and 
Iraq, fighting a war that is costing $12 billion a month? Will we still 
have an enormous deficit or will we be in surplus?

Better that we determine it than guess at it now. We are simply 
saying we would lay the basis. First of all, we would lay down the 
principle that we would protect these middle income tax cuts. Second, 
we will put the budget in place to begin generating surpluses so that 
they can afford the renewal of some of these tax cuts.

That can be done in this budget resolution. We are not pushing the 
biggest tax increase in American history. I don't know even where the 
numbers arrived from in the first place. I don't think it's 
supportable, but it is totally fantastic. It's an argument that is a 
complete red herring and a complete deviation from what we are all 
about today.

We should be talking about the savings rate in this country, about 
what deficits are doing to our economy, our country, and our standing 
in the world. There is plenty to talk about that is relevant. This 
subject is not because it's not about something that is about to 
happen.

Mr. Chairman, I now yield 3/1/2/ minutes to the gentleman from 
Vermont (Mr. Welch).
