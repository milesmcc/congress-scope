Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, ''such sums as may be necessary are hereby 
appropriated for livestock producers.''

Mr. Speaker, the so-called U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans' Health 
and Iraq Accountability Act contains this open-ended appropriation for 
pork, literally. The Troops Readiness bill contains another open-ended 
payment of taxpayer dollars for crop payments.

While the bill restricts funding for our troops, it would provide $25 
million in a bailout for spinach farmers, another $74 in taxpayer 
dollars for peanut storage, and $283 million for milk producers. All of 
this spending is designated under the bill as emergency wartime 
supplemental appropriations, language that means that the bill waives 
the budget so we can pay pork producers. It is ironic that this bill 
treats pork producers better than our troops.

It is no wonder that the majority will not be allowed amendments to 
this bill, because the American people would not approve the payment of 
pork spending under the name of our troops overseas.
