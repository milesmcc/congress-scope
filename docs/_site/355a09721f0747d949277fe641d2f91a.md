# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Mr. MACK. Madam Speaker. I rise today to express my strong support 
for our country's troops as they defend our freedoms and protect our 
national security.

Today we are debating a non-binding resolution that threatens to 
undermine the morale of the very troops who are at the tip of the spear 
defending our shores. This resolution does a disservice to the very 
troops some in this body are pledging to support by voting for this 
today.

President George W. Bush has proposed sending additional troops to 
Iraq to give those currently in the field the necessary manpower and 
resources to win the war. In addition, the President has put in place a 
new leadership team and a new strategy in Iraq.

While we all know that mistakes have been made in the war in Iraq, I 
am inclined to support the President's new plan. But make no mistake: 
there must be new benchmarks, clearly defined goals, and we need to see 
real results soon.

Some in this body are using this resolution today as a first step to 
defund the troops in the field. Madam Speaker, choking off the funding 
for American troops serving in harm's way will do nothing more than 
embolden our enemies and ensure defeat.

Throughout our nation's history, millions of men and women have 
served the United States in times of crisis and need in the armed 
services. These men and women--and the soldiers currently in the 
theater of combat--have made sacrifices that must not ever be 
forgotten.

Madam Speaker, instead of debating non-binding resolutions that 
threaten to undermine morale and embolden our enemies, we should be 
helping our troops by making sure they have the support and resources 
they need to defend our country by fighting our enemies overseas. Madam 
Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to reject this political gimmick and 
vote against this resolution.
