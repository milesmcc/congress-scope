Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for 
allowing me to speak and granting me the time right here in my 
schedule.

I rise today to reflect on the current emergency supplemental bill 
that is before us. I believe, as many do in this body, the current 
situation in Iraq is not sustainable but that it requires positive 
change, not defeatism. I think the worst thing we could do would be to 
give the terrorists of the world an opportunity to declare victory. In 
the long run, that would make it more difficult to assure Americans 
will be safe.

This bill includes conditions that do not support the commanders on 
the ground and sets artificial deadlines for troop withdrawal. I have 
consistently said we should give the President's plan time to work. 
There are signs it is.

I read today General McCaffrey's assessment. While not upbeat, he did 
find that ''the situation on the ground has clearly and measurably 
improved.'' He says we have ''little time left.'' I agree. But ''little 
time'' is not to set a deadline. Doing so changes the entire strategic 
picture. If you will forgive me some frivolity, it is the difference 
between the 2-minute warning and the ninth inning. We do not want to 
let the insurgents know they just have to let the clock run down. The 
insurgents might not be actually watching C-SPAN, but they do know what 
we do here, what we say here and can plan accordingly. This is not the 
time to micromanage the war from Washington and the Congress.

Outside this body, decisions have been made for a new direction in 
Iraq. The President has laid out his new strategy to the public. ADM 
William Fallon is in place as CENTCOM commander whose area of 
responsibility is Iraq. We have a new commander of our forces in Iraq, 
and that is GEN David Petraeus. Let me remind those who need to hear it 
that we sent him to Iraq by a vote of 81 to 0 to win, not to withdraw. 
Soon we will have a new diplomatic team on the ground in Baghdad as 
well.

This shift in strategies also includes something I believe is 
absolutely imperative to success: a real commitment from the Iraqi 
Prime Minister to get his Government to play a much stronger role in 
the destiny of Iraq. The President is confident we now have that 
commitment. I hope we can move on to more pressing issues in the Senate 
rather than repeating the same ones time and again.

One reason I do not support the withdrawal language is I believe it 
is based on an assumption that by leaving Iraq Americans will be safer. 
The terrorists have made it abundantly clear that Iraq is central to 
their war against the civilized world. They are committed to fighting 
there and will not stop unless we defeat them. If we have to fight, it 
is preferable not to fight on our own soil.

We are also facing a credible veto threat. This bill is going 
nowhere--at least nowhere beyond the President's desk, which means we 
are delaying the needed funds for our military. This is no surprise. 
The President has been very clear. When he has been this clear, he has 
not deviated from his described track that he will follow.

I hope we can get past this and move on to more pressing issues such 
as passing a bill that will provide our troops the money they need.

Finally, I will not support this bill because the last thing we need 
to do in Congress is hurt the morale or the mission of our men and 
women fighting in Iraq, especially when we have adopted the President's 
plan, which is a brandnew plan to succeed in Iraq. I believe it is the 
right course for our troops on the ground at this time.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
