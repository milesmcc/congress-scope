Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I just want to respond to my friend, the 
gentleman, Mr. Buyer. I agree. And I think most of us in this Congress 
would agree that we have to get our fiscal house in order. However, we 
put this bill together in a bipartisan way. And I again regret that Ms. 
Granger who worked so hard on this bill couldn't be here with us today. 
And I want to make it very clear that cutting funding for our diplomats 
who are serving our great Nation in very difficult parts of the world, 
whether it is Pakistan, Afghanistan, whether it is in Iraq, and I could 
go on and on, is irresponsible.

So I think it is fine to say that we have to put our house in order. 
However, I would like to remind you that in the past administration, 
diplomacy, development and defense were considered the three pillars of 
our national security. So just to say we can cut $1 billion here and $1 
billion there and not to have the consequences, have great impact on 
the security of our people who are fighting for our Nation, I think is 
irresponsible.

Again, I ask for a ''no'' vote on this amendment.

I yield back.
