Ms. SUTTON. I would just ask the gentlewoman from New Hampshire to 
add to that, because I know that you hear a great deal in your role as 
a member of the Armed Services Committee. That is a point that is 
important for people to know about one of the consequences of this 
continuing path that we are going down in Iraq.
