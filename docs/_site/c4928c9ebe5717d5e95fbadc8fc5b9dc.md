`Mr. KLEIN of Florida â€” 28 June 2007`

---


Mr. KLEIN of Florida. And Mr. Hodes, I would absolutely agree with 
you. And I think the proof is in the pudding back home. When I go back 
home and I speak to folks in town hall meetings in Palm Beach County 
and Broward County in south Florida where I live, I've heard from 
Democrats, Republicans and independents. And nobody wears their party 
on their sleeve, you just hear from them and they explain how they 
feel. And they feel very strongly that, as former military, there are a 
lot of senior citizen veterans in my area, they fought so hard for our 
country and the values and the strength that they have for the belief 
in the military and the strength that they have for the belief in our 
country and doing the right thing as we did in World War II and as 
we've done so many times since then. And they feel that what is going 
on right now is weakening the military, weakening America, as a 
standard bearer for truth and strength in the world, and this hurts. 
This hurts them, as people who fought so hard for our country.



I am not 70 years old. I am not 80 years old. But I have so many 
people that have expressed that to me as they wear their hats, as they 
wear their uniform, as they come and talk about their own personal 
experiences. We certainly have that generation.

Then we have the generation of parents whose kids may enlist or are 
already in the military. Some believe that what the military is doing 
is just right. Some feel very bad and feel like, not that their sons 
and daughters aren't doing the right thing on behalf of the country, 
they just feel like the strategy is not what they have made that 
representation, that commitment about.

I also feel like you do, that I am beginning to see, and I know in 
some of the committee hearings we have had in the House of 
Representatives we have heard expressions by both Democrats and 
Republicans. We are starting to hear from Republicans, too, about 
questions raised and looking for that accountability.

The bottom line is this: This is the Iraqis' war. This is the Iraqis' 
responsibility to take their own country and build it back up. That is 
their civilian ability, their ability to put the electricity back on, 
build hospitals and create jobs for themselves and put down the terror 
and the people that are harassing them in the cities and the explosives 
going on. They have got to take their own bull by the horns and do 
something about themselves. We can't do that. They have to do that. So 
there is this responsibility that they have to stand up to themselves 
and recognize.

We did what we said we were going to do. We took out Saddam Hussein 
and gave them a fresh opportunity. Saddam Hussein was a tyrant. He was 
a bad guy. But let's now look to the next level. The next 
responsibility is for the Iraqi people to stand up for themselves. We 
can't fight their war for them. We can't fight that for them. We have 
our own responsibilities.

We have to deal with Iran right now. Iran is a serious threat to 
Israel and our interests around the world, North Korea, obviously, and 
Afghanistan. These are places where the United States military needs to 
be able to be strong and exert itself when needed.
