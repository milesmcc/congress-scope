Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. If the gentleman would yield for a 
question, is it true that if we have soldiers in a war zone, whether it 
is Iraq or Afghanistan, if we have soldiers in a war zone, that they 
may actually be authorized to shoot an insurgent, but they have to go 
back to talk to lawyers in Washington in order to listen to them? Is 
that true?
