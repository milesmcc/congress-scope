# HOPING FOR LESS TALK AND MORE ACTION FROM WHITE HOUSE

`Mr. McNULTY â€” 23 January 2007`

Mr. McNULTY. Mr. Speaker, the President is going to come here tonight 
and by all indications he is going to call for a new era of 
cooperation. I hope that comes to pass. But that is not his record. On 
Iraq, he continues to ignore the American people, both parties in this 
Congress, and even his own generals. And our troops continue to suffer 
the consequences.

On energy policy, I have been in this chamber for the last several 
years when the President has spoken, I believe eloquently, about the 
need to develop alternative sources of energy. Then he gave huge 
multibillion-dollar tax cuts to the oil companies.

Health insurance is also a subject he is going to address tonight. In 
the words of former Governor Al Smith of New York, ''Let's look at the 
record.'' When this President took office, there were 39 million people 
uninsured in this country. Today that number is 47 million, up by 8 
million people. We're going in the wrong direction.

Mr. Speaker, I hope that in the year 2007, from the White House and 
from this administration, we get less talk and more action.
