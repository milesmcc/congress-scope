Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Private 
First Class Andrew Habsieger, who died serving our country in Iraq. On 
Easter Sunday, March 23, he was one of four soldiers killed by a 
roadside bomb in Baghdad. He was scheduled to return home to his family 
in 2 weeks. Andy was just 22 years old.

In Festus, Missouri, friends and family remembered him as a loving 
child and standout high school football player. Andy proudly served the 
U.S. Army as an infantryman and was inspired to fight for his country 
after the terrible attacks of September 11.

On March 22, 2005, Andy wrote me requesting assistance in joining the 
Marine Corps because of experiencing migraines while growing up. Andy 
ultimately joined the Army. Looking back on his letter, I am reminded 
of his steely determination to serve his country. That he did.

The weekend Andy died marked the 4,000th American soldier killed in 
Iraq. My heart goes out to Andy's parents, Michael and Brenda 
Habsieger, as well as his brother, Jacob, who is also in the Army. We 
must never forget our Nation's fallen heroes. PFC Andrew Habsieger will 
not be forgotten and his service will inspire generations yet to come.
