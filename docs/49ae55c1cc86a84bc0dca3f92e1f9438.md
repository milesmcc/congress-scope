Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the majority leader to 
reflect on what has happened this week: the routine motion in the 
Senate the motion to proceed--in other words, to start considering a 
measure--we have tried to do that three times this week.

Is it not true that the Republican minority has engineered efforts to 
stop a vote on changing the policy on the war in Iraq, has stopped a 
vote on having accountability in a report on the war on terrorism; and 
through the Chair I would ask, now with this measure has stopped an 
effort to try to bring some relief to the 2.2 million Americans 
from States all over who face foreclosure on their mortgages?


I would ask the majority leader, reflecting on what has happened this 
week, is this not a continuation of what we went through all last year 
when the Senate Republicans broke the record in the Senate with 62 
filibusters?
