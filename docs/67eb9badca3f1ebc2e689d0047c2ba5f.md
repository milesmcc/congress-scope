# RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE VIRGINIA NATIONAL GUARD ON THE
## `67eb9badca3f1ebc2e689d0047c2ba5f`
`Mr. WOLF â€” 25 March 2010`

---


Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions 
of the members of the Virginia-Maryland-District of Columbia National 
Guard on the occasion of the 66th anniversary of the Normandy Invasion 
and D-Day which will occur this June 6. I ask that my colleagues join 
me in recognizing the service and sacrifice of the members of this 
National Guard unit.

The Virginia-Maryland-District of Columbia National Guard unit was 
the only one from the United States to serve in the first wave of the 
Normandy Invasion on D-Day. Over 3,100 soldiers from this unit 
courageously served their country in Normandy, and there were 1,107 
casualties in the invasion.

The 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia National Guard joined the 
116th Infantry Regiment, also known as Virginia's ''Stonewall 
Brigade,'' and the 111th Field Artillery Battalion in the assault on 
the Nazis on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944. The Headquarters Company, 3rd 
Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment is still based in Winchester, 
Virginia, and continues to send its troops to serve their country in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. A new National Guard Armory opened last year in 
Frederick County and was named in honor of Staff Sgt. Craig W. Cherry 
and Sgt. Bobby E. Beasley, two local National Guardsmen who lost their 
lives in Afghanistan in 2004.

I submit for the Record the text of a joint resolution passed in the 
Virginia General Assembly in February, honoring this heroic unit of the 
National Guard:

 Whereas, June 6, 2010, is the 66th anniversary of the 


 Normandy Invasion, commonly known as D-Day; this epic and 


 decisive moment in World War II helped defeat Nazi rule in 


 Europe and was the most massive military operation in world 


 history; and



 Whereas, the only National Guard division of the United 


 States Army selected to participate in the initial assault on 


 the coast of France was the 29th Infantry Division of the 


 Virginia-Maryland-District of Columbia National Guard; this 


 division was assigned as its objective that beach sector 


 designated Omaha, which because of the fierce resistance 


 encountered there soon became known as ''Bloody Omaha''; and



 Whereas, Virginia's historic ''Stonewall Brigade,'' the 


 116th Infantry Regiment, was chosen to be in the first wave 


 at Omaha and, after a bloody battle on the beach, finally 


 succeeded in taking the high ground above it, and thus 


 secured a beachhead in France; when ''the Longest Day'' 


 ended, the courageous regiment of over 3,100 soldiers had 


 suffered 1,107 casualties; and



 Whereas, joining the 116th Infantry Regiment in the assault 


 was Virginia's 111th Field Artillery Battalion and other 


 smaller units from the Virginia National Guard, all elements 


 of the 29th Infantry Division. and



 Whereas, the Virginia communities represented in the D-Day 


 Invasion were:

 Whereas, many brave individuals participated in the 


 Normandy Invasion and all who worked so hard and fought so 


 valiantly are honored as heroes; and



 Whereas, General George C. Marshall, U.S. Army Chief of 


 Staff, helped plan the Allied invasion of France; he 


 graduated from the Virginia Military Institute as First 


 Captain of the Corps of Cadets in 1901; and



 Whereas, a former commander of the 29th Infantry Division, 


 Lieutenant General Leonard Gerow was promoted to command the 


 V Corps (Fifth Corps), made up of the 1st and 29th Infantry 


 Divisions, which were the first troops to land on Omaha 


 Beach; he was a native of Petersburg and a graduate of the 


 Virginia Military Institute, Class of 1911; and



 Whereas, on June 8, 1944, Technical Sergeant Frank D. 


 Peregory of Charlottesville's Company K, from the 116th 


 Infantry Regiment, single-handedly killed or captured over 25 


 enemy soldiers, earning the Congressional Medal of Honor, 


 only to be killed in action six days later; and



 Whereas, a graduate of The Citadel's Class of 1929 and a 


 teacher and coach at Staunton Military Academy, Major Thomas 


 D. Howie of Staunton's Company L, best known as ''the Major 


 of St Lo,'' was killed in action on July 17, 1944, while in 


 command of the 3rd Battalion, 116th Infantry, during its 


 final drive to capture the strategic city of Saint-Lo; and



 Whereas, commander of the 111th Field Artillery Battalion, 


 Lieutenant Colonel Thornton L. Mullins of Richmond, after his 


 unit lost all of its guns but one in the English Channel when 


 its landing craft were either swamped or destroyed by enemy 


 fire, was killed in action while leading a band of survivors 


 and destroying several enemy positions; he was awarded the 


 Distinguished Service Cross, the U.S. Army's second highest 


 award for valor; and



 Whereas, today, the 116th Infantry Regiment and other 


 Virginia National Guard units of soldiers and airmen maintain 


 a proud tradition with troops deployed in harm's way in the 


 War on Terrorism, such as the mobilization to Iraq of the 1st 


 Battalion, 116th Infantry on January 6, 2010, and two 


 deployments to Afghanistan of the 3rd Battalion, 116th 


 Infantry accompanied by several Embedded Transition Teams 


 drawn from across the Virginia Army Guard, including the 


 116th Infantry's Brigade Combat Team; and



 Whereas, since the start of the current wars in Afghanistan 


 and Iraq, nearly 10,000 men and women of the Virginia 


 National Guard have served in one or both conflicts,




 many on multiple tours, and a total of 13 members have died 


 on active duty protecting our liberties, and it is fitting we 


 honor and remember their service and sacrifices; and



 Whereas, the Commonwealth of Virginia and its citizens are 


 indebted to and thankful for the D-Day soldiers, their 


 successors in the ranks of the Virginia National Guard today, 


 and their families for their valiant service and enormous 


 sacrifice; now, therefore, be it



 Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, 


 That the General Assembly commend the 29th Infantry Division 


 of the Virginia-Maryland-District of Columbia National Guard 


 and the Virginia communities represented in the Normandy 


 Invasion on the 66th anniversary of D-Day that occurred on 


 June 6, 1944, honoring the brave troops who served there, 


 especially the soldiers of the Stonewall Brigade, 116th 


 Infantry Regiment who fought in the first wave of attack and 


 the 111th Field Artillery Battalion, both of which are a part 


 of the 29th Infantry Division; and, be it



 Resolved further, That the General Assembly acknowledge the 


 efforts of the Virginia National Guard to commemorate the 


 Normandy Invasion with a Day of Awareness to remind 


 Virginians of the sacrifices made to preserve their freedoms 


 by those who fought on D-Day and by the men and women of the 


 Virginia National Guard who continue to fight around the 


 world to protect liberty for their countrymen; and, be it



 Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates 


 prepare a copy of this resolution for presentation to Major 


 General Robert B. Newman, Jr., the Adjutant General of 


 Virginia, on behalf of the General Assembly in recognition of 


 the soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia-


 Maryland-District of Columbia National Guard and the Virginia 


 communities represented in the Normandy Invasion who fought 


 at Normandy and on into the heart of Germany to help bring 


 about the final victory over Nazi tyranny.
