# DEMOCRATS' MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 110TH CONGRESS
## `446dec594fd98b2aac1e032c76c3eaaf`
`Mr. PERLMUTTER â€” 27 March 2007`

---


Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, over the last 3 months, this new 
Democratic House has paved the way for a new direction in America.

During the first 100 hours, we passed legislation increasing the 
minimum


wage, giving the Federal Government the ability to negotiate cheaper 
prescription drug prices, making college more affordable by cutting 
interest rates in half on student loans, and fully implementing the 9/
11 Commission's recommendations.

We have provided valuable oversight of the Bush administration's 
failings at both the Justice Department and at Walter Reed Hospital. 
Had we not conducted oversight hearings of the horrendous conditions at 
Walter Reed, several incompetent administration officials would still 
be on the job.

Then, last week, we approved an emergency supplemental spending bill 
that provides critical funding for our soldiers and our veterans while 
holding the Iraqi Government accountable for taking control of Iraq.

And this week, we will pass a budget which is balanced within the 
next 5 years.

Mr. Speaker, the American people asked for a change and a new 
direction, and this Congress is delivering.
