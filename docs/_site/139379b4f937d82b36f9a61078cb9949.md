`Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in a time of war 
Americans and those risking their lives to protect freedom deserve 
leadership, not politics. As we continue to debate this nonbinding 
resolution today, we undermine the overall war on terror and the 
successes we have had since the attack.

In the battle for Iraq mistakes have been made, but the President put 
forth a plan for victory that understands those mistakes and sets 
benchmarks to ensure Iraqi involvement and success.

On the other side, they want to have it both ways. They say we 
support our troops, but at the same time they say we don't support the 
war you are fighting. Our troops deserve better. Either commit to their 
mission and bring them home victorious or stop their funding and bring 
them home in defeat. The choices are there in front of us.

Congress should allow time for the plan to take hold, not put forth a 
resolution that clearly is a step in the wrong direction, a policy of 
retreat and defeat.

Mr. Speaker, there is only one way out of Iraq, only one way out of 
this war, victory.
