`Mr. SESSIONS â€” 20 September 2007`

Mr. SESSIONS. The most dramatic reductions in violence occurred in 
the last months of August and September. Regardless of that, I would 
say the Senator is making a point I think I can agree to--that it is 
not just the number of troops that are affected. General Petraeus is 
executing a strategy utilizing counterinsurgency tactics that are more 
suited to the problems in Iraq and are proving to be more effective in 
reducing violence and protecting the civilian people in Iraq.
