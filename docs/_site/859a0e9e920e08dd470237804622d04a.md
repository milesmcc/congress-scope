`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 26 March 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Thank you so very much, Mr. Murphy. It is an 
honor to be here on the floor with you. I look forward to having a 
discussion not only with you, but also other Members of the House about 
what is coming up this week. I know that you alluded to last week's 
action that took place here on this floor. Democrats and Republicans 
and the majority were able to pass an emergency supplemental war bill 
that would not only put benchmarks in to make sure that the Iraqi 
Government is doing all that they should do to make sure that they 
carry out their responsibility since the U.S. taxpayer will be spending 
over $100 billion and counting over in Iraq in this piece of 
legislation, this supplemental, but also the $400-plus billion that 
have already been spent.

And also security for the troops, making sure that Department of 
Defense regulations, Mr. Speaker, that have been put forth to protect 
our troops, that they have what they need: the up-armor that they need, 
the training that they need, the equipment that they need, the personal 
equipment that they need.

And also making sure that our troops, as it relates to their rotation 
into theater, that they actually get an opportunity to have a Defense 
Department that has to do what they said they would do, and making sure 
they have enough time to be with their families, make sure they are 
able to maintain a job, those that are Reservists and National Guard 
men and women back home. And to also make sure that their families have 
an opportunity to be a part of their father or their mother's lives, or 
their parents having an opportunity to enjoy their son or daughter. And 
I think that is so very, very important as family values, and it is 
also standing by our word.

If we can't stand by our word while they are enlisted or federalized 
to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, then how do they expect for us to 
stand next to them and behind them when they are veterans and they are 
out in the world of veterans health care?

I can tell you also, Mr. Speaker, that I am very pleased with the 
fact that we did put something in the legislation that will hopefully 
point towards redeployment of our troops. This war will continue and 
continue and continue if left up to the President of the United States. 
But before I start talking about the action really that we took, 
passing that legislation, seeing the voice vote that took place in the 
Senate last week, moving on legislation even with a closer time line 
and different benchmarks, which, Mr. Speaker, you know we will come 
together in conference to talk about a little further and iron out and 
be able to get a work product to the President.

But as you know, today, March 26 of 2007, the number stands at 3,235 
U.S. servicemen and women that have died in Iraq; some 13,415 of U.S. 
troops have been injured and returned back to battle. You have to think 
about it, injured and then returned back to battle; 10,000 U.S. troops 
have been injured and have not been able to return back to battle.

Hearing those numbers and hearing how they continue to move up, Mr. 
Speaker, even speaks further to the kind of oversight that this 
Congress must have in this conflict in Iraq, this civil war in Iraq, I 
must add, that we are officiating.

We know that the President had a press conference after we took our 
action here on the floor. I want to commend the Members again who voted 
in the affirmative to make sure that we were able to take action, the 
first time the U.S. Congress has taken action with benchmarks, even 
against profiteering with U.S. contractors that are the third largest, 
you may call it coalition partner, or the second largest outside of 
U.S. servicemen and women in Iraq. You would assume that there are 
other countries in the world, since this is such a world issue that the 
United States is involved in, you would assume that there would be a 
number of countries before U.S. contractors, but U.S. contractors are 
the second largest number of individuals that are there.

Mr. Speaker, when I talk about these numbers and when we talked about 
the action last week, the President, then he sprung into action. He had 
a press conference talking about how the Congress is now holding 
dollars back from our men and women in theater and asking us to please 
stop. Well, I am glad that I lived long enough over the weekend to come 
back here to the floor, Mr. Speaker, to not only share with the 
President, but those that may think that by us standing up on behalf of 
veterans health care, by us making sure that Walter Reed Hospital gets 
the necessary dollars they need to be able to take on the influx of men 
and women coming back from theater that are injured of the 10,772 that 
cannot and will not go back to theater and the 13,415, when that number 
continues to increase, that when they get their care in the field and 
then they move on to Germany and they get even further care, and some 
of them have to come back here to Washington, D.C. to even get physical 
therapy and all the things that they need to get back to the theater, 
if that is stopping the dollars from getting to the troops, then I 
think that we need to go back to a civics lesson of what this is all 
about.

We are putting dollars in what the Republican majority did not put 
in. Anything that the President asked for, the Republican majority 
rubber-stamped it. As a matter of fact, the Republican majority in the 
last Congress


was so loyal to the President of the United States that whatever he 
said, whatever he wanted, they did it. And guess what, Mr. Speaker? I 
am here to report that that is one of the big reasons why we have a 
Democratic majority right now in the U.S. House of Representatives and 
in the Senate. Some 30-odd seats were lost living under that 
philosophy. And all of the hours that we spent on this floor, all of 
the hours that we spent in committee saying that if you give us the 
opportunity to lead, we will lead. Democrats, Republicans, Independents 
and some Americans who never voted before in their life went out and 
voted last November.

Now, the President can have a press conference, that's fine, he is 
the President of the United States. I can go out and have a press 
conference. The bottom line is let's not have the people of the United 
States of America feel that the U.S. House and the Senate are holding 
money back from the troops. As a matter of fact, we have given more 
than what the President called for as it relates to armor. We've given 
the troops more as it relates to troop safety and force protection. 
We've added three new brigades to the Marines. We've added 36,000 more 
soldiers to the Army to make sure we are at the readiness level. Under 
the Republican majority of the 109th and the 108th Congress, as this 
war started and continued to escalate to the numbers of where it is 
now, our readiness levels, and when I speak of readiness levels, Mr. 
Speaker, I speak of the fact that if we had to go into another 
conflict, we are not ready.



There is not a National Guard unit right now that is ready to go to 
battle. Now, what do we mean by readiness? Making sure that they have 
the equipment, making sure that they have enough personnel to be able 
to rise to the occasion, all the specialists that are needed, all the 
striker brigades that are needed. We have 100 of them, but we are not 
at the readiness level that we need to be, and we haven't been at this 
low level that we are now since the Vietnam war. I am not giving out 
any national secrets. Everyone knows that this is the case. So if we 
know the obvious, why not take care of it?

We are doing more than what the President has asked for. The 
President just has a problem. Do you know what the problem is? It is 
the fact that the Congress has said: Guess what, Mr. President. I know 
you have been saying a lot over the last 4 or 5 years of this war, now 
within its fifth year, the third escalation of troops that you have 
sent over to Iraq; and we pass a nonbinding resolution in the majority 
and Republicans voted for that, too, saying that we disagree with that 
philosophy. The American people are far beyond the President on this 
issue. So we are here to represent the American people.

The second point, when you look at this issue of the binding 
resolution, it says that if the Iraqi government does not meet the 
benchmarks set by who, the President of the United States, George W. 
Bush, then the redeployment of troops will start. The clock will start 
at that point for a redeployment of a number of troops within 6 months.

What else took place? The President said that it is important that we 
are not there forever. Well, still living under going in the old 
direction, the President wants the prerogative to be able to say, well, 
they are going to be there as long as they need to be there, and there 
is not necessarily a plan, and you haven't given an opportunity for the 
plan to work of the new escalation of troops.

Well, guess what? We saw plan one, and the violence did not go down. 
We sat here and watched plan two, and the violence did not subside. 
They weren't using Vice President Cheney's, the enemies are in the last 
throes of their insurgency, later to find out that that is not the 
truth.

So I guess we are just are supposed to continue to go on and on and 
on.

So, Mr. Murphy, I guess when we start looking at the benchmarks, that 
is the problem. Why doesn't the President say, that is my problem; I 
have a problem with the fact that the U.S. Congress is saying they no 
longer want to go with my original thoughts? There is nothing wrong 
with that. He is an American. He can say it.

But the bottom line is every last one of us sitting in these seats 
here in Congress and across the hall in the Senate, our obligation is 
to the individuals that have sent us here. Our constituents that have 
Federalized us here to make decisions on their behalf.

We are not generals. Some of us served in the military, some of us 
did not serve in the military, some of us never wore a uniform in our 
lives, but I can tell you this much. We have been sent here to watch 
over the U.S. taxpayer dollars, have the well-being of our U.S. troops 
that are allowing us to salute one flag, and to make sure that our 
number one obligation is to be loyal to the American people, and not 
one person.

So I speak very firmly and I stand very firmly on this point. Because 
I sat here the last 4 years in the minority not having an opportunity 
to be a part of the decisionmaking, not even being able to agenda a 
bill in committee or subcommittee, not able to bring a bill up here on 
the floor that the Republican majority did not allow me to. I mean, 
under the rules, they didn't allow me to. To now say, well, the 
President says that we are holding up dollars, emergency dollars for 
the war in Iraq?

Let me just share a few other things, and then possibly we can go 
into an exchange.

In the summer of 2005, there was a shortfall as it relates to 
veterans' health care, $2.7 billion.

In March of 2006, the President's budget cut funding by $6 billion 
over 5 years that was passed by a Republican-controlled Congress. And 
the first time, Mr. Murphy, that we had an opportunity to do anything, 
when I say the Democratic majority, the first action, and it was 
because of the inaction by the Republican Congress that did not pass 
the appropriations bills on time, that we passed a continuing 
resolution to keep this government running, and what did we do?

Well, we went into that bill and we made sure some of the special 
interest tax breaks and all of the things that the Republicans had in 
place, being loyal to individuals that had great influence in this 
House, and I am not talking about Members, I am talking about outside 
forces. We took $3.6 billion of the U.S. taxpayer dollars to increase 
the VA health care program and to make sure that their budget was in 
place so that our veterans would have somewhere that they can get care 
and their families.

That was our action. The President didn't ask for that. As a matter 
of fact, the President didn't even want it. But we did it because it 
was the right thing to do, and that was prior to the Walter Reed.

I keep saying that because that is so very, very important. People 
think that politicians and some folks do things just because somebody 
was looking or somebody said that you should do it or you are under 
some political pressure. That was a natural thing for the Democratic 
majority to do, and we did it.

And for the President to stand and say, well, you know, there is 
things in there that should not be in there and things that I didn't 
ask for. Well, guess what, we have to ask for it. I am even going to go 
down memory lane again.

January of 2003, the same administration, President Bush cuts 
veterans' health care for 164,000 veterans.

March of 2003, Republican budget cut $14 billion from veterans' 
health care, passed by the Congress, with 199 Democrats voting against 
it. That is House Concurrent Resolution 95, vote number 82.

March, 2004, Republican budget shortchanged veterans health care by 
$1.5 billion. It was passed by the Congress, 201 Democrats voting 
against it. That is House Concurrent Resolution 393, vote number 92.

March, 2005, President Bush's budget shortchanged veterans' health 
care by more than $2 billion for 2005 and cut veterans' health care by 
$14 billion over 5 years. That was passed with 201 Democrats voting 
against it. That is House Concurrent Resolution, vote number 88.

I think it is very important that we outline that.

Just like I said here earlier when I talked about the 2005 shortfall, 
after Democrats pressured the Bush administration and finally 
acknowledged that the 2006 shortfall for veterans' health care totaled 
$2.7 billion, Democrats fought all summer to make sure that


those dollars were placed back in the right direction as it relates to 
veterans' health care.

Also in March, 2006, President Bush's budget cut veterans' funding by 
$6 billion over 5 years, passed by the Republican-controlled Congress 
and, like I said, at $3.6 billion.

Mr. Speaker, we come to the floor and we mean business. We are not 
coming here to have a press conference and talk to some folks that may 
not quite understand exactly what is going on day to day in Congress. 
That is why we are here. We are here to make sure the American people 
know exactly what is going on here.


The reason why we speak very passionately about, you may say, well, 
it is Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq and, guess what, that other issue, Iraq. 
The reason we speak very passionately about that is that we have seen 
so much on this floor and so many words that Mr. Murphy talked about 
earlier, Members going on passing out inaccurate information every now 
and then, or the spirit of the information, whichever way you want to 
frame it, and to see the hard-core reality of these issues are still 
not addressed.

I had something here where all of the veteran groups, I must add 
here, Mr. Speaker, ''This much-needed funding increase will allow the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to better meet its needs for the men and 
women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as all veterans who 
have served in the past.'' That is from the National Commander of 
Disabled American Veterans. That press release was March 21, 2007. 
''The American Legion and its 2.8 million members applaud the Budget 
Committee for the budget resolution recommendation for $43.1 billion in 
discretionary funding for veterans. Your recommendations are close with 
the views that are estimated, that was estimated by the American Legion 
earlier this year.'' That is by the legislative director and the lead 
on the American Legion.

I think it is very, very important that Members understand that. 
Veteran groups are 110 percent, 110 percent, Mr. Speaker, about what 
this Democratic-controlled Congress is doing; and we are just getting 
started. This is Monday. We are talking about the things that we need 
to put in place to make sure that our men and women need to have what 
they need to have when they are in theater and when they are out of 
theater.

I challenge the President to think within his heart and within his 
mind that he would turn a new leaf, and making sure that when we send 
this emergency supplemental to his desk, if he vetoes it, it will be 
his action that will be delaying the dollars to go to our men and women 
in harm's way.

I have said once before last week, Mr. Speaker, I voted for two 
emergency supplementals, a lot that I did not agree with, but the last 
thing I wanted to do was to leave our men and women in harm's way 
without the necessary funding that they need. So if I, someone that has 
a different opinion than the President and the old Republican majority 
as it relates to this war in Iraq, we are all Americans first and, 
guess what, life is not perfect and everything is not going to come the 
way you want it to come when you want it to come.

There are other people in this democracy that have something to say 
about it, and I know there are Republicans in America that feel the way 
the way that we feel. I know that there are Independents in America 
that feel the way we feel, and I know that there are Democrats and 
those that are looking to vote in coming elections to be a part of this 
democracy.

So I come very proud of the work that has been done and the work that 
will continue to be done here in this House.
