Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Speaker, there is a statement that says: ''To believe that God 
will do everything while you do nothing is not faith but 
superstition.'' We have an opportunity to do something, not to wait for 
God to do it.

But let me start where I was. On May 21, I buried my dad, a veteran 
of the Korean War. He died at age 87. As I stood before that flag-
draped coffin, I thought about all the mothers and fathers, aunts and 
uncles, children, nieces and nephews who have buried their loved ones 
as a result of this Iraqi war--3,600. I don't want to go to another 
funeral, I have been to five. Not another deployment, I have been to 
three. Not another memorial, I have been to six.

I want our soldiers to come home as soon as possible. We have an 
opportunity to do a deployment that makes sense, that fits within all 
that we can do as Members of Congress. Members of Congress, step up to 
the plate. Don't be afraid. Vote in favor of this redeployment.
