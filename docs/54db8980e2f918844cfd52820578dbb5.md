Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia and 
would invite him to stay and continue this conversation with me this 
evening during this Special Order that is being hosted by the fiscally 
conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition.

Mr. Speaker, if you have any comments, questions or concerns for us, 
you can e-mail us at bluedog@mail.house.gov. Again, you can e-mail us 
at bluedog@mail.house.gov.

One of the new Members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog 
Coalition comes to us from the State of Pennsylvania, and that is 
Patrick Murphy, a veteran of the Iraq War who was very involved, as I 
mentioned at the beginning of the discussion this evening, in helping 
to carefully craft this resolution to demand accountability for how the 
tax money of the people of America is being spent in Iraq while 
continuing to remain steadfast in our support of our soldiers.

At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Patrick 
Murphy).
