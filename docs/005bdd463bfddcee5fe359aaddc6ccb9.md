Mr. KAGEN. I think that we are beginning to air out some of the smoke 
that has been filling up this chamber and some of the misinformation 
coming from the bully pulpit down the street. But I don't think that 
message of confusion is confusing anyone like Wendy and her 3-month-old 
baby Cassidy. Cassidy, the 3-month-old baby that she is holding, she 
doesn't understand health care. She doesn't think about having 
insurance. She is looking for her next meal. She is hoping that she has 
got someone there to support her, to help her out, to help lift her up 
through her early years, I am sure. And Wendy is working hard at $2.33 
an hour plus tips. She is working hard. She needs a little lift, a 
little help along the way.

But I know that people in Northeast Wisconsin, because I've asked 
them: Look, I'm working for you. I'm your hired hand. Here is your 
hard-earned tax money. Where do you want me to spend your money, here 
at home on your children to guarantee that they are healthy, that they 
can see their own doctor, their own physician in their doctor's office 
and not in the emergency room? Or, do you want your money to be spent 
overseas in the sands of Iraq?

I yield to Mr. Walz who has some data on what it is costing us per 
day.
