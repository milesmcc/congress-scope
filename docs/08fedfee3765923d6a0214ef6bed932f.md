Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the country is at war in Afghanistan. 
Now


there seems to be reevaluation and hesitation by the administration: Do 
we move forward with more energy and commitment to achieve total 
success? Do we pack up and abandon Afghanistan heeding the cries of the 
weak that demand peace, peace, any price for peace? Or do we hold the 
line preventing success or failure?

Our commander on the ground, General McChrystal, wants more troops to 
ensure American victory. Meanwhile, delays, deliberation, and 
indecision leave our troops prey to the Taliban.

Our troops are waiting for an answer; the Afghan people are waiting. 
Our enemy, the Taliban, is not waiting. They are encouraged by our 
inaction. They believe we will falter. They're on a determined mission 
to spread hate and terror throughout the region.

Indecision is a recipe for failure. We would do well to remember the 
words of President Kennedy when he said: ''Let every nation know that 
we will pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any 
friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success 
of liberty.''

America must stop the enemy of humanity.

And that's just the way it is.
