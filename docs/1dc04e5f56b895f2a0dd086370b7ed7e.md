Mr. GONZALEZ. Madam Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to welcome 
Lieutenant Colonel Paul L. Sherouse this morning as he opened the 
United States House of Representatives with a prayer as our guest 
chaplain. Lieutenant Colonel Sherouse is a decorated member of the 
United States Air Force and has been honored with the Meritorious 
Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Air Force Commendation 
Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, 
and the Air Force Achievement Medal.

He is the Wing Chaplain at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland and is 
endorsed by the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod.

Previously, Lieutenant Colonel Sherouse was on assignment in Baghdad, 
Iraq, in July 2003. As he prepares for his latest deployment to Kuwait 
on May 3, 2008, we wish him the best and are honored to have him here 
with us this morning. On behalf of my constituents in San Antonio and 
the U.S. House of Representatives, we thank him and his family, 
including his wife, Pamela, and their children, Arynne and Oliver, for 
his honorable service to our country.
