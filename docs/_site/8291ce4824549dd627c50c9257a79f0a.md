Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the distinguished 
colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, for his strong, clear, 
convincing, compelling statement to me. I am honored he has signed on 
as a cosponsor of this amendment I have offered, which is specifically 
related to the Iranian support, training, equipping of terrorists that 
go back into Iraq, are responsible for the death of Americans and 
Iraqis.

He stated the evidence very clearly. It is powerful evidence. This is 
an opportunity, as he said, no matter where you are on whether we ought 
to have a mandatory deadline or a goal or whatever about our policy in 
Iraq, to stand together and say, when American soldiers are being 
killed as the result of a concerted campaign by another government, 
acting through its agents, and our military--not some distant third 
party--but our military and our intelligence community are telling us 
that, clearly we are going to stand together here in the Senate and 
send a united message to Tehran: We know what you are doing. Stop it.

I thank the Senator from Arizona and Senator Kyl, who spoke before.

Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to add Senator 
Collins of Maine and Senator Sessions of Alabama as cosponsors of this 
amendment.
