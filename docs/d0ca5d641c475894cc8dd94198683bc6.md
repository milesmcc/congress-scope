`Mr. DREIER â€” 16 October 2007`

Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume 
to respond to the very distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules 
and say that the issue of corruption is one which we have taken on both 
in Iraq and in this Congress with great enthusiasm. And I would say to 
my friend that if she believes that somehow this nonbinding resolution, 
which does absolutely nothing, is going to somehow allow us to tackle 
the issue of corruption in Iraq with greater enthusiasm, that is 
preposterous, absolutely preposterous, Madam Speaker.

What we need to do is we need to have a fair, free-flowing debate 
that allows us to bring all of the facts forward. And that is what we 
have been attempting to do here; and, unfortunately, it just is not 
happening. Why? Because as my friend from Connecticut, a very 
thoughtful Member (Mr. Shays) has said, we are observing political 
posturing here, and I think it is a very sad day.

Let's take on the issue of corruption in this institution by 
defeating the previous question so we can bring forward real meaningful 
earmark reform, something that the new majority promised but not only 
has failed to deliver on but failed completely in getting us to even 
the standard we had in the last Congress. So vote ''no'' on the 
previous question and ''no'' on the rule.

With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
