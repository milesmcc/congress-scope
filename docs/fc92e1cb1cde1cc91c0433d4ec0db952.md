`Mr. REID â€” 14 March 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, following any time Senator McConnell and I 
will use, there will be 60 minutes of debate prior to a vote on the 
motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 9 
relating to Iraq policy. The time is equally divided and controlled 
between the leaders or their designees. The leaders will have the final 
20 minutes immediately prior to the vote, with the majority leader 
controlling the last 10 minutes.

I have had an ongoing discussion with the Republican leader about how 
we could or would proceed to the Iraq resolution following whatever 
happens this morning. In addition to Iraq, I mentioned a proposed 
agreement regarding the U.S. attorney legislation. I anticipate that 
agreement will be able to be reached soon, which would eliminate the 
necessity of a cloture vote on the motion to proceed on the 
legislation. If no agreement is reached, then once we dispose of the 
Iraq resolution, a cloture vote would occur automatically on the motion 
to proceed to the U.S. attorney legislation.

As the day progresses, I will have more to say about the schedule 
after conferring with the Republican leader.
