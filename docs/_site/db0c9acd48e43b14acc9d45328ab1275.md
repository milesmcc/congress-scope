# IRAQ RESOLUTION

`Mr. WARNER â€” 12 February 2007`

Mr. WARNER. We had in our discussions, and Senator Collins joined in 
this discussion--that we could not conceive--and that I, this Senator 
from Virginia, could ever participate in a cutoff-of-funding in regards 
to this situation in Iraq.

But back to historical precedents. I have this volume, the 
''Encyclopedia of the United States Congress,'' compiled by 20 eminent 
historians in 1995. And on this subject that the Senator addressed, 
they said the following:




 Another informal power of the Congress in the foreign 


 policy field is the passage of resolutions by the House or 


 the Senate, often called a sense-of-the-House or sense-of-


 the-Senate resolution. Although not legally enforceable, such 


 resolutions are often taken seriously by the President and 


 his foreign policy advisers because they are useful 


 indicators of underlying public concern about important 


 foreign policy questions. Moreover, as a general rule, the 


 White House wants to maintain cooperative relations with the 


 Congress and to give legislators the impression that their 


 views have been heard and have been taken into account in 


 policy formulation.


Clear documentation of the Senator's points in this very erudite 
resource of the history of the Congress. I thank the Senator.
