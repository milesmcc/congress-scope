`Mr. LEVIN â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend, and I don't view this at all as 
personal.

A matter of fact, we had this interim report on July 15. What did it 
come in and say? It came in and said, on the political side, nothing 
has happened in Iraq; and on the political side, we see no advances. 
But the political side is


where the advances have to take place. As a matter of fact, the 
President said, when he came up with this surge policy, that the 
purpose of the surge was to give the political leaders an opportunity 
to reach a political settlement.


Well, they have had that opportunity, they haven't done it, and the 
surge has not accomplished anything in the area of a political 
settlement.
