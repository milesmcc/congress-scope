Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. We are perceived with hostility because 
there has not been a standing up by our friends in Pakistan that we are 
working collaboratively in a diplomatic manner to enhance the quality 
of life and to provide for the security, if you will, of the Pakistan 
people, working with or with their military in the forefront.

So I would argue that we have much work to do in Afghanistan, our 
troops need to come home, and the technical assistance that is being 
given to the neighbor Pakistan must be defined as that and not defined 
as a hostile manner.

I'm looking forward to us clarifying the relationship and ensuring 
that the Pakistan intelligence is not undermining this diplomatic, 
civilian-focused effort of our military using training techniques and 
to be able to cooperate by allowing the Pakistani military to interact 
with our military for procedures and process. It is clear that we have 
a very contentious situation in the region; Pakistan, India, 
Bangladesh.
