Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Obey for yielding.

I have been against this war since day one, and I am outraged by the 
President's attempts to escalate it. I want this war to end now, and I 
want to bring our troops home immediately.

I mourn the loss of 3,228 Americans dead, and countless Iraqi 
civilians, and extend my deepest sympathies to the families. I repeat, 
I want this war to end, and I want to bring the troops home now.

Whether we like it or not, this bill before us is the first serious 
binding legislation to come before the House since the war began 4 
years ago. This bill contains benchmarks and time lines for withdrawing 
our troops.

Even so, in my opinion, this bill does not go far enough. I think it 
should prohibit U.S. military action in Iran without explicit 
congressional authorization. But without this bill, the alternative is 
not acceptable. A supplemental without benchmarks is stay the course.

I have received thousands of letters from my district in support and 
opposition to this bill. The only way to bring the troops home is to 
vote ''yes.'' I encourage my colleagues to do the same.
