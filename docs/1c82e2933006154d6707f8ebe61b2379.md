Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled and honored today to 
recognize the sacrifice of a fallen marine from my district, Lance 
Corporal Eric Levi Ward from Redmond, Washington, who was killed in 
Afghanistan on February 21.

Soon he will be buried at Arlington, the final resting place for 
those who so honorably sacrificed their lives for this country. When I 
talked to Eric's mom the other day, she said she understood her son's 
dedication to his country. She was a proud marine mom despite the 
sacrifice her family has made and the sense of loss and grief that they 
now bear.

It's important that we remember today that our country, the 
government, the people, our very way of life would not exist without 
those who sacrifice so willingly, who put on the uniform and sacrifice 
their lives, marines like Eric Ward, who gave their lives to honor our 
country to have freedom.

To Eric's family and to his friends, know that we will never forget 
Eric's sacrifice nor all those who have gone before him. His memory 
will live on, and we will continue to remember Eric's service to this 
country.
