`Mrs. McCASKILL â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about 
what has gone on in the Chamber in the last 24 hours and of name 
calling. I am proud to have worked extra hard the last 24 hours. It 
seems to me the symbolism of working extra hard and losing some sleep 
is an important symbolism.

Yes, yes, we all know we didn't have the votes to overturn the 
stubborn denial of this President as to the failure of his policy, but 
we showed the American people we are willing to work harder and try 
harder and stand up to the face of power for the right strategy to 
secure our Nation from terrorists and to support our military.

I am following to this microphone decades of experience in the 
Senate. I sat this morning and listened--and this afternoon--to Senator 
Byrd, Senator Specter, and Senator Biden. I was reflecting on the years 
of experience they represent in the Senate. I don't have those years of 
experience. I have mere months. But I am confused with the insistence 
of 60 votes on anything of substance we are facing in the Senate. I am 
confused at attempts to block ethics reform; to block taking Federal 
tax dollars away from big oil. I am confused at the effort to block 
reimportation of prescription drugs and to block negotiation for lower 
drug prices in Medicare Part D. I am confused about delays and stalling 
tactics to embrace the 9/11 recommendations on homeland security.


The majority should rule, and I am hopeful what we did over the last 
24 hours will have an impact on the way we work together to move 
forward on the problems that face America.

I also wish to briefly say that over the last 24 hours I have felt 
history, as I have reflected on other all-night filibusters throughout 
the history of this great body. I pinch myself when I open my drawer 
and I see the name of Harry Truman. When I sit at my desk and glance 
down and I see his name scrawled in the drawer of my desk on the Senate 
floor, it is amazing to me that I have the opportunity to sit in his 
Senate seat and to advocate for accountability in this war effort.

Senator Webb and I had worked on an amendment we were going to offer 
to the Defense authorization bill that I think Senator Truman would be 
proud of, because he got in his vehicle and drove miles and miles 
across this country during World War II, in a Democratic 
administration--as a Democratic freshman Senator under a Democratic 
President in a time of war--and he said we have to do better about how 
we are spending taxpayer money. We cannot allow war profiteers to 
tarnish the image of the men and women who are fighting for us in World 
War II. That was his view, and so the Truman Committee was born. Out of 
that committee, billions of dollars were saved, and America felt better 
about our ability to clean up our act, to oversee the efforts of our 
military in a way that is fiscally responsible and honors the service 
of our military.

Senator Webb and I, along with the other seven freshmen Democrats in 
the Senate, have fashioned a new, independent commission on war 
contracting, and we will now introduce this amendment as a stand-alone 
bill. I implore my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle to 
not play partisan games with this effort. This is an independent 
commission, fashioned in many ways not only after the Truman Committee 
but after the 9/11 Commission. It will look at war contracting in a 
thorough way.

Let us be honest. We are not going to turn back from contracting in a 
time of war. We will continue to contract. People need to understand 
now that we have more contractors on the ground in Iraq than we have 
military, with 180,000 contractors. I have had the opportunity over the 
last 6 months to see firsthand how we have failed in the stewardship of 
public money, with billions of dollars wasted, billions of dollars in 
unfair profits to private companies because we have not written the 
contracts well, we have not overseen the contracts, and we have not 
held them accountable.

This commission will allow us to take a thorough look at war 
contracting, and it will also expand the authority of the Special 
Inspector General on Gulf Reconstruction so we can look at not only 
reconstruction contracts but those support contracts for our troops. It 
is important we get this done because we can't go back, but we must go 
forward and make sure that in the spirit of Harry Truman, we never 
allow war profiteering to affect our ability to stand strong, as the 
strongest and most powerful Nation on the planet.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
