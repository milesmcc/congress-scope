Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate held two important 
votes: one on the Feingold amendment, which called for transitioning 
the mission; and on the Warner amendment, which would require the 
President to certify the Iraqi Government is meeting benchmarks in 
order to receive United States aid.

I supported the Feingold amendment, which provides a real change of 
direction and course out of the war. I opposed the Warner amendment 
because, after more than 4 years of war, 3,400 American deaths, almost 
30,000 wounded, and more than $500 billion--almost arriving at $1 
trillion dollars in taxpayer dollars spent--we need action, not more 
reports, especially those without consequences.

Yet, while I supported one vote and opposed the other, I am 
encouraged by both. They show real and growing momentum on both sides 
of the aisle to move away from this tragic, endless war. As the Los 
Angeles Times reported this morning:




 The votes illustrated Congress' dramatic response to public 


 dismay with the war.


As CNN's Dana Bash said:




 It was a milestone in the Iraq war debate. For the first 


 time, the vast majority of the President's fellow Republicans 


 voted to directly challenge his Iraq policy.


It is no wonder a broad bipartisan consensus for change is emerging. 
We are well into the fourth surge of U.S. forces since the start of the 
war, yet April was one of the deadliest months in the entire war, and 
attacks on our troops show no sign of decreasing. The Iraqi Government 
has failed to adopt an oil law, a law on de-Baathification, or any 
further constitutional amendments they are required to implement.

Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki is accused of sabotaging efforts of peace 
and stability by firing some of the top law enforcement officials for 
doing too good a job of combating violent Shiite militias.

Conditions are so chaotic, according to a report this morning by the 
Chatham House Research Institute--which is a respected institute in 
England--they say the Iraqi Government is:





. . . on the verge of becoming a failed state with 


 internecine fighting and a continual struggle for power 


 threatening the nation's very existence.


The U.S. mission grows further and further disconnected from our 
strategic national interests. Instead of focusing on force protection, 
hunting down al-Qaida and other terrorists, and training the Iraqi 
military--missions that will make us more secure, help the Iraqi 
people, and reduce our troops' exposure to sectarian violence--United 
States forces, as we speak, are patrolling Baghdad streets, extremely 
vulnerable to snipers, kidnappers, and these explosive devices which 
have become so well-known over there.

Our brave fighting forces have done everything we have asked of them, 
and even more. Every day we debate the war, our troops remain in harm's 
way. The overwhelming veto-proof bipartisan majority of the Senate is 
now on record saying the status quo is unacceptable.

With that reality as a backdrop, this morning we will vote for 
cloture on Senator Murray's sense-of-the-Senate resolution that will 
move us to conference on the emergency supplemental bill and the 
important negotiations that will take place in the near future on the 
Iraq situation.

Last evening, I spoke to the father of one of the hostages in Iraq. 
He lives in Reno, NV. We talked, and it was difficult. He loves his 
son, he prays for his son's return, as we all do. We talked about how 
we have hope that he is alive.

I urge all my colleagues to support the resolution we are going to 
vote on. We can all agree we need to move swiftly to the supplemental 
bill that fully funds our troops. We all agree we can't ''stay the 
course.'' That is not an option, as President Bush has done for more 
than 4 years.

As we move this debate to conference, the American people deserve to 
know that the Democrats' commitment to bring this war to a responsible 
end has never been stronger. If enough of our Republican colleagues 
decide to join with us, even the President will have to listen.

Mr. President, it is my understanding the parliamentary issue before 
this body is a vote that will occur at 10:30; is that right?
