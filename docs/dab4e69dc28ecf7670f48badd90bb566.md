Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.

I cannot believe what I just heard.

The gentleman just indicated that somehow we're adding $72 billion to 
a bill ''that has nothing whatsoever to do with the welfare of 
soldiers.'' I would point out by far the largest item that we are 
adding to this bill, $51 billion over 10 years, is devoted to help 
those very same soldiers so that the people who fought, when they come 
home, get treated the same way that the GIs did at the end of World War 
II. That isn't on the backs of the soldiers. That's trying to enhance 
their lives. It's trying to enable Reservists and Guard members and 
regular forces who have had their lives disrupted, who have gone to 
Iraq two and three times. We're trying to say, Okay, you can stay home 
for a while. Get yourself a college education.

The GI Bill paid back this country $7 for every dollar it cost.
