`Mr. REID â€” 31 January 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will be in a period for the transaction 
of morning business for 60 minutes. The first half is under the control 
of the Republicans, the second half under the control of Senator Wyden. 
Following morning business, we will resume H.R. 2, the minimum wage 
bill.

As I indicated in closing yesterday, we expect Senator Kyl to be here 
this morning when we resume the bill. I understand a number of 
conversations have taken place among Senators Baucus, Grassley, Kyl, 
and Kennedy regarding these amendments. It is anticipated once we are 
back on the bill there will be debate with respect to one or more of 
the Kyl amendments and that a vote in relation to an amendment could 
occur sometime around noon today.

Once we have completed action on all the amendments, then it is my 
hope that we can yield back all the time postcloture and then dispose 
of the substitute amendment. If we have to run the full 30 hours on the 
substitute, I think I am correct in stating that the 30 hours would 
expire at about 6:40 this evening, cloture having been invoked 
yesterday at about 12:40 p.m. Of course, once all that time has expired 
or been yielded back and the substitute has been disposed of, cloture 
on the bill would occur immediately and automatically.

Mr. President, just a couple of comments. When we complete the debate 
on minimum wage and the bill is completed, we move to Iraq, and that 
is, as we know, a very contentious issue. But as the distinguished 
Republican leader last night stated, we are trying to arrive at a point 
where we can have a good, strong debate. It will take cooperation, it 
will take compromise so we can be in a position to have this debate so 
all Senators can voice their opinion and, hopefully, we can settle on a 
finite number of pieces of legislation to vote on. That is my goal, and 
I hope we can do that. Certainly the American people deserve this 
debate.

Joint Resolutions.'')
