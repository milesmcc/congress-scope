# INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008--CONFERENCE
## `689cad41055330c4deaaa0a8771e3815`
`Mr. WHITEHOUSE â€” 13 February 2008`

---


Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today's debate goes to the heart of 
what our country is and what we wish it to be, by asking this: Will the 
United States of America condone torture? Is there, at America's heart, 
a heart of darkness? This authorization bill for America's intelligence 
community offers us the opportunity to answer that question decisively. 
It contains provisions for which I have fought from my initial 
amendment in committee, and which I am proud to support today, that 
would prohibit members of the intelligence community from using 
interrogation techniques beyond those authorized in the Army Field 
Manual.

By adopting this amendment, the two Intelligence Committees, 
Congress's experts on these matters, have sent a clear signal to 
America and to the world that in this country the rule of law is our 
strongest bulwark against those who would do us harm.

I hope that today the Senate will have the confidence in our values 
to reaffirm that signal and pass this legislation with the Army Field 
Manual provision included.

Over the past several months, the American people have become all too 
familiar with the issue of torture. I want to discuss one technique in 
particular today, waterboarding, or water torture, or the water cure, 
which dates back to the Spanish Inquisition of the 14th century.

Waterboarding was a favorite of torturers, because its terrible 
effects could be generated without the visible damage accompanying the 
rack, the screw, the iron, the whip, or the gouge. It could be done 
over and over.


In the 20th century, waterboarding was done in the Philippines, where 
colonizers wielded it against indigenous peoples. It has been used in 
Sri Lanka, in Tunisia, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia--we are in the 
tradition of Pol Pot--by the French in Algeria, by the Japanese in 
World War II, and by military dictatorships in Latin America. The 
technique ordinarily involves strapping a captive in a reclining 
position, heels above head, putting a cloth over his face and pouring 
water over the cloth to create the feeling of suffocation and drowning. 
It leaves no marks on the body, but it causes extreme physical and 
psychological suffering.

A French journalist, Henri Alleg, was subjected to this method of 
interrogation during the struggle for Algerian independence. He wrote 
in his 1958 book ''The Question'':




 I tried, by contracting my throat, to take in as little 


 water as possible and to resist suffocation by keeping air in 


 my lungs for as long as I could. But I couldn't hold on for 


 more than a few moments. I had the impression of drowning, 


 and a terrible agony, that of death itself, took possession 


 of me.


Waterboarding is associated with criminal, tyrant, and repressive 
regimes, with rulers who sought from their captives not information but 
propaganda, meant for broadcast to friends or enemies whether true or 
false. Regimes that employed the technique of waterboarding generally 
did not do so to obtain information; rather, to obtain compliance. But 
no matter the purpose or the reason, its use was and is indefensible.

Water torture was not unknown to Americans. A 1953 article in the New 
York Times quotes LTC William Harrison of the U.S. Air Force, who said 
he was ''tortured with the 'water treatment' by Communist North 
Koreans.'' In testimony before a U.S. military tribunal, CAPT Chase Jay 
Nielsen described being waterboarded by his Japanese captors following 
the 1942 Doolittle raid by U.S. aviators. From all this, America's 
military knew there was a chance our servicemen and servicewomen would 
be subjected to water torture.

The Defense Department established the SERE program--survive, evade, 
resist, and escape--to train select military personnel who are at high 
risk of capture by enemy forces or isolation within enemy territory. 
The program has also subjected certain service personnel to extreme 
interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, in an effort to 
prepare them for the worst--the possibility of capture and torture at 
the hands of a depraved or tyrannical enemy.

According to Malcolm Nance, a former master instructor and chief of 
training, at the U.S. Navy SERE school in San Diego:




 [O]ur training was designed to show how an evil 


 totalitarian enemy would use torture at the slightest whim.


Those who have experienced this technique, even at the hands of their 
own brothers in arms, are unequivocal about its effect. Former Deputy 
Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who underwent waterboarding during 
SERE training, said this:







 As a human being, fear and helplessness are pretty 


 overwhelming. . . . this is not a discussion that Americans 


 should even be having. It is torture.


Our colleague in this body, Senator John McCain, has said the same. 
Yet it was to this relic of the dungeons of the inquisition, of the 
Cambodian killing fields, and of the huntas of the Southern Hemisphere 
that the Bush administration turned for guidance. I will speak later 
about how our Department of Justice came to approve this. But for now, 
we know that last week, in a stunning public admission, the CIA 
Director General, Michael Hayden, admitted the United States 
waterboarded three detainees following the September 11 attacks. The 
virus of waterboarding had traveled from tyrant regimes, through the 
SERE program, and infected America's body politic.

Retired BG David Irvin, of the U.S. Army Reserve, a former 
intelligence officer and instructor in interrogation, and Joe Navarro, 
interrogator with the FBI, recently wrote:




 [T]here is considerable evidence that the CIA had to 


 scramble after 9/11 to develop an interrogation program and 


 turned to individuals with no professional experience in the 


 field. . . . Given the crisis atmosphere of the day, it is 


 all too easy to believe the comment of an intelligence 


 insider who said of the secret program to detain and 


 interrogate al Qaeda suspects that ''quality control went out 


 the window.''


Don't let us jump out the window after it.

America's military is expressly prohibited from using torture because 
intelligence experts in our Armed Forces know torture is an ineffective 
method of obtaining actionable intelligence. Again, I will speak later 
about the false assertion that this program was designed for 18-year-
old novices. Some of the most sophisticated intelligence interrogations 
are done by our military after intense training. Our military adheres 
to the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations. At 
a hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which 
I serve, I asked COL Steven Kleinman, a 22-year veteran of 
interrogations, a senior intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force 
Reserves, and a veteran interrogator with plenty of experience overseas 
in the Middle East, about his experience conducting interrogations 
using the Army Field Manual.

He said:




 I am not at all limited by the Army Field Manual in terms 


 of what I need to do to generate useful information. . . . 


 I've never felt any necessity or operational requirement to 


 bring physical, psychological or emotional pressure on a 


 source to win their cooperation.


A significant number of retired military leaders have written to the 
chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee saying:




 interrogation methods authorized by the field manual have 


 proven effective in eliciting vital intelligence from 


 dangerous enemy prisoners. . . . And the principles reflected 


 in the Field Manual are values that no U.S. agency should 


 violate.


And GEN David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces serving in Iraq, 
reiterated this point when he wrote last year to every soldier serving 
in the Iraq theater:




 Some may argue that we would be more effective if we 


 sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain 


 information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the 


 basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that 


 they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. . . . 


 our experience in applying the interrogation standards 


 laid out in the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence 


 Collector Operations that was published last year shows 


 that the techniques in the manual work effectively and 


 humanely in eliciting information from detainees.


The cochairs of the 9/11 Commission emphatically agree. On Monday, 
the chairmen, together with two former Secretaries of State, three 
former National Security Advisors, and other national security experts, 
wrote that ''[c]ruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners 
under American control makes us less safe, violates our national 
values, and damages America's reputation in the world.''

Torture is ineffective. It is wrong. It is dangerous to all those who 
serve the United States of America in harm's way. It should never, ever 
be used by any person who represents the United States of America or 
any agency that flies the American flag.

I was proud last July to introduce an amendment in the Intelligence 
Committee that would write this rule into law. When that effort did not 
succeed, I was proud again last winter to support Senator Feinstein's 
amendment in conference.

I call on all my colleagues to support this legislation. We can 
journey no longer down Winston Churchill's stairway which leads to a 
dark gulf. As Winston Churchill said:




 It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a 


 bit, the carpet ends. A little farther on, there are only 


 flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath 


 your feet.


The United States of America--the city on a hill, the light of the 
world, the promise of generations--must not ever condone torture. 
Torture breaks that promise. Torture extinguishes that light. Torture 
darkens that city. I hope by our actions today, we in the Senate will 
help turn this country back toward our centuries-old promise. I hope we 
will turn toward the light.

I yield the floor.
