Mr. REID. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate stand in recess until 1:45 p.m. today. We have the leaders of 
Afghanistan and Pakistan here today. They are important meetings. We 
have a number of things, and it would be better if we are not in 
session. I appreciate everyone allowing this consent to go forward.
