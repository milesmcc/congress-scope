`Mr. HOEKSTRA â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. HOEKSTRA. When would it be appropriate to ask for unanimous 
consent to correct this oversight in this resolution that only 
addresses support for our armed services, but as the ranking member of 
the Intelligence Committee, I feel that it does a great injustice to 
the hundreds of people in the intelligence community who are not 
recognized for their service in Iraq?
