Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of America's 
bravest, Lance Corporal Irvin Ceniceros of Clarksville, Arkansas, who 
was taken from us while supporting combat missions in Afghanistan.

After graduating high school in 2007, Lance Corporal Ceniceros 
enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. Family members say it was the 
strength and character of the Marines that drew him to serve with the 
Corps, and his friends and comrades say he was a great machine gunner.

Lance Corporal Ceniceros served with the Marines all across the 
globe, and less than 2 weeks after arriving in Afghanistan, at the age 
of 21, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our great Nation.

My prayers and the prayers of the people of Arkansas are with the 
Ceniceros family. I humbly offer my thanks to Lance Corporal Irvin 
Ceniceros, a true American hero, for his selfless service to the 
security and well-being of all Americans.
