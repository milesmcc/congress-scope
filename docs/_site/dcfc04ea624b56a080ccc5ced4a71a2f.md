Mr. PAYNE. I appreciated having the opportunity to control the time 
in the past several hours, and perhaps might request from the chairman 
perhaps an additional 2 minutes as I respond and wrap up.

Mr. Speaker, let me say that I listened with great interest to the 
George Washington story, and there is no question that there were tough 
times. But George Washington had some pretty intelligent advisers. You 
know, the people who signed the Declaration of Independence, he had 
people like Adams and Washington. You had people like Crispus Attucks, 
the first person to die in the Revolutionary War and in the Boston 
Massacre on May 4, 1770.

You had people who participated in the Boston Tea Party because they 
said taxation without representation is tyranny. It was Christmas Eve 
in Pennsylvania when George Washington came across the Delaware and 
attacked the Hessian soldiers on Christmas Eve because they were 
unaware that this attack was coming. George Washington came from New 
Jersey, Morristown, Newark, and went on through and did have a victory.

But let me say the difference, when George Washington was fighting, 
there was a clear and present issue. We were fighting for independence. 
We knew exactly what it was. We were being held bondage by the British, 
that Union Jack.

But what do we have here? We have, following 9/11, support from 
practically every country in the world. But then we went on and Osama 
bin Laden said he did the bombing, he took credit for it, the World 
Trade Center, the Pentagon and the final plane that was brought down on 
the way to the Capitol and the White House.

Then we said that we were going into Iraq. First of all, it was 
because there were weapons of mass destruction. Then it was the fact 
that we had to have a regime change. At one point we talked about we 
had to remove Saddam Hussein.

We kept looking for reasons, and that is a big difference. We had the 
preemptive strike, and then we tried to come up with the reason that we 
were doing it, and it continued to change, one reason after another.

There is a great sense of sadness among those of us who foresaw over 
4 years ago the tragedy that is now unfolding in Iraq. On October 8 and 
9, 2002, I stood right here in this very well at the House of 
Representatives, and I managed the time those 2 days in opposition to 
the preemptive first strike for Iraq. It was in the 107th Congress, and 
now we are in the 110th Congress, and the war that we assumed would be 
swift and certain now continues to rage.

I am looking over the remarks I made at that time. It saddens me that 
the argument of those of us who oppose the war fell on deaf ears. At 
that time, I stated that a unilateral first strike would undermine the 
moral authority of the United States of America. I stated that results 
of substantial losses of life will occur, that there will be a 
destabilization of the Middle East region and undermine the ability of 
our Nation to address unmet domestic priorities.

It saddens me beyond words that 3,122 Americans had to sacrifice 
their lives and over 23,000 have been wounded for a war that did not 
have to be fought. Included in this number are 50 fatalities from my 
home State of New Jersey and 366 wounded. Estimates are up towards 
100,000 Iraqi men, women and children have been killed.

After the administration has been proven wrong on every prediction 
from the length of the war to weapons of mass destruction to the 
strength of the insurgency, we are now being asked to trust their 
judgment on a new strategy, which would put 20,000 more American lives 
on the line. This plan will not provide lasting security for Iraqis. It 
is not what the American people have asked for in November.


Haven't we learned anything from our mistakes yet?

Recent so-called short-term troop surges in Iraq have not stopped the 
violence from getting worse. There is nothing to suggest that this time 
will be any different.

For example, we had Operation Together Forward from June to October 
2006. In June, the Bush administration announced a new plan for 
securing Baghdad by increasing the presence of Iraqi security forces. 
That plan failed, so in July, the White House announced that additional 
American troops would be sent into Baghdad.

By October, a U.S. military spokesman, General William Caldwell, 
acknowledged that the operation and troop Increases was a failure and 
had not met our overall expectations of sustaining a reduction in the 
level of violence. Regardless of how the administration intends to 
increase the troops in Iraq, the result will be the same.

There is additional strain on our military personnel and their 
families, and personal lives will be upset by unexpectedly early 
deployments of family members or unexpected delays in their homecoming. 
This is an additional burden to our military families that they should 
not have to bear.

By extending operations, we undertake a strategic risk. Our ability 
to meet potential future challenges is strained under the current 
operational demands. Increasing these demands only increase the risk to 
our future capacity.

I had the privilege of serving in the past as a congressional 
delegate to the United Nations. I strongly believe in the power of 
democracy. If we had allowed the United Nations inspectors to complete 
their work before the war instead of suddenly ordering them out of 
Iraq, I believe things would have turned out much differently. Instead, 
the administration proceeded full speed ahead towards war, as they 
disseminated faulty intelligence and relied on scare tactics to garner 
support.

I believe the time has come to begin an orderly withdrawal of 
American forces from Iraq. This approach would send a message to the 
Iraqis that they must take more responsibility for their own security 
and would reduce the strain on the American military.

The administration should listen to the Baker-Hamilton commission, 
which has offered a stinging assessment of virtually every aspect of 
the U.S. venture in Iraq and called for a reshaping of the American 
presence and a new Middle East diplomacy initiative to prevent the 
country from sliding into anarchy.

I conclude by saying I have heard my colleagues on the other side 
warn about Iraq falling into chaos and dangers of the United States 
losing our standing in the world. Sadly, Iraq already is in total 
chaos, and, unfortunately, the United States, a country we all love, 
has suffered much loss and prestige around the world.

In the debate before the war those of us who predicted the outcome 
did not prevail. I pledge with my colleagues to listen this time to 
vote against escalation of the war and support this resolution.
