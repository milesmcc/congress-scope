`Mrs. JONES of Ohio â€” 18 December 2007`

---


Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 1st Samuel, chapter 20, verse 18, 
reads as follows: ''Then Jonathan said to David, tomorrow is the New 
Moon Festival. You will be missed because your seat will be empty.''

Tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Indiana delegation 
pause to celebrate the life of a great woman whose seat now stands 
empty here in the House of Representatives, Congresswoman Julia Carson.

Congresswoman Carson passed away this past Saturday after a long bout 
with lung cancer. And while her seat is empty, her spirit lives on in 
our hearts. She was unique. She often reminded me of the elders in my 
family. They are


strong in their convictions and don't pull any punches when making 
their point; yet they have a witty and humorous way about them that can 
disarm even their most ardent opponent. That was Congresswoman Julia 
Carson.

Even though she was in her last illness, she did not let that stop 
her from advocating on behalf of her constituents. And she never 
complained. She always greeted you with a warm smile and that 
unmistakable humor which always made you feel good.

She was a trailblazer, born in poverty and racial segregation to a 
teenage single mother. She came through the political ranks to become 
the first African American and woman elected to Congress from 
Indianapolis. A strong advocate for her constituents, she was not 
afraid to take a stand, be it popular or unpopular.

Madam Speaker, I will include for the Record an article that was in 
today's Roll Call that was written by her predecessor Andy Jacobs as a 
guest observer and was entitled ''Remembering Congress' Jewel Named 
Julia.'' It is a wonderful article. I won't go through it because we 
have a lot of people here who want to speak about their remembrances of 
our wonderful colleague Julia Carson.

Remembering Congress' Jewel Named Julia













 (By Andy Jacobs, Jr.)




 ''Look where he came from and look where he went; and 


 wasn't he a kind of tough struggler all his life right up to 


 the finish?'' The words are those of Carl Sandburg in praise 


 of Abraham Lincoln. The same praise could and should be said 


 of our sister, the late Rep. Julia Carson (D-Ind.), who has 


 passed beyond the sound of our voices into the sunset of her 


 temporal life and into a dawn of history.



 Where did she come from? Same place as Lincoln--Kentucky. 


 And like him, she was born both to physical poverty and 


 spiritual wealth, and moved to Indiana.



 Another similarity: Julia also had an ''angel mother,'' 


 Velma Porter, who put a lot of physical, mental and spiritual 


 nutrients into the little flowerpot of her only child.



 Fast-forward to a month after my first and improbable 


 election to Congress. I was told by mutual friends that at 


 the Chrysler UAW office, I could find a remarkable woman to 


 join me as a co-worker in my Washington Congressional office. 


 Remarkable? Understatement. Thus began my 47-year friendship 


 and, eventually virtual sibling-ship with the already 


 honorable Julia Carson, one of the most intelligent, ethical, 


 industrious and compassionate people I have ever known.



 Check out her first Congressional brainstorm. It started a 


 national trend. Why make constituents in need of 


 Congressional assistance with bureaucratic problems travel 


 all the way to D.C. to get it? Why not take that part of the 


 office to them? So we adopted her suggestion and did out 


 ''case work'' in Indianapolis with Julia at the helm. It set 


 an example that has been followed by other Congressional 


 offices all over the country ever since. OK, there was one 


 other factor. She had two little kids she preferred to rear 


 in Indianapolis, doing well by her kids by doing good for her 


 country.



 Later, my refusal to bring home a particularly pernicious 


 piece of political pork earned me a severe gerrymander that, 


 together with the Nixon landslide, ejected me from Congress. 


 Nothing is all bad; the beneficiary of the gerrymander was my 


 much-admired friend, Bill Hudnut (R). That was the year I had 


 to talk Julia into running for the state House of 


 Representatives. She thought it would be disloyal to our 


 friendship because it would take her away from my campaign, 


 which was a campaign of futility that year.



 She was elected to the state House, where she served with 


 distinction and, in time, she became a state Senator, again 


 gaining friends and admirers on both sides of the aisle.



 Still later, she became the Center Township trustee and 


 produced real ''welfare reform,'' not with ignorant 


 histrionic speeches and braggadocio, but with hard, quiet and 


 meticulous work. It was reform that broke no poor child's 


 heart, nor sent such a child to bed hungry. She not only 


 ferreted out welfare cheats, but also sued them and got the 


 money back for the taxpayers. Her reform wiped out a long-


 standing multimillion-dollar debt, moving the then-Marion 


 County Republican auditor to say, ''She wrestled the monster 


 to the ground.''



 Julia was unique in that she was the only human being ever 


 to be named Woman of the Year by The Indianapolis Star on two 


 different occasions.



 It was common parlance to say, ''Congresswoman Carson's 


 people,'' a reference to poor black constituents. Rubbish. 


 The 7th district is about 70 percent nonblack and ''her 


 people'' were all the people of the 7th, regardless of 


 physical or economic description. Millionaires can be treated 


 unjustly by the federal government just as middle- and low-


 income citizens can. And wherever there was injustice, this 


 Lincoln-like lady was there to redress it. Her political 


 philosophy was a plank from the Sermon on the Mount: 


 ''Blessed are they who thirst for justice.''



 There's another one: ''Blessed are the peacemakers.'' She 


 cast our vote against the conspicuously unconstitutional 


 resolution that gave the Cheney gang a fig leaf to order our 


 innocent military to the fraudulent and internationally 


 illegal blood-soaked blunder in Iraq.



 Julia called me just before she cast that vote and said 


 that, in view of the dishonesty, panic and jingoism of the 


 moment, she expected to lose the next election. ''Courage,'' 


 my mother said, ''is fear that has said its prayers.''



 Our Julia, who art in Heaven.
