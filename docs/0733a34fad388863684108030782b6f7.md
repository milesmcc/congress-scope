`Mr. CHANDLER â€” 30 January 2007`

---


Mr. CHANDLER. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be here this afternoon to 
join the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Ross) to talk a little bit about 
what is obviously a very, very important subject to the American 
people, the subject of accountability.

Now, Mr. Ross talked a little bit about the national debt. He had a 
sign up which, as he said, Blue Dog offices all over the Capitol have 
up, showing what the national debt of this country is, and the fact 
that each and every American citizen owes over $29,000 just to pay off 
the national debt.

Now, I don't usually, or very often, come down here to join Mr. Ross 
in what I do think is a worthy goal, and that is educating the American 
people on our financial situation in this country. But I could not 
resist today. Being a former State auditor in the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, I am a little bit familiar with the issue of accountability. 
And you talk about this debt, the fact that it is as large as it is, 
the fact that our people owe, each and every one of them, over $29,000 
to pay it off, well, your next question is well, what are we going to 
do about it? What are we going to do about this debt?

Well, one of the very first things that we can do about this debt is 
demand accountability in the spending. And one of the glaring examples 
that we have got is the lack of oversight, the lack of accountability 
in the spending on the war in Iraq. The numbers are huge; almost $280 
million a day is what we are spending in Iraq.

Now, the Blue Dogs have made a decision to have a resolution which 
will show our interest in making sure that this war and the government 
of this country is accountable for the taxpayer dollars spent in this 
war. What we have done is, as Mr. Ross laid out, proposed a resolution 
that is called the Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability 
Resolution. And the resolution focused on several crucial points in 
demanding fiscal responsibility in Iraq.

The main points, the most crucial, I think, are, one, a call for 
transparency on how Iraq war funds are spent. I think another important 
point is the need to fund the Iraq war through normal appropriations, 
through that process, rather than through emergency supplemental. The 
third point that I believe is crucial, and one that I want to touch on 
a little bit today, is the creation of the Truman committee to 
investigate the awarding of contracts.

Now, what we want to do, the Blue Dogs, what we are calling for is 
the creation of a modern-day Truman committee for this war, for 
expenditures in this war in particular, because, in my opinion, you 
cannot talk about accountability in this war without talking about the 
need for this kind of committee, a Truman committee.

Now, in 1940, Congress prepared for the eventual involvement of the 
United States of America in World War II by allocating $10 billion in 
defense contracts. Early in 1941, stories of contractor mismanagement 
reached the desk of, at that time a Missouri Senator, a future 
President of the United


States of America, Harry S Truman. Truman, when he saw this 
information, decided to take action and find out for himself if this 
mismanagement of funds was, in fact, true. He took a 10,000-mile tour 
of military bases and discovered that certain contractors were getting 
a greater share of contracts available and that other contractors were 
getting paid full price for work that was either poor or inefficient. 
In short, what he discovered was rampant waste and mismanagement in 
government war contracts.



Does that sound familiar?

Well, as a result of his findings, Harry Truman went back to 
Washington and called for a special Senate committee to investigate. 
They got a lot of criticism. Many immediately criticized the Missouri 
Senator saying that his efforts might hurt war morale, while others 
thought that President Roosevelt ought to welcome this committee since 
it was being headed by a member of his own party and, therefore, would 
not be used for political gain.

Well, by unanimous consent on March 1, 1941, the Senate created what 
has proved to be the most famous and, in my judgment, the most 
successful committee of its time. The Truman Committee, with a budget 
of a mere $15,000 at the time, saved our country in excess of $15 
billion; and in the early 1940s, $15 billion was real money. Up here 
some of the people don't think it is these days, but it was big money 
to be saved.

Now, don't you think that we could use a Truman Committee today? It 
seems pretty obvious to me.

The United States has allocated some $50 billion to private 
contractors for reconstruction in the rebuilding efforts in Iraq since 
the beginning of the war, and despite this $50 billion expenditure on 
these contracts, we hear a lot of reports of mismanagement or certainly 
of inefficiency and not getting the job done that we expected to see 
done.

For instance, only 25 percent of Iraqis have access to clean water. 
And prior to the war the Iraqis had electricity for an average of 16 to 
24 hours a day, now that number is down to about 4.3 hours per day.

$17 billion of the $50 billion that has been given in contracts has 
been given through no-bid contracts to Halliburton, just to one 
company.

There were over 14,000 weapons by the United States of America, 
bought by our taxpayers and intended for Iraqi troops. Those 14,000 
weapons are now missing.

And in addition to that, over $8.8 billion of Iraqi reconstruction 
funds are simply unaccounted for by the Coalition Provisional 
Authority.

Mr. Speaker, we desperately need a modern-day Truman Committee to 
bring some accountability to this war. We have got to stop the 
bleeding. We have got to stop this expenditure from continuing to be 
wasteful. We have got to find out firsthand what is going on with the 
spending in Iraq. We owe it to the taxpayers of this country, we owe it 
to the troops who are fighting this war.

We owe it so much to the troops. This is money that the troops need 
for their welfare in Iraq that is being diverted through the wasteful 
spending of those who are going to be financing this war. We owe it to 
them to stop the mishandling, stop the mismanagement of money in Iraq.

I strongly support this Blue Dog effort to have a cost accountability 
ethic relative to the war in Iraq because it is past time, way past 
time to hold the leaders of this country accountable for the money they 
spend in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time to the gentleman for 
Arkansas, and I thank him for all of his efforts on behalf of 
accountability to the taxpayers in this country.
