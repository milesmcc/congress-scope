`Mr. HINOJOSA â€” 29 October 2007`

Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, country songs foster an 
appreciation of the many important sacrifices made by soldiers serving 
in the Armed Forces.

I want to share with our Members of the House that tomorrow, Tuesday, 
I will be accompanying Sergeant Daniel Pena from my congressional 
district, a young man 28 years old serving his third tour in Iraq. 
While on patrol, their Humvee stepped on a land mine that exploded. One 
of his colleagues riding in that Humvee was killed, and he lost his 
right arm and his right leg.

He came back to the United States where he has stayed in Walter Reed 
the last 2 months and received an artificial arm and leg and has now 
been released by Walter Reed Hospital. I'm going to accompany him and 
his father and mother to Weslaco, Texas, where he is going to receive a 
hero's welcome.

I'm pleased to tell you that I requested that country songs like 
''Only in America'' by Brooks and Dunn and ''Where the Stars and 
Stripes and the Eagle Fly'' by Aaron Tippin be played as part of the 
patriotic music that we're going to have at that celebration of a 
hero's welcome.

With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
