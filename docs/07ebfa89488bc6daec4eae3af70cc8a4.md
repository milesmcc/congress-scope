Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and thank the ranking 
member for this opportunity to speak in praise of Chris Carney. It is 
no accident that Chris and I work on a number of pieces of legislation. 
The bond between us, forged in the United States Navy, is stronger than 
any partisan bond, and he has become a real hero to me in building 
these bipartisan efforts to commemorate our men and women in uniform.

We put forward H.R. 1209, the Medal of Honor Commemorative Coin Act, 
and it is bipartisan legislation. Under the rules of the House, it had 
to get over 290 cosponsors. We think it will help the Foundation raise 
over $5 million for their benefit.

As everyone knows, the Medal of Honor is the Nation's highest award 
for valor in action against an enemy force, and it symbolizes how 
uniformed Americans have gone above and beyond the call of duty in 
defense of our Nation.

Today I am wearing a Navy Commendation Medal, which in my view is 
about 17 ranks below what is given in the Medal of Honor. There have 
been 3,400 medals awarded to date, but we are focusing our effort on 
the 97 living recipients who are among us.

They are people like Al Lynch of Gurnee, Illinois, a man who serves 
on my Veterans Advisory Board and who I know and respect. Like many of 
us veterans, when one of the Medal of Honor recipients walks into a 
room wearing that very unique insignia, everyone goes silent. I will 
say, at least from my experience and I think from other veterans, we 
all know where a Medal of Honor recipient is in the room for as long as 
he is in the room.

Al grew up in our area, went to high school, enlisted in the Army, 
and in 1966 volunteered for service in Vietnam as a rifleman and a 
platoon radio operator. In December 1967, his company was deployed to 
the Bong Son area of the central highlands. And after a month of almost 
daily fighting with the enemy, his unit was ordered to the rear for 
rest and recuperation; but that rest was short-lived, because the 
company which relieved his unit was ambushed.

As Al's platoon mobilized the next morning, he saw three wounded men. 
Not thinking of himself, he dashed across 50 meters of open ground, 
through a hail of enemy fire, and carried them one by one to safety. 
When his company was forced to withdraw, it was Al who remained to aid 
his comrades rather than abandoning them. For 2 hours, he defended 
their position against an advancing enemy.

Following this heroic action, he located the counterattacking 
friendly company to assist the attack and to evacuate the three 
casualties. He successfully completed his tour in Vietnam and was sent 
to Fort Hood, Texas, where he was discharged from the Army in 1969. A 
year later, just before he was to be married, he learned that for these 
actions he would receive the Medal of Honor, and on May 14, 1970, 
President Nixon presented it to him.

We also commend men like Sammy Davis of Flat Rock, Illinois. On 
November 18, 1967, while serving as a cannoneer at a remote fire 
support base just west of Cai Lay, Vietnam, he came under heavy mortar 
attack. Sergeant Davis single-handedly fired his howitzer several times 
at the enemy. Undaunted by an enemy mortar blast which landed 20 meters 
from his position wounding him, he continued to fight. Disregarding his 
extensive injuries and his inability to swim, Sergeant Davis used an 
air mattress to rescue three wounded comrades trapped on the other side 
of the river with the Vietcong. Upon reaching the wounded men, he stood 
and fired into the dense vegetation to prevent the enemy from 
advancing.

You may slightly recognize Sergeant Davis' story because it was the 
model for the iconic movie ''Forrest Gump,'' which was largely based on 
his experience. Footage from the Medal of Honor presentation to 
Sergeant Davis was actually used in the movie, with Tom Hanks' head 
superimposed on the body of Sammy Davis.

On July 11, 1969, Captain--then First Lieutenant--Hal Fritz from 
Peoria, was seriously wounded when he was suddenly ambushed escorting a 
truck convoy in a seven-vehicle armored column near Quan Loi in 
Vietnam.

After realizing his platoon was completely surrounded, he ran from 
vehicle to vehicle in order to reposition his men, assist the wounded, 
and provide encouragement. When the enemy attempted to overrun the 
platoon, Captain Fritz manned the machine gun and inspired his comrades 
to break the assault. Moments later, a second enemy force advanced, and 
only with a pistol and a bayonet, Captain Fritz led his small group of 
men in a daring charge that routed the attackers.

When relief arrived, Captain Fritz stayed to manage the troops. And 
when he saw they were not being deployed effectively, despite his 
wounds, refused medical attention and organized everything until his 
wounded comrades were treated and evacuated.



Maybe the most dramatic story that we have in Illinois comes on the 
day of January 8, 1945. During a battle near Kaysersberg, France, 
Sergeant Russell Dunham of Jerseyville, Illinois, single-handedly 
assaulted three enemy machine guns using a white robe made of mattress 
cover as camouflage. Sergeant Dunham crawled 75 yards under heavy fire, 
and as he jumped to his feet 10 yards from the gun, a rifle bullet hit 
him, creating a 10-inch gash across his back and sending him spinning 
15 yards down the hill into snow.

In excruciating pain, he got back up and renewed a one-man assault. 
After kicking aside a German egg grenade, Sergeant Dunham shot and 
killed the German machine gunner and assistant gunner. Sergeant Dunham 
then proceeded 50 yards through a storm of enemy fire to destroy the 
second machine gun by throwing two grenades into the emplacement. Under 
heavy fire from both machine guns and grenades, Dunham again advanced 
by crawling farther up the hill. At a range of 15 yards, he jumped to 
his feet and killed the crew of a timbered machine gun emplacement with 
hand grenades.

Despite a painful wound, Sergeant Dunham spearheaded a spectacular 
attack that saved many of his men, and he just passed away a month ago.

The stories of these four Illinois residents are just a few of the 
many extraordinary acts of heroism by soldiers, sailors, and airmen who 
went beyond the call of duty in the face of grave danger.

The legislation authored by Congressman Carney before us, H.R. 1209, 
is important because it will serve as a


reminder for these brave men and women--still numbering 90 strong--to 
promote the qualities the Medal of Honor embodies.

As the first U.S. Representative to be deployed into an imminent 
danger area since World War II, I know many of the sacrifices and 
challenges that men and women in our Armed Forces face. Almost every 
morning I think about the men and women I served with in Afghanistan 
when I left there in January.

This legislation helps us recognize the true heroes among that cadre. 
I think we will have some more heroes emerge from conflicts in Iraq and 
Afghanistan that are award winners. But today, we mark the 97 who are 
living, and those 3,400 who all received the Medal.

This legislation will help us raise money for the foundation, will 
help us advance the values that these awardees embodied, and teach us a 
very, very painful but important lesson about how important this 
country is, how valuable it is, and how much it takes to defend her.
