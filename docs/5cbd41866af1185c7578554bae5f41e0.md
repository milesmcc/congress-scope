Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, today I am introducing the Veterans Health 
Scholarship Act of 2008. This legislation would extend the authority of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to reinstate the Health 
Professional Scholarship Program and give priority to veterans in 
awarding these scholarships.

VA is known for its high quality health care. However, the supply of 
highly trained medical personnel is not growing as fast as the demand, 
and VA struggles to recruit highly trained health care professionals 
critical to providing veterans the care and services they need.

The Health Professional Scholarship Program was originally 
established to improve recruitment and retention and help reduce the 
national nursing shortage. VA lost an important tool to meet their 
current and anticipated staffing needs when the program expired in 1998 
and was not reinstated. As concerns over recruitment and retention of 
health care professionals increase, it is especially important that we 
enhance opportunities to educate a new generation of VA health care 
providers. Reinstating the authorization for this program will provide 
VA another tool to attract qualified health professionals to care for 
our nation's veterans.

Even as VA is experiencing recruiting difficulties, many 
servicemembers from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
Freedom are trained combat medics responsible for providing frontline 
trauma care on the battlefield. When they come home, we can provide the 
opportunity for these new veterans to continue their medical education, 
and use their knowledge and experience to provide needed services to 
their fellow veterans.

Madam Speaker, the quality of health care available to our veterans 
is dependent on the ability of VA to recruit and retain qualified 
health care personnel. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
will join me in this effort to build a new generation of health care 
professionals and cosponsor the Veterans Health Scholarship Act of 
2008.
