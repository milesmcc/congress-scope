Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, today it was reported that al Qaeda is as strong now as 
it was prior to the 9/11 attacks. Meanwhile, our troops who have served 
with honor and distinction are mired in the middle of a religious civil 
war in Iraq. The men and women of Iowa's National Guard have faced 
multiple redeployments at great sacrifice to them and their families.

The American people continue to demand a new way forward in Iraq. 
Even Members of the President's own party are demanding change. We must 
immediately begin to chart a new course.

I'm a cosponsor of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act because 
it provides for the safe withdrawal of combat troops by April 1, 2008. 
We must bring home our troops safely and responsibly. We must also 
redirect our efforts against terrorism.

This bill represents a step forward, and I urge its passage and the 
rule.
