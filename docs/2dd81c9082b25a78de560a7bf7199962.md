Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Country Reports on Terrorism


released by the State Department yesterday indicate that terrorist 
attacks increased by 25 percent last year, and more than 40 percent 
more people were killed. In these most dangerous times, this tells us 
we can't afford to take our focus off the global war on terror. Still, 
exactly 4 years after the President proclaimed mission accomplished 
aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, his failed Iraq policy persists in 
overextending our armed forces and in refusing to compel Iraq to take 
responsibility for their own security and future.

Today, when the President vetoes withdrawal provisions supported by a 
majority of Americans, he places another's obstacle in the way of what 
should be our priority mission, winning the global war on terror. We 
know the administration's stay-the-course policy in Iraq is a failure. 
We know it has taken our eye off the war on terror.

Now we have the numbers to back up that statement and the proof we 
need to stop the President from compounding this Nation's single 
greatest foreign policy mistakes. I encourage my colleagues to consider 
the hard and irrefutable evidence by the State Department, thereby 
advancing our withdrawal from Iraq.
