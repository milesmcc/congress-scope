`Mr. GINGREY â€” 10 September 2007`

Mr. GINGREY. The point you made, of course, about the Iraqi national 
police, General Jones, you're right. I was in that same hearing with 
Representative Kline last week, Mr. Speaker, and General Jones did talk 
about this Iraqi national police force of about 25,000 that in the past 
was rife with corruption, and of course, a lot of changes in the 
leadership, as General Petraeus pointed out today, that has occurred.

But I think it's important, and I think Mr. Kline would agree with 
me, for our colleagues to understand that the press in the last week, 
talking about the Jones report, suggested that the entire Iraqi 
security force was incompetent and corrupt when, indeed, 49,000 is only 
about 10 percent of the 550,000 Iraqi national army and combined police 
force. So many of them are doing a good job, as you pointed out in the 
hearing today.
