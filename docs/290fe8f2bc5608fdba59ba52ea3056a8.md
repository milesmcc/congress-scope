`Mr. ISRAEL â€” 2 October 2007`

---


Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Maryland and I want 
to underscore the point that he's making.

The center aisle is right here, right here in front of me. Those on 
my side of the center aisle can scream at those on the other side and 
those on the other side can scream at my side. That's not going to end 
the war. Again, this is a place, this is a House where we encourage 
debate and even dissent and disagreement, but the screaming and the 
vitriol and the partisan attacks will not bring this war to an end.

Those of us who are here this evening would prefer to spend our time 
engaging with one another, disagreeing respectfully on some issues but 
trying to find that common ground, trying to build that consensus that 
will bring the war to an end.

One of our colleagues who's here, the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. Dent), has been working very, very hard on a proposal to integrate 
the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group into current 
policy. That was a perfect example of an advanced and high plane of 
bipartisan dialogue. Members from both parties, experts from around the 
country, convened in that Iraq Study Group, made recommendations to the 
administration and to Congress. Many of those recommendations received 
widespread praise and support but have not been implemented, and the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania has been working to attempt to take those 
recommendations and move them forward, take them off the shelf and move 
them forward in our policy.

I yield to my good friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).
