# WE SHOULD DO AS WE SAY, NOT AS WE DO

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Turkish Government took its 
troops into northern Iraq and went after their nemesis, the terrorist, 
the PKK. They defeated, destroyed, and killed a great number of the PKK 
who've killed over 40,000 Turks since the 1980s and what is possibly 
the greatest terrorist group to attack a sovereign country.

Our Secretary of Defense Gates is going to be in Turkey today and has 
said he will tell the Turks to make their foray short, a matter of 
days, weeks, not months, and to respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi 
Government. I can only imagine what the Turks will tell Secretary 
Gates. Do as I say, not as I do. For have we respected the sovereignty 
of the Iraqi Government? Has our foray been short? Can we afford to 
lose more blood and more dollars in a losing attack in Iraq?

I submit to Secretary Gates, Mr. Speaker, we should do as we say, not 
as we do.
