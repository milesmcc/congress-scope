Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, just about 1 month ago I voted against 
the emergency supplemental spending bill and stated my reasons for 
doing so at some length. I will not repeat what I said then, but my 
concerns also apply to the conference report we are considering. While 
the President has provided a timeline for redeployment of our troops 
from Iraq, I remain concerned that we may see upwards of 50,000 U.S. 
troops remain in that country. Leaving such a substantial number of 
troops in Iraq could undercut the benefits of redeployment, and might 
result in a significant uptick in violence against U.S. troops.

I am also concerned that this supplemental pads the defense budget 
with items not needed for the war and outside the normal appropriations 
cycle.

Finally, and even though President Obama has a plan to focus the 
government's attention and resources where they are most needed--on 
Afghanistan and Pakistan--I am worried that the current strategy does 
not adequately address, and may even exacerbate, the serious national 
security problems we face in that part of the world. Those problems 
could be made worse, not better, by sending 21,000 more U.S. troops to 
Afghanistan and they may be further aggravated if there is not an 
adequate response to the nearly 3 million Pakistanis who have recently 
been displaced.
