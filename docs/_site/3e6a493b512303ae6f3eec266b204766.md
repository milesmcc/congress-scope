`Mrs. DAVIS of California â€” 29 April 2009`

Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. 
Res. 339.

This resolution honors the incredible work of the United States Navy 
SEALs, and the crews of the USS Bainbridge, USS Boxer, USS Halyburton 
and Patrol Squadron (VP) 8. H. Res. 339 also recognizes the crew of the 
Maersk Alabama and the courage of Captain Richard Phillips.

The Maersk Alabama and her crew returned safely due to the remarkable 
service of the men and women of the U.S. Navy. In fact, this event has 
shown the importance of having a fleet capable of maintaining a global 
maritime presence that allows the Navy to respond to emergencies around 
the world.

We must also commend the actions of our remarkable Navy SEAL snipers. 
The special operations community rarely receives the recognition they 
deserve, nor do they seek it. While they do not look for notoriety, 
this resolution honors their service and recognizes their contributions 
to U.S. national security.

The success of the Navy SEAL snipers who saved Captain Phillips is a 
prime example of the superior training our SEALs receive; training that 
begins at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado and reinforced through 
multiple tours of duty in Iraq, Afghanistan, and now off the coast of 
Somalia.

Mr. Speaker, I know I join all Americans in welcoming this crew home 
with both great pride and great relief and in honoring our brave 
service members for a job well done.

I hope all of my colleagues vote in favor of this important measured.
