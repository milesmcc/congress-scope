Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, we need an American 
energy plan and we need it now. The American people are hurting. Young 
families are hurting. Senior adults are hurting. Small businesses are 
hurting. Vern, from Jefferson County, Tennessee, is hurting.

Vern is an Iraqi war veteran. Vern has to drive from Jefferson County 
in Tennessee all the way into Knoxville. It's costing him over $90 a 
week to drive to work. He makes $8 an hour. He's trying to become an 
electrical apprentice.

Vern told me he may have to go on welfare. Vern has a young family. 
Vern is an Iraqi war yet. Vern wants to do what's right by his family. 
He has already done what's right by America. This Congress needs to do 
what's right for Vern and other young families in America, senior 
adults in America, small businesses in America.

We don't need any more excuses. We need to vote on meaningful energy 
legislation. We need to do it now. We don't need to go home, we need to 
take votes. I'm willing to stay here today and vote. We voted this 
week. We had time to vote to go home. We ought to have time to vote to 
bring down gas prices at the pump. The American people demand it, they 
demand it now.
