Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize 
Lydia Zuidema of Saint Joseph, Missouri. Lydia is active in the 
community through her work and has been chosen to receive the YWCA 
Women of Excellence Award for Woman in the Workplace.

Lydia is the superintendent and a teacher at St. Joseph Christian 
School. She instituted the school's National Institute for Learning 
Development program and has traveled to Afghanistan and South Africa to 
train other teachers. In Afghanistan, she helped staff and faculty 
prepare to receive accreditation; in South Africa, she trained early 
childhood educators. She never wavers from her sense of peace and calm, 
which comes from her great love for and dedication to the Lord.

Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in recognizing Lydia 
Zuidema. She has made an amazing impact on countless individuals in the 
St. Joseph Community. I am honored to represent her in the United 
States Congress.
