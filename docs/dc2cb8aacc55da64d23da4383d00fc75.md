# WAR SUPPLEMENTAL IS BAD POLITICS, BAD POLICY

Mr. KINGSTON. I want to say also on a bipartisan basis, you have a 
lot of support for the good that is in the supplemental. I will hand it 
to the Democrat leadership, the Democrats on the Appropriations, for 
putting in things that we know the troops need such as the MRAPs, the 
Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Humvees the troops want; more money for 
the joint IED defeat fund. We had some really good testimony on that. 
Increases for the defense health care program, that is important; more 
money for equipment and training, more money for Afghanistan to 
counterterrorist-laden regions, money for a shortfall in the theater. 
There is some very good things in this bill that we believe, on a 
bipartisan basis, that the troops need.

But the part which requires the Iraqi Government to do certain 
things, which they may or may not be able to do by a deadline of July 
1, really does tie up the Commander in Chief. I will say we are an 
equal branch of government, but the Commander in Chief is in charge of 
wars, not Members of Congress.

Just to give you an example, to rewrite the Iraqi hydrocarbon law, 
which has to do with revenue sharing of the oil, I think it's a good 
thing to do. But I think if you say it has to be done a date certain, 
July 1, they might not be able to do that.

Here we are in the United States Government, last year we could not 
pass a budget. Right now, we are having trouble passing a budget. 
Sometimes these things take longer than they do shorter.

We got to give a new government the opportunity to get things done 
and not micromanage their government. But I think the biggest concern 
is, among other things, that there is still a pullout. There is still a 
date certain for a pullout, August 2008, and it's possible Iraqis won't 
be ready. It's possible we could do it before then.

What General Petraeus has outlined for us is to go full-fledged with 
this troop surge, bring stabilization while ramping up the training of 
our Iraqis, so that we can hand them the baton in a way that we have 
continued stabilization, and then we can go home. I think letting 
General Petraeus call that shot in Baghdad is far more important than 
435 wannabe generals here in the United States Congress and in 
Washington.
