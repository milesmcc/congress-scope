## `aef9cbc1609a8d7f20e03349669aad66`
`Mr. FORBES â€” 3 October 2007`

Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

This amendment, Madam Chairman, expands the reporting requirement of 
the Department of Justice Inspector General to include a list of 
charges that have been brought against contractors and contract 
employees in Iraq and Afghanistan, a list of all criminal 
investigations and reports made with respect to contractors and 
contract employees in Iraq and Afghanistan in cases where no criminal 
charges were ultimately brought, and a description of the legal actions 
taken by the United States Government against contractors and contract 
employees in Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of a criminal charge or 
criminal investigation.



This is important information that Congress should be provided in 
order to make informed and accurate decisions regarding the 
investigation and prosecution of offenses by contractors overseas. I 
urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
