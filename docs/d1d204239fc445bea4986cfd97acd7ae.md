Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 340. 
This resolution makes technical corrections to the Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act, commonly known as GINA, the act that we just 
passed. Specifically, this resolution will clarify the use of genetic 
information at forensic laboratories used by law enforcement agencies. 
This technical correction ensures the Department of Defense will be 
able to use genetic information to identify the remains of American 
servicemen and women.

The recent DNA identification of Staff Sergeant Matt Maupin, missing 
since his capture in Iraq in 2004, offers us a painful reminder of why 
genetic information may be needed to identify the heroic men and women 
who give their lives in service to this Nation.



This is a simple, yet necessary change to a bill that enjoys the 
support of a vast majority of this body. Adoption of this resolution 
will allow this legislation to move forward.

The GINA bill marks a commitment by this Congress to ensure that the 
law protects American workers and health care consumers from 
discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup. Because that goal 
is so critical, I support this resolution today, and urge my colleagues 
to do likewise.

I yield back the balance of my time.
