Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to 
the life of CPL Victor H. Toledo Pulido, who lost his life defending 
our Nation in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

After attending high school in California's Central Valley, Victor 
joined the Army Reserves in 2005. A year later, he signed up for active 
duty and was stationed at Fort Benning, GA. Victor was proud to serve 
in the military.

While serving with the 1st Calvary Regiment based out of Fort 
Benning, Victor wore his green camouflage uniform with pride. 
Unfortunately, on Wednesday, May 23, 2007, the vehicle in which Victor 
traveled was hit with an improvised explosive device. Victor and 
another solider were killed in the incident.



CPL Victor Toledo Pulido is survived by his mother, Maria Gaspar of 
Kettleman City, his wife, Cristi Toledo, and brothers, Yosio and Gaston 
Toledo Pulido. Also surviving is his son, Isak and numerous friends.

It is my belief that Victor's life symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice 
one can make for his country. His valor, strength, courage and pride in 
our Nation will forever live in the thoughts and hearts of his family 
and Americans across the Nation. CPL Victor H. Toledo Pulido's 
dedication to the principles of freedom and democracy will serve as an 
example to all of us and for generations to come.
