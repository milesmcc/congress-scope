Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank 
Chairman Skelton for his leadership on this issue, as well as the 
ranking member, Mr. Hunter.

If you look back at what happened at Walter Reed, and it is on the 
outside of the care, not the inside care of the hospital that we are 
talking about, the Wounded Warriors Act certainly is a good first step.

One of the things that I want to address, I want to say thank you to 
Chairman Murtha for the commitment he has made to our military as far 
as making sure the money is in there so that we can implement what we 
need to do.

As we all know, head trauma has become the focus of a lot of these 
veterans that are coming home. With the IEDs in Iraq, traumatic brain 
injury has become the signature wound of this conflict. Our soldiers 
receive outstanding acute medical care; but people have to understand, 
it used to be thought that after 6 months of treatment, someone with a 
head injury would be fine and they would just kind of let them go. That 
is not true.

Back in 1993, my son was shot in the head and he certainly sustained 
very traumatic head injury. It takes a long time, and we know that we 
can give treatment for years after. It is 13 years since my son's head 
treatment, and he is still receiving therapy. So this is a good first 
start, and I hope we continue with it.
