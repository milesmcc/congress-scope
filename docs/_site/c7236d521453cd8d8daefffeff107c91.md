Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

The consumer bankruptcy overhaul signed into law 3 years ago adds a 
means test that presumes a debtor is abusing the law if he or she has 
income that exceeds a modest threshold, and thereby forces the debtor 
into a multiyear repayment plan.

This bill, S. 3197, excepts qualifying National Guard and Reserve 
members from that presumption of abuse. We have the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) to thank for this.

With half a million members of the National Guard and Reserve called 
to Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11, many serving multiple tours of 
duty, the financial toll on their families has been severe.



It's estimated that up to 26 percent of National Guard members 
deployed experience money problems as a direct result. And so the 
measure before us makes an exception-to-the-means test presumption of 
abuse for National Guard and Reserve members who serve 90 days since 
September 11, 2001, and for a year and a half after they leave service. 
I'm heartened to know that we now have the opportunity to provide this 
modest but important relief to these brave men and women in the 
service.

I also commend Ranking Member Lamar Smith of Texas who has helped 
make this a bipartisan endeavor.

I reserve the balance of my time.
