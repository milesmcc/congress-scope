`Mr. GRAHAM â€” 30 June 2010`

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate tonight that last 
night the University of South Carolina won the College World Series. I 
never thought I would live long enough to hear myself say that.

I have been a Gamecocks fan since high school. I went to the 
University of South Carolina, and there is no group of people who loves 
sports and their university more than the University of South Carolina, 
but we have been a long-suffering group.

We have been waiting for next year every year I can remember, and we 
have knocked on the door and the door has never opened. But this group 
of young men and Coach Tanner of the University of South Carolina 
baseball team were down and out, one strike away from elimination, lost 
the first game, and made it all the way through to beat great teams 
such as Clemson. Last night's game, if you watched it--it was over 
about 12:30--was a nail-biter. It was probably the best example of 
college baseball I have ever seen, amateur athletics. And what a 
fitting tribute to Rosenblatt Stadium for that to be the last game. It 
was a well-played game. To the opponents at UCLA, I know your heart was 
broken, but you acquitted yourself well.

I rise on behalf of the University of South Carolina, my alma mater, 
and the State of South Carolina to let people in South Carolina and 
throughout the country know that we finally did it, that this group of 
young men pitched incredibly well, had timely hits, and never gave up. 
It was about a lot more than baseball to the people in South Carolina. 
To those who have been following Gamecock sports, there is the legend 
of the chicken curse, that our mascot is a gamecock fighting chicken 
and we have been cursed because of that. I am here to tell you on the 
Senate floor tonight that the chicken curse is over. Long live the 
Gamecock Nation.

To my friends at Clemson--I live 5 miles away from the baseball 
stadium at Clemson University--your day is coming. It won't be long 
before I will be able to take this floor and celebrate Clemson 
University's winning of the College World Series.

Upon the passing of Robert C. Byrd, this body and this country has 
lost a great public servant.

To the people of South Carolina, we have something to be proud of.

As we go into the holiday season--the July 4th holiday is right 
around the corner--let's remember what it is all about: the birth of 
our Nation. I will be going to Afghanistan and Iraq, having the Fourth 
of July celebration with our troops. I ask every American to keep them 
in their prayers because what we are going to do on the Fourth of July, 
being with our family and friends, is only made possible because of 
their sacrifice.

Mr. President, I wish you and your family a great holiday.
