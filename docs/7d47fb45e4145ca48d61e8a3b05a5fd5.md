`Mr. CARTER â€” 4 September 2007`

Mr. CARTER. I told everybody about that trip to Iraq. The man who led 
that trip to Iraq is here, Congressman Mike Burgess, one of my 
classmates, came into Congress with me. He is from the great State of 
Texas, the northern part of our State, from the Dallas-Ft. Worth-Denton 
area.

Congressman Burgess was the leader of our group that went over for 
our long weekend. Congressman Burgess may tell us about the trip and 
has pictures to look at.
