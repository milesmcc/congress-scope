`Mr. GRIFFITH â€” 29 October 2009`

Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
accomplishments of former Congressman and the 21st Secretary of the 
Army John McHugh.

In more than 8 terms in Congress, Secretary McHugh has served as a 
steadfast and reliable advocate for our men and women in uniform. His 
drive and determination for our soldiers have played a major role in 
the way we repay our troops.

Throughout his career, Secretary McHugh has always sought new ways to 
serve his country, and America is better for it. Over the last eight 
years, he has made fourteen official visits to Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
multiple other deployed locations to visit United States forces.

In his own words, Secretary McHugh has inspired many. Earlier this 
year, he summed up perfectly what it means to be an American--in 
uniform or civilian--when he asked, ''What else can I do to serve?''

The United States Army has been placed in the capable hands of 
Secretary John McHugh, and I wish him the best of luck in his new 
position.
