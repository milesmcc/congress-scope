`Mr. NELSON of Florida â€” 20 April 2007`

---


Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to say to my friend 
and


my colleague and our leader that the President of the United States, 
when he was Governor of Texas, had a reputation as someone who reached 
out as a uniter, bringing together the two parties in a bipartisan way. 
Since the President has been elected President and has served in that 
capacity, he has chosen to change, for what reason I do not know 
because the country yearns for bipartisanship. That was clearly one of 
the messages that came out of last year's election, the 2006 election, 
that the people of this country are tired of the partisan bickering, 
and they want us to come together. Yet, as the majority leader was just 
recounting, there has been occasion after occasion where it seems, 
unnecessarily, that the White House has gone out of its way to attack 
someone simply because they were a member of the other party.


I want to give the Senate an example. Because I had been twice 
before, over a 6-year period, to visit the President of Syria, 
immediately upon the Iraq study commission report that recommended that 
we open up to Syria, this Senator from Florida decided that I was going 
to go back, hoping that there might be some encounter in that 
conversation with the President of Syria that might crack the door a 
little bit. I did that in the week before Christmas.

The White House chose to attack me for having made that trip--
however, very conveniently not attacking any Republican Senator who 
happened to follow, as did two Democratic Senators and one Republican 
Senator in a week or two after I made that trip.

So, too, it is noteworthy that the White House chose to attack 
Speaker
Nancy Pelosi in her visit with President Assad while being 
mute about the congressional delegation that had just visited President 
Assad 4 days earlier, which included my good personal friends, the 
Congressman from Virginia, Frank Wolf, and the Congressman from 
Pennsylvania, Joe Pitts. 

When we are facing an issue of war and peace, as we are now, we have 
to come together. The person at the top has to set the standard and the 
atmosphere. These kind of attacks that become personal, as they were 
against Speaker Pelosi, are not going to do anybody any good.
