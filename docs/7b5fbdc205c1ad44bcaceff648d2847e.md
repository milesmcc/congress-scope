`Mr. ELLISON â€” 18 January 2007`

Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentlewoman from California. And I was told 
early on, Madam Speaker, that the gentlewoman from California wanted to 
feature Congress people who had voted for the war in Iraq and then had 
subsequently changed their minds. I was persistent in trying to be a 
part of tonight's special order, and I thank the gentlewoman from 
California for allowing me to, because I just wanted to point out that 
back in 2003 I had no idea that I would ever be standing in the halls 
of Congress, but I did know in 2003, in March, that this war was wrong 
and we needed to stand absolutely against it.

But I respect those Members of Congress who came forward tonight and 
pointed out that this war is wrong, was wrong, and we have to get out 
of Iraq now.

Today--after 6 long years of subsidies to big oil companies with 
outrageous profit margins--we made a bold change for America.

Today we gave America an energy policy that will move the Nation 
towards a day in which no young American will ever again have to fight 
another oil war for any President--especially this one.

The President finally admitted last Wednesday night what most 
Americans have known for a long time.

His Iraq policy is a failure.

I rise today to strongly oppose this President's solution to that 
failure--a surge of American troops.

Surge in Bushspeak is plain and simple--an expansion of the same 
disastrous policy in Iraq.

The vast majority of our country's top military and foreign policy 
experts disagree with the viability of the President's approach.

This list includes the current Joint Chiefs of Staff, current 
military commanders in the region--General Abizaid and Casey, the 
Baker-Hamilton commission and former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

Republican Senator Chuck Hagel told it like it is last week: ''I 
think this speech given last night by this President represents the 
most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam.'' 
As a Vietnam Veteran he should know.

Our military leaders state we must view Iraq policy as a three-legged 
stool.

Each leg of the stool represents a key strategy to support 
reconstruction of Iraq--one leg represents our military strategy, one 
economic and one political.

All 3 legs have to be present, and strong, to ensure Iraqi success. 
If one strategy is over-emphasized--and others don't even exist--the 
stool and our strategy falls apart.

The President's plan is--at best--a one-legged stool--our military 
involvement. A one-legged stool cannot stand.

Nor should it--when it is built on the lives of 22,000 young 
Americans.

I am not a military expert, but experts of counterinsurgencies look 
at Iraq and recommend a military force of a quarter million, to a half 
million troops for any hope of success.

[Let me be clear I am not for any increase in our troop levels in 
Iraq]

But, 22,000 troops don't even come close to making this critical 
military benchmark.

Ted Carpenter of the Cato Institute stated last week:

. . . A lesser deployment would have no realistic chance to get the 
job done. A limited surge of additional troops is the latest illusory 
panacea offered by the people who brought us the Iraq quagmire in the 
first place. It is an idea that should be rejected.

This is a reckless and irresponsible proposal. To allow the President 
to place these selfless young Americans in a virtual shooting gallery 
is wrong.

Since last night, 3,012 of America's most promising young men and 
women have lost their lives in Iraq--and over 22,000 more have been 
grievously wounded.

We have squandered more than $350 billion of our Treasury in Iraq 
with no end in sight.

Three hundred fifty billion dollars would fund 48 million kids a year 
of Head Start; it could provide 17 million students 4 year scholarships 
at public universities; we could build 3 million additional housing 
units; or we could hire 6 million more public school teachers for one 
year.

Instead, we've dug 3,012 graves and mortgaged our children's future. 
Enough is enough.

Monday, we celebrated Dr. Martin Luther King's life and work. In one 
of Dr. King's last speeches in which he criticized our Vietnam policy, 
Dr. King stated that: ''a time comes when silence is betrayal.''

That time has come--and our continued silence will be our Nation's 
betrayal. The immediate withdrawal of our troops is the only new way 
out of Iraq:

Lt. Gen. William Odom, of the Hudson Institute said, (and I quote): 
''The wisdom and moral courage to change the course for strategic 
purposes is what we need today, not mindless rhetoric 'about staying 
the course.' 'Cutting and running' from Iraq is neither cowardly nor 
imprudent. It is the only way to recover from what is turning out to be 
the greatest strategic mistake in American history.''

I concur wholeheartedly.

I thank the gentlewoman from California for her courage and 
persistence in the pursuit of peace; the pursuit of a saner and safer 
world for our children, and all the children of the world.
