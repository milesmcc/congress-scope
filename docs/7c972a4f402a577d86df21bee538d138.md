Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week, President Bush 
vetoed the Iraqi supplemental. I am disappointed that the President did 
not attempt to work with us here in Congress prior to his veto. We are 
now back at square one.

The American people want a new direction for Iraq. Our current 
strategy is not working, with more sectarian violence spreading 
throughout Iraq each and every day. If a solution will be reached in 
this conflict, the Iraqi government must take more responsibility for 
their future.

The U.S. commitment to end the war in Iraq cannot be open-ended. We 
must put pressure on the Iraqi government to make political, economical 
and diplomatic reforms. So far these reforms have not been made, and 
little progress has been shown by the Iraqi government.

Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the Iraqi war and we talk about 
terrorism, Iraq did not have terrorists there until we went in, did not 
do our job in the first several months, and that is why we have 
terrorism in Iraq today. We must defeat it. We must bring our boys 
home.

Let the Iraqi government now take care of their own problems.
