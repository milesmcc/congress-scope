Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, as the hour grows late here this evening, I 
and some of my fellow freshmen colleagues have gathered here on the 
floor to talk about the issue that is overarching everything we do in 
this country today, the war in Iraq.

When we were elected in November, many of us came here on a mandate 
for change, a mandate for a change of direction in the way the country 
was heading and a mandate for change in direction in Iraq. So, tonight 
we are here to talk about the important events of this day, the action 
that this House took to pass a very important bill, the Responsible 
Redeployment From Iraq Act, and also to talk about the report that was 
recently released from the White House on Iraq and the benchmarks that, 
sadly, are not being met.

With that, I would like to actually turn this discussion over to some 
of my fellow colleagues. We will begin with a statement and some 
commentary from the gentleman from New Hampshire, the distinguished 
gentleman from New Hampshire, Mr. Paul Hodes.
