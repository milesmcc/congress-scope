`Ms. GRANGER â€” 25 May 2007`

---


Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage of a 
brave and dedicated hero of the Fort Worth community and of our Nation.

MSgt Kenneth N. Mack was a proud United States Marine and a true 
American hero who gallantly gave his life for his country on May 5, 
2007, during combat operations in Al Anbar Province, Iraq.

Assigned to the Second Marine Expeditionary Force, Master Sergeant 
Mack's 25 years of faithful service as a Marine are an inspiration to 
all Americans, particularly the men he so ably led.

Kenneth Mack leaves behind his wife, Peggy, mother, Mahalia, and his 
daughter and son.

Our community and Nation honor Kenneth Mack's memory and we are 
grateful for his faithful and distinguished service to America.

MSgt Kenneth N. Mack will never be forgotten. His memory lives on 
through his family, the Marines who were entrusted to his care and the 
legacy of selfless service that he so bravely imprinted on our hearts.
