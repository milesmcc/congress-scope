`Mr. LEVIN â€” 10 July 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while we disagree on a very critical issue, 
I as always look forward to working with Senator McCain to work out 
agreements so we can move this bill forward. I am confident we will 
pass the authorization bill this year, the way we have every other 
year, for the reasons Senator McCain gives, which are the critically 
important provisions in here for the men and women in our military and 
their families.

The difference is apparently as to whether this is an appropriate 
place to debate Iraq policy. It is an authorization bill, which, it 
seems to me, is a very appropriate place to debate policy; in fact, I 
think is the most appropriate place to debate a policy issue such as 
Iraq.

I have not wished this to be debated on an appropriations bill, 
because I don't think we ought to try to have a policy debate and 
decision when it involves the funding of our troops because I think 
hopefully all of us want to fund our troops. This is an issue as to 
whether we should change course in Iraq. This is a debate which is a 
healthy debate, it is an essential debate. I look forward actually to 
working with Senator McCain to see if we cannot come up with time 
agreements on debates on Iraq--on these amendments on Iraq.

There is going to be more than one amendment. There are going to be a 
number of amendments and hopefully we can come up with time agreements 
so we can have these debates, have votes on the Iraq issue, and then 
move on, and move forward and adopt an authorization bill with a lot of 
other amendments that are pending as well.

I am, as always, an optimist. I am particularly an optimist when I 
look at Senator McCain, when I realize that we have worked together 
before, as I have with Senator Warner, on issues that look intractable 
but which are not and can be worked out, and hopefully there can be 
time agreements on these amendments relative to Iraq--which are 
important amendments.


I cannot think of anything that affects the well-being of our troops 
or our Nation, frankly, more at this moment than the question of policy 
in Iraq, as to whether that policy needs to be changed. There are 
differences as to whether we ought to change course in Iraq, and there 
are some who feel that apparently the policy is working. There are some 
of us who feel the status quo is not working, we need to change it.

It is not the debate we should have or can have at this moment. We 
are in the middle of a discussion on the Webb amendment. But it is 
appropriate that on this bill, the Senate act. If anything, it has been 
too long, as far as I am concerned, since the Senate has taken a 
position on this. The last time we did it 4 months ago, the President 
vetoed it. We were unable to have our will expressed in a way that was 
not vetoed.

Waiting until September is not an answer, because there is no reason 
to believe that an effort in September will not be filibustered. There 
is no reason why in September, the people who oppose the change in 
course, the Senators who oppose it, will not get up and say: Well, 
let's wait until October when there is another report which is due. We 
cannot simply delay carrying out our responsibility. We cannot delay a 
debate which is on the most critical subject on the minds of the people 
of America. Waiting for September, when a general is going to give us a 
recommendation, and the President is going to give us a recommendation, 
is a delaying tactic on an issue which is the single most important 
issue on the minds of Americans today. There is no more appropriate 
place to debate this issue than on the Defense authorization bill, 
because it is here where policy issues can and should be debated; a 
better place than on an appropriation bill where the message which 
would be sent to our troops has more to do with whether we are going to 
fund the troops than whether we should continue a policy in Iraq which, 
so far at least, is not working.

So I am going to continue to be the optimist. I look forward to 
working with Senator McCain. I think our leaders can continue to work 
together to try to work on time agreements for the Iraq amendments. I 
hope and expect we will adopt an authorization bill this year.

There is nothing unique about the Senate having healthy, vigorous 
debate. That is not unique. Sometimes it looks as though we are not 
going to be able to get something done and, lo and behold, we are able 
to get something done because the American people want us--Senator 
McCain is right--the American people want us to act. We are on the 
verge of acting on the single most important issue on the minds of the 
American people. It was an issue which, more than any other, impacted 
the last election. It was an issue where the Senate spoke in April, and 
where what we did was vetoed by the President. It is an issue where now 
we must face an historic decision: Is the course in Iraq working or 
does it need to be changed? And, if it needs to be changed, what is our 
responsibility in terms of bringing about that change?

Those are issues we cannot duck. Those are issues we should not 
avoid. Those are issues which belong on our desks, and require the best 
possible judgment we can bring.

I yield the floor.
