Mr. ELLSWORTH. Madam Speaker, on Friday, September 7, 2007, I missed 
rollcall votes Nos. 860, 861, 862, 863, and 864 because I was leading a 
congressional delegation trip to conduct oversight in Iraq and to meet 
with U.S. military leadership and American men and women in uniform who 
are currently serving in theater.

Had I been present for rollcall 860, H. Res. 636 which provided for 
the consideration of H.R. 1908, Patent Reform Act of 2007, I would have 
voted ''yes.''

Had I been present for rollcall 861, H. Res. 637 which provided for 
the consideration of conference report to accompany H.R. 2669, College 
Cost Reduction and Access Act, I would have voted ''yes.''

Had I been present for rollcall 862, the Conyers Amendment to H.R. 
1908, Patent Reform Act of 2007, I would have voted ''yes.''

Had I been present for rollcall 863, final passage of H.R. 1908, 
Patent Reform Act of 2007, I would have voted ''no.''

Had I been present for rollcall 864, on agreeing to the Conference 
Report to H.R. 2669, College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, I would have 
voted ''yes.''
