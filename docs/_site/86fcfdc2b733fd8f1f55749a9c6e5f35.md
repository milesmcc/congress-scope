Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have gone from this 
morning and trying to copy one of the trick plays from the Super Bowl 
to now going to the science bill, and I guess it is modern math. We 
don't accept that, Madam President. What we demand for the American 
people is an up-or-down vote on the escalation of the war in Iraq. 
McCain has been filed. Let's vote on it. Let's vote on Warner. That is 
our proposal. We haven't wavered from that. We will not waiver from 
that. That is what the American people demand and ultimately they will 
get. I object.
