Mr. HOYER. I thank the Republican whip for yielding.

On Monday the House will meet in pro forma session at 2 p.m. On 
Tuesday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and at 2 
p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On 
Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative 
business. On Friday no votes are expected at this time.

We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A final 
list of suspension bills will be announced, as is the custom, by the 
close of business tomorrow. We expect to consider the Iraq/Afghanistan 
supplemental appropriations bill. In addition, we also hope to consider 
the farm bill conference report. And it is possible, if the budget 
conference were completed, that we might consider that as well.
