Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we all know, time has been reserved for 
Senator Feingold for up to an hour. He


says he is going to take less time, but he has that time, at which time 
I will respond to him. What I wish to do is lock in some time for 
Senator Pryor immediately following my remarks so he may speak on the 
issue of Iraq.
