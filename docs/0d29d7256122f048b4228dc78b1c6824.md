Mr. OBEY. I yield myself 1 additional minute.

I have the highest respect and appreciation for our troops who have 
done everything asked of them, but they are being let down by the 
inability of the governments of Afghanistan and, in some instances, 
Pakistan to do their parts. I would be willing to support additional 
war funding provided that Congress would vote up or down explicitly on 
whether or not to continue this policy after a new National 
Intelligence Estimate is produced. But absent that discipline, I cannot 
look my constituents in the eye and say that this operation will hurt 
our enemies more than it hurts us, and so I will reluctantly vote 
''no.''

I reserve the balance of my time.
