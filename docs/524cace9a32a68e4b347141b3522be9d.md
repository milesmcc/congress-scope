Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, again, let me just notify the gentleman 
who just spoke, there is truly nothing in our bill that deals with the 
issue of privatization or with States and privatization. I think the 
gentleman is confused with the Agriculture appropriations bill and with 
the farm bill which occurred a week ago. That was addressed in the farm 
bill. There is nothing in our bill that deals with the issue of 
privatization.

I think it's again worth noting that all we are speaking about here 
is a report. What I can't understand is why we would not want to know 
about the cost of contracting out and what is happening. That is what 
our responsibility is, to ask questions. We have oversight 
responsibility of these Federal agencies.

As I pointed out before, you have 21,000 Americans, 43,000 foreign 
contractors, 118,000 Iraqis all employed in Iraq by U.S. tax dollars, 
according to the most recent government data. You have got the massive 
privatization of military jobs which have been taken up with 
construction, security, weapons systems, maintenance, and, in fact, we 
can't even keep track of that effort. We have a responsibility, whether 
it is Department of Agriculture, whether it is Department of Defense, 
whatever Department it is.

If we want to hold the jobs that we have, we ought to be asking 
questions about how taxpayers' dollars are being spent by these 
agencies. And it's fiscally responsible, and it is what we are charged 
with doing. You may choose not to know what they are doing because you 
concur that that's the thing to do, to replace Federal employees and 
their jobs. You can hold that view, but let's get the information. 
Let's get a mere report to do it.

I ask for a ''no'' vote on this amendment.
