## `20e52af073a733c302d8d2e74c6b7eca`
`Mr. DAVIS of Illinois â€” 18 June 2007`

---


Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the 
consideration of H.R. 2563, which names the postal facility in 
Marshalltown, Iowa after Major Scott Nisely.

H.R. 2563, which was introduced by Representative Tom Latham on June 
5, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2007, by 
voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Iowa 
congressional delegation.

Major Scott Nisely was killed in combat near Al Asad, Iraq on 
September 20, 2006. He served in the Marines as an officer on Active 
Duty and as a reservist with the 133rd Infantry Battalion Charlie 
Company.

He worked 12 years for the U.S. Postal Service in Marshalltown, Iowa. 
Due to his strong desire to serve his country, he accepted an enlisted 
rank in order to fill a vacancy in the Iowa Army National Guard. Major 
Scott had served a tour of duty during Operation Desert Storm as a 
marine, in addition to Operation Iraqi Freedom as a guardsman. He will 
be fondly remembered for his patriotism and love of family.

Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Tom Latham, for 
introducing this legislation, and urge its passage.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
