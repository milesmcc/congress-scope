Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman who just spoke said that 
withdrawing from Iraq will destabilize the Middle East. The President's 
policy has already destabilized the Middle East.

He says that this policy endorses failure. The fact is that the only 
endorsement of failure comes on the part of those who will vote to 
continue the President's existing policy, because the President's 
policy in Iraq has been a 4-year failure.

We need a change in direction. The only question about the 
President's policy is whether it will produce a disaster or whether it 
will produce a catastrophe, and I am afraid it will produce the latter.

Mr. Speaker, I now yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha).
