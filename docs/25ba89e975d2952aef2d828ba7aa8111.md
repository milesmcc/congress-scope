Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, as we begin to wind down, we started this 
discussion about the impact of Iraq and the economy, and the economy 
and Iraq. And I think we started it from the beginning saying this 
country, we Americans have spent $600 billion on this effort in Iraq. 
And at a minimum, as we've discussed tonight, what could we do, 
certainly in the future, in terms of Iraq, from the right standpoint, 
taking responsibility and making it stand up and step up for itself and 
paying for its reconstruction, its fuel needs that Americans are having 
to pay for right now, and the training of its military.

And those resources, those American dollars can certainly be applied 
in a way to make us safer in dealing with, as you express, national 
security interests by taking us away from the addiction to oil and 
coming up with wonderful new renewable energy sources. The technology 
is there, it's being developed, it's being refined. We can take the 
question of the jobs and our economy right now, and of course the 
environment.

And so, as we begin to wrap up, if you can give some final thoughts 
as to how the Iraq and the economy are tied together and how we can get 
beyond this point and do good things for this country.
