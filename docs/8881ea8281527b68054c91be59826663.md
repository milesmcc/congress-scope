Mr. McGOVERN. I thank Chairman Obey for yielding me the time and for 
his incredible leadership on so many issues.

Madam Speaker, after nearly 10 years, thousands of American troops 
killed or wounded, and hundreds of billions of dollars of borrowed 
money, I believe we must radically change our policy in Afghanistan.

Of all the disturbing things in the recent Rolling Stone article 
about this war, the most disturbing was this: a senior adviser to 
General McChrystal said that if the American people paid more attention 
to the war, it would become even less popular.

Well, after seeing the documents published yesterday, it's clear what 
he was talking about: corruption and incompetence in the Afghan 
Government, questions about the role of the Pakistani intelligence 
services.

Madam Speaker, the same old same old is simply not working, and it's 
costing us dearly. At a time when the American people are suffering 
through the worst economy in generations, we're told that we can't 
afford to extend unemployment benefits. We're told that we can't afford 
to help States keep cops on the beat or teachers in the classroom. 
We're told we can't afford to help more families send their kids to 
college.

But today, we're asked to borrow another $33 billion for nation-
building in Afghanistan.

Well, with all due respect, Madam Speaker, I think we need to do some 
more nation-building here at home.

All of us are dedicated to defeating al Qaeda wherever they are, but 
our current policy in Afghanistan is deeply flawed. Occupying 
Afghanistan in support of a corrupt and incompetent government will 
continue to claim the lives of our soldiers. It will continue to 
bankrupt us, and it will not enhance our national security.

This is not just the President's war. It's our war too. Congress has 
an obligation to ask the tough questions and demand straight answers. 
We must not simply kick the can down the road and hope for the best.

Our troops and their families have made incredible sacrifices. They 
deserve a policy worthy of those sacrifices. It is a mistakes to give 
this administration yet another blank check for this war.

I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on this bill and make it clear 
that Congress demands a different approach.
