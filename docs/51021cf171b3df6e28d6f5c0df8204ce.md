`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 24 January 2007`

---


Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank you, Mr. Meek.

It is an honor to be standing in the traditional place of Mr. Ryan 
today, and I will attempt to equal at least half of his eloquence on 
this floor.

You are right, I think there are a lot of missing pieces from that 
speech last night. It was my first opportunity to sit and listen to a 
Presidential State of the Union, and you couldn't help but leave 
disappointed. There were a lot of promises that I think the American 
people were looking to be fulfilled in that speech.

Mr. Meek, I think you were exactly right when you talked about a 
sense of bipartisanship, which I think is infectious in this building 
right now due to the first 100-hours agenda that, as we know, drew 
bipartisan support, on average 60 Members of the other aisle supporting 
each piece of that 100-hours agenda. That bipartisanship seems to be 
lost when it comes to the issue of Iraq.

It doesn't go without note that since the President had unveiled his 
plan to escalate this war, to put another 21,000 brave men and women in 
harm's way to do a job that Colin Powell and others will tell you 
100,000 people can't do.
