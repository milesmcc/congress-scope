Mr. SESSIONS. Perhaps so.

With regard to those young officers who were on the Harvard campus, 
my understanding of the military--and the Senator's experience is far 
greater than mine--is that many of those officers may well have just 
returned from Iraq or Afghanistan. You don't just serve all your career 
as a recruiter. I mean, they may have been combat officers or 
helicopter pilots or convoy leaders putting their lives at risk. I 
wonder how the Senator thinks they felt when they faced this kind of 
discrimination.
