Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I will take back my time because I'm 
trying to get an honest answer.

We are setting policy here, not just for this week. We are saying 
here that if you do business with the government, if your government 
has business interests with Iraq, you're ineligible. I think it is fair 
to ask whether Iraq, if it were to become eligible in other ways, would 
be covered. That's not a trick question. Would this have the effect of 
excluding Iraq from such a program in the future?

I yield for an answer.
