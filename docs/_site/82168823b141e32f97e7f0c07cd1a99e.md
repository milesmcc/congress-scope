Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1538, Wounded 
Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting in favor of it.

I support H.R. 1538 because I believe our men and women in uniform 
who have served our country deserve the best possible care when they 
return home. The conditions that were recently uncovered at Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center were disturbing and unacceptable. In addition, 
thousands of soldiers are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and we 
need to further improve the conditions of the Department of Defense and 
Veterans Administration health care systems in order to meet this need. 
As the Representative for Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base, and as a 
veteran myself, I have always made the needs of our soldiers and 
veteran and their families high on the priority list.

H.R. 1538 is a bipartisan bill that improves the lives of our 
veterans in several ways. This legislation will improve the access to 
quality medical care for service members who are outpatients at 
military health care facilities, restore efficiency to the disability 
evaluation system, and streamline the transition of wounded service 
members from the Armed Forces to the Veterans Administration. By 
establishing a system or patient advocates and independent medical 
advocates, and improving the system of case managers for wounded 
service members, H.R. 1538 makes sure that veterans are getting the 
care that they need. In addition, this bill improves training and 
reduces caseloads for these managers so that service members and their 
families can get more individual attention. Finally, H.R. 1538 
establishes a national toll-free hotline so that service members and 
families have a mechanism for


reporting problems and deficiencies in their treatment.

I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1538, Wounded 
Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, and improving the quality of care for 
our Nation's veterans.
