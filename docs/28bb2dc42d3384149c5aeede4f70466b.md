Ms. LEE of California. I rise in strong support of this amendment. 
Let me commend my colleague from Massachusetts for his consistent and 
his bold leadership.

This amendment does not call for the redeployment of U.S. Armed 
Forces out of Afghanistan. It does not call for an end of the funding 
requested by the administration for military operations. It does not 
tie the hands of the President, commanders in the field, or our troops 
on the ground. And it does not provide aid or comfort to those who 
would harm us or wish us ill.

Instead, this will provide a vital contingency plan for withdrawing 
United States military forces from Afghanistan.

Mr. Chairman, most recognize that there is no military solution to 
the quagmire in Afghanistan. I remain convinced that the United States 
must develop an exit strategy in Afghanistan before further committing 
the United States' limited resources and military personnel deeper into 
Afghanistan in pursuit of an objective that may be unattainable, 
unrealistic, or too costly. Unfortunately, we're digging ourselves 
deeper in a hole.

In 2001, I voted against the authorization to use force because I 
feared that given a blank check to wage war, I really worried that this 
would be for an unspecified period of time, really for an unspecified 
mission. This blank check continues today. My worst fears have been 
realized.

And so what Mr. McGovern is doing makes a lot of sense. We need an 
exit strategy for Afghanistan now. I urge my colleagues to vote for 
this amendment. Otherwise, this blank check is going to continue.

This does not enhance the national security of the United States of 
America. The longer we're there, the worse things get for our troops. 
Our troops deserve to be able to know at least what our plans are, what 
they're going to entail, and when in fact they will come out of 
Afghanistan. The people of Afghanistan deserve to know this.

I commend our President for trying to develop a new direction in our 
policy, but I have to tell you, putting more troops in harm's way is 
not going to help us begin to develop an exit strategy out.

So, thank you, Mr. McGovern, and thank all of the cosponsors for 
making sure that we have at least an opportunity to say: No more blank 
checks.
