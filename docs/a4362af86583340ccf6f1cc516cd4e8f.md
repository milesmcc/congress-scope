Ms. HOOLEY. I thank my colleague.

Mr. Speaker, today is not cause for celebration, nor is it a time for 
high rhetoric. Instead, today is a moment of conscience. Hundreds of 
billions of dollars have been spent, 3,600 of our best and brightest 
have been called upon to sacrifice in the unforgiving sands of Iraq.

When in a hole, it is best to stop digging. We must make plans to 
protect those we can best protect, to institute a rational response 
capability


within the region. But first we must make immediate plans to disengage 
ourselves from Iraq.

I urge my colleagues to find consensus on this issue. We owe it to 
the brave men and women that have sacrificed and will continue to 
sacrifice until we find and implement resolution.

Once we have disengaged ourselves from the Iraqi civil war, maybe, 
with patience, dialogue and an open ear, we may find new relationships 
within the Middle East to help our partners secure the peace we have 
thus far found so elusive.

Let us renew our commitment to finding a solution for Middle East 
conflict. It is time we used our heads and hearts rather than fists and 
force.

I urge my colleagues to join me in voting once again for changing 
course in Iraq.
