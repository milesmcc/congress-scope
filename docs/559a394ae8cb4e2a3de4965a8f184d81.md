Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairman, first, let me thank the gentleman from 
Texas, Chairman Silvestre Reyes, for


the hard work that he did on this bill. So I rise today in strong 
support of the Intelligence Authorization Act.

From my perspective as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, it's 
a good bill, one that will support the intelligence needs of our 
soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. Every day, American men and 
women who are deployed into harm's way depend on the intelligence 
capabilities authorized by this bill to achieve their missions. I 
cannot state strongly enough about how those in uniform who are in 
harm's way depend upon the intelligence that they receive.

This legislation ensures continued delivery of quality intelligence 
products and capabilities through our warfighters. It will lead to 
important improvement in the future.

As I've said before, the relationship between the intelligence 
community and the Department of Defense is fundamental to the success 
on the battlefield. This bill strengthens the relationship by expanding 
the intelligence community's technical and human collection 
capabilities.

It adds significant resources to modernize signals intelligence 
capabilities, and other cutting-edge technologies that are the 
foundation for intelligence support for our warfighters in Afghanistan. 
The bill also adds resources for HUMINT collection against terrorists 
and other enduring and emerging global security issues in Asia, Africa, 
as well as in Latin America.

This measure will improve oversight of the intelligence community by 
creating a statutory and independent intelligence community-wide 
inspector general.

And, finally, this bill enhances cybersecurity, which is becoming 
very, very important, cybersecurity efforts by authorizing significant 
investments to support the President's comprehensive cybersecurity 
strategy.

I congratulate Chairman Reyes on bringing this bill to the floor and 
urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very, very important 
measure.

And I might add, Madam Chairman, that we, on the Armed Services 
Committee, have dealt with some, and have the jurisdiction of dealing 
with some, matters that my friend from Michigan mentioned a few moments 
ago. They are within our jurisdiction.
