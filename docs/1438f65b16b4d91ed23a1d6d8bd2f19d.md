Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, President Bush's plan to escalate the 
war in Iraq will not bring success in Iraq or make America more secure. 
It faces significant bipartisan opposition in both Chambers of 
Congress, and the plan is opposed by a majority of people in our 
country.

The American people rightfully want to know where their leaders stand 
on this critical issue, and the House is prepared to act. 
Unfortunately, on the other side of the Capitol, Senate Republicans 
blocked debate on this critical issue, and the House is prepared to do 
it now.

While Senate Republicans cut and ran from this most important issue, 
over the next 4 days this House will debate, and then on Friday vote on 
a resolution on the President's plan to escalate the war.

Mr. Speaker, House Democrats will ask the tough questions about the 
President's new strategy and continue to insist on a new direction, 
while always putting our troops first.

The days of rubber-stamping the President's war plans are over. And 
starting today, this House is going to have an important debate on the 
President's troop escalation plan.
