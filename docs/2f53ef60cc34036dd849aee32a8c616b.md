## `2f53ef60cc34036dd849aee32a8c616b`
`Mr. SCHUMER â€” 24 May 2007`

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am entering this statement in the 
Record because I am attending my daughter's graduation baccalaureate 
service in New York. Had I been here I would have voted in favor of the 
supplemental appropriations bill because I believe we must fund the 
troops who are in harm's way. However, I believe just as strongly that 
we must change our mission in Iraq away from policing a civil war and 
toward a much more narrowly focused goal of counterterrorism, which 
requires a much smaller number of troops. That is what the Feingold-
Reid amendment stood for and that is why I voted for it on May 16, 
2007. Unfortunately, it did not have enough votes to pass. Our effort 
to force the President to change the mission in Iraq will continue 
almost immediately with the DOD authorization bill and will not end 
until we succeed.
