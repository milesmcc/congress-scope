# IT'S TIME FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT TO REMOVE THE SECRECY

`Mr. YARMUTH â€” 26 June 2007`

Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, over the last 7 years, Dick Cheney has 
convinced himself that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11, that Iraq 
had weapons of mass destruction and that the insurgency was in its last 
throes. Now it seems he's convinced himself that he is not actually 
Vice President, insisting that he, unlike the previous 44, is not a 
member of the executive branch.

It's difficult for any American who's taken seventh grade civics to 
miss the hypocrisy of this claim, especially when it comes from a man 
who so frequently has withheld information from Congress based on the 
assertion of executive privilege.

It's time for the Vice President to remove the secrecy, reject 
hypocrisy, and honor his pledge to support the Constitution. It's time 
for Dick Cheney to start respecting the citizens who pay


his salary and start leveling with us. Even a child can tell you, you 
can have special privileges if you obey the rules, and even the Vice 
President can't have it both ways.

Many of us wish you weren't part of the executive branch, Mr. Vice 
President, but so long as you accept the executive perks, we will 
demand executive responsibility and accountability.
