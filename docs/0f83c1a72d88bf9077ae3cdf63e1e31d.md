Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, while our Nation and our military are 
paying a huge price for the continuing war in Iraq, the Iraqi 
Government itself refuses to take any steps needed to bring about 
political reconciliation. It has now been more than 320 days since the 
surge began. During that time, more than 860 American troops have been 
killed and we continue to spend more than $10 billion in Iraq every 
month; yet the Iraqi Government still refuses to live up to the 
promises it made to President Bush when the surge began.

The government promised that the Iraqi Parliament would pass a 
national oil and gas bill. It hasn't.

The Iraqi Government also promised the President that its parliament 
would pass a de-Baathification law. It hasn't.

The government also promised to hold provincial elections. Once 
again, they have failed to follow through.

Madam Speaker, how much longer is President Bush going to sacrifice 
both our military and our Treasury for an Iraqi Government that refuses 
to make the difficult decisions that could possibly produce real 
stability in Iraq? It's time for a change of course in Iraq.
