`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 25 September 2008`

---


Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of our 
bravest warriors who gave his life to defend us. U.S. Marine Corps CPT 
Eric D. Terhune of Lexington, KY, was conducting a security patrol in 
the Farah Province of Afghanistan on June 19, 2008, when he was killed 
by enemy small-arms fire. He was 34 years old.

For his heroism in service, Captain Terhune received several awards, 
medals and decorations, including the Strike/Flight Air Medal, the 
Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, two National Defense Service Medals 
and the Armed Forces Service Medal.

Those who knew Captain Terhune would describe him as a man committed 
to serving his country and proud to wear the uniform. In fact, as his 
uncle, David Terhune, puts it, since Eric was born in a Naval hospital 
in Quantico, VA, where his father was on active duty, ''Eric was born a 
Marine.''

Eric was also committed to his faith. When family members expressed 
worry about his dangerous job, he told them, ''If I live, it's 
wonderful. But if I die, it's absent from the body and present with the 
Lord.''

Eric was raised in Lexington, attended Tates Creek Presbyteria Church 
and studied at Wheaton Academy in Wheaton, IL. As a kid he was active 
in everything from Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting to soccer and Little 
League baseball.

Eric was also a competitive swimmer who loved to hunt and scuba dive. 
As a marine, he would dive to collect shells and sharks' teeth in the 
many places the Corps sent him.

Once on a sail boat trip with his family, when it was Eric's turn to 
do the dishes after dinner, he came up with a creative cleaning 
method--he threw them in the ocean, put on his scuba gear, and 
retrieved the dishes from the water.

Upon high school graduation, Eric enlisted in the same branch his 
father and grandfather had once served in, the Marine Corps. After 4 
years as a noncommissioned officer and a reconnaissance sharpshooter, 
Eric dreamt of becoming a Naval aviator like his dad.

This required a college degree. So with some encouragement from his 
grandparents, Daniel and Joy Terhune, he used his GI bill benefits to 
enroll at Morehead State University.

At Morehead, Eric made the honor roll and competed on the varsity 
rifle team. ''There [was] no doubt . . . when Eric turned in his 
targets from a rifle match, who pulled the trigger,'' his uncle David 
says. ''He was an expert sharpshooter.''

Upon graduation, Eric received his commission as a second lieutenant 
in the Marine Corps. He then spent a year at Naval Air Station 
Pensacola and earned his coveted wings of gold.

Eric flew the CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter during his first tour in 
Iraq. His friends in the Corps nicknamed him ''D-Ring,'' after the D-
ring located overhead in the helicopters he flew to be pulled in case 
of emergency.

His fellow marines spoke highly of Eric. His commanding officer, LTC 
Richard D. Hall, says,




 ''D-Ring,'' as we all affectionately called him, and [as] 


 was his aviator's call-sign, was a Marine that everyone 


 liked; and I mean everybody. He had a gracious and kind 


 personality that was truly infectious; so much so, that I too 


 became infected by his wonderful persona.


MAJ Darby Wiler was Eric's staff platoon commander at The Basic 
School, where newly commissioned marine officers are sent for weapons, 
tactical, and leadership training. Major Wiler says, ''Eric's work 
ethic was unparalleled amongst his peers.

''Even in the midst of the most unpleasant circumstances that The 
Basic School had to offer, he was always upbeat, motivated, and ready 
to go,'' the major adds.

Eric volunteered for a second tour of Iraq, which he completed last 
November. When his ship, the U.S.S. Denver, arrived in Pearl Harbor, he 
was allowed to give one family member the honor of joining him and his 
crew for the final leg of the voyage home to San Diego. Eric chose his 
grandfather.

''That trip halfway across the Pacific Ocean together, eating 
together in the ward room, watching ships operations from the bridge, 
showing his grandfather how to shoot an M-16, how to shoot a .50 
Caliber machine gun . . . this was the greatest of bonding experiences 
for both of them,'' says Eric's uncle David.

''Eric has told me many times what a blast it was to share those days 
with Dad. For Dad, it was an indescribable joy to see his grandson 
performing as a Marine and standing tall as a Christian officer.''

After his two tours in Iraq, Eric expected to return to training to 
requalify as a helicopter pilot. But then he learned the Marine Corps 
was short of forward air controllers--an important position, 
responsible for directing other aircraft in close air support and 
requiring substantial experience.

''He had a lot of conversations with his dad--'What do you think 
about this Afghanistan thing?' '' David recalls. ''His dad laid out the 
pros and cons, and Eric said, 'Look, if you're in the Marine Corps, you 
don't duck the fight.'

Eric volunteered and was deployed to Afghanistan in April of this 
year with the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, 
I Marine Expeditionary Force, based out of Twentynine Palms, CA.

''We have heard numerous reports of him volunteering to take the 
place of some of his friends who had a wife and children,'' David says.

Eric brought the same work ethic he carried with him throughout his 
career to Afghanistan. CPT Carlos R. Cuevas who served alongside Eric 
in Afghanistan, remembers when he first met Eric.

''I believe the first thing he asked me was, 'Hey, Captain Cuevas, 
can you tell me where the armory is and who I need to talk to get my 
weapon?' '' the captain remembers. ''As a fellow captain and Marine . . 
. I can tell you his professionalism and enthusiasm for his job was 
readily apparent,'' the captain says.

''He loved being a pilot, a Marine, and most of all serving alongside 
his fellow Marines.''

Eric couldn't write or call his family often from Afghanistan, but 
they were always happy when he did. On June 16 he sent what would be 
his final e-mail.

''He wrote and addressed each of his cousins by name, encouraging 
them, affirming them, giving advice to them,'' says David. ''And [he] 
expressed his longing to join us at our next family gathering.''

Three days after that e-mail, Mr. President, Eric was killed. And 
although nothing we say here today can alleviate the pain of his 
family, I know my colleagues join me in expressing our deepest 
sympathies to them for their tragic loss.

We are thinking of Eric's father and stepmother Paul and Carleen 
Terhune; his grandparents Daniel and Joy Terhune; his uncle and aunt 
David and Dotti Terhune; many beloved family members, including Dr. and 
Mrs. Oliver Jeromin, Dr. and Mrs. Richard Colquitt, David W. Terhune, 
Jr., Rebecca Joy Terhune, Bea Hansgen, and many others.

I will leave the final words to Eric's uncle David, who describes his 
nephew this way. Eric ''was, in the best sense of the word, an officer 
and a gentleman and a patriot,'' David says. ''I always admired his 
strength and his power, but he was also gentle at the same time.''

Mr. President, this U.S. Senate honors CPT Eric D. Terhune as an 
officer, a gentleman, and a patriot. We are grateful for his years of 
service to our Nation and his great sacrifice. And we send our profound 
thanks to the Terhune family for giving their country this heroic 
marine. It is only by men such as he that every American can stand tall 
and free.
