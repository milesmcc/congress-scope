`Mr. PUTNAM â€” 6 May 2010`

---


Mr. PUTNAM. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize an exemplary 
federal employee from my district, Frank Calestino. Representing the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury, Mr. Calestino works as the Deputy 
Director of Intelligence for the Afghan Threat Finance Cell. This is a 
unique, interagency effort to disrupt the flow of funding from the 
Afghan opium trade and other terrorist resources. Afghanistan poses a 
unique threat to our national security and it will take more than 
military presence to stabilize the region.

The nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service declared 
Mr. Calestino to be one of 32 finalists for the prestigious Service to 
America Medals--or Sammies--in 2010. These awards are granted to 
outstanding federal employees who have made significant contributions 
to our nation.

Final selection of eight candidates will be made on September 15, and 
will also include the Partnership for Public Service's announcement of 
the Federal Employee of the Year. I am very proud to call Mr. Calestino 
one of my constituents and I wish him the best of luck in the final 
announcement and all of his future endeavors.
