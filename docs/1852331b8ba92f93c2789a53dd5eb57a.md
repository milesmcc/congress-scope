Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I thank Congresswoman Schakowsky for her 
leadership on this amendment--and on the many issues surrounding 
private contractors.

Mr. Chair, this amendment is all about accountability and stopping 
waste, fraud and abuse. It's long past time that we increased and 
improved the monitoring and oversight of private contractors, 
especially military, defense and security contractors.

This amendment, like the provision in my bill, H.R. 5015, places 
these contractors under the audit and review of our existing Inspectors 
General, and allows the Special IG for Reconstruction in Afghanistan to 
make concrete recommendations to the Pentagon, State Department and 
USAID on how to bring to account and even stop doing business with 
those contractors with records of waste, fraud and abuse--let alone a 
record of abusing and killing innocent civilians.

Mr. Chair, this amendment is good for the American taxpayer. It's 
good for our national security. And it's good for our reputation and 
standing abroad.

It is a win-win amendment.

I ask my colleagues to support the Schakowsky-McGovern-Hinchey-
Conyers-Moran amendment on expanding the oversight over and 
accountability of private contractors in Afghanistan.
