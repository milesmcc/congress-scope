Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the 
accomplishments of the Kansas Air National Guard, and specifically of 
the 190th Air Refueling Wing.

I have made several statements on the floor recently regarding my 
feelings on these resolutions. And today, instead of repeating my 
feelings on the subject, I would like to acknowledge some of our 
country's brave men and women.

As we all know, our Nation has been relying heavily on our National 
Guard in the war on terror. In Kansas, it is no different. However, 
these men and women continually rise to the challenge, saving lives and 
defending democracy at home and abroad.

Next week, we commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the 190th Air 
Refueling Wing in Kansas. The enormous sacrifice and dedication of the 
men and women serving in 190th brings great credit to their unit and to 
the State of Kansas.

This outstanding organization began as the 117th Fighter-Interceptor 
Squadron in Hutchinson, KS. The unit was federally recognized on 
February 23, 1957.

Next week they will celebrate 50 years of flying aircraft--from the 
F-80 to the B-57 to the KC-135 tankers they maintain today.

Since 1967, the 190th has been based in our State capital of Topeka, 
KS. They continue to be leaders in the State and in the Air National 
Guard, which is evident through their most recent awards--the Spaatz 
trophy for outstanding Air National Guard Flying Wing and the Air Force 
Outstanding Unit Award.

As we continue to debate the difficult topic of our presence in Iraq, 
I hope my colleagues will take a moment to recognize, with me, the 
outstanding contributions of our Nation's troops. Not only has our 
volunteer force proven themselves the best in the world, our citizen 
soldiers have proven themselves second to none.

I hope we will remember the personal sacrifices of these men and 
women as we debate our support for them and their mission.
