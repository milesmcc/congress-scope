Ms. WOOLSEY. First, I would like to thank the Congresswoman from 
California for her leadership tonight with this special order and also 
her leadership of the Out of Iraq Caucus.

I will echo, to save time, every single word that has come out of the 
mouths of my colleagues this evening. But there is one thing we have 
not talked about that, every single time I am interviewed, somebody 
says: But Congresswoman, what will happen to the Iraqi people if the 
United States leaves?

My answer is asking them a question right back: Have you not paid 
attention to what is happening to the Iraqi people right now with our 
very presence?

It is my opinion, and my belief, and I know that I am right, when the 
United States Army military leaves Iraq, the insurgency will calm down. 
The United States then is responsible to work internationally to help 
Iraq rebuild its country, invest in its infrastructure, invest in its 
economy, invest in its education and help their people with getting 
their feet back on the ground.

And I will end by just saying this. The United States is not going to 
determine the fate of Iraq. Only the Iraqis will determine their fate.
