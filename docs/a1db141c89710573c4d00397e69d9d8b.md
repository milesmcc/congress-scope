Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, as your Congressman, I'd like to share with 
you the difficult reality our Nation faces in the religious civil war 
in Iraq. The truth is things are bad in Iraq and getting worse--with no 
end in sight.

After 4 years of conflict, with more than 3,400 courageous American 
soldiers dead--and counting--with more than 650,000 civilians killed, 
and after spending billions and billions of our hard-earned tax dollars 
on private no-bid contractors, the Iraqi government is still not 
standing up to help themselves.

I was shocked to learn that /1/3/ of the elected Iraqi government 
does not even live in Iraq--they live in London, England--even as our 
own children are being killed in their centuries-old religious civil 
war. And their parliament, well, in the middle of a war--they're about 
to take a 2-month vacation--even as our children continue to make the 
ultimate sacrifice.

Unfortunately, today's vote cannot, and will not, end this war, 
because we do not have enough democratic votes to overcome the 
president's veto. And make no mistake--Iraq is President Bush's war--
and he is the only one, today, who can stop it.

The current commander of our forces in Iraq told Congress the civil 
war in Iraq cannot be won militarily--it can only end with a political 
solution, not a military one.

I have been working hard to find a way home for our troops, and I 
have supported every effort to improve the safety and readiness of our 
soldiers, to guarantee they receive expert medical care when they come 
home, to increase their pay, and to deploy our forces away from Iraq--
and back after al Qaeda. But, the President vetoed, or threatened to 
veto, all of our attempts to support our troops. In my opinion, the 
President is unable to see and hear the realities on the ground in 
Iraq. Plainly put, Congress cannot follow a President with poor 
judgement--period. Enough is enough.

I have been listening to many Wisconsin veterans at the American 
Legion, the veterans of foreign wars, and to parents and grandparents 
of fallen soldiers. Military veterans from Appleton to Green Bay, from 
Ashwaubenon to Pulaski, and from Waupaca, Clintonville, Shawano and 
Marinette have shared their feelings with me.

Please, just for a moment, listen to their heartfelt thoughts:

''We need to get our boys home.''

''We went in with not enough troops.''

''It is just like Vietnam.''

''This war can never be won--we don't belong there.''

''We all back our troops--but not this dumb policy.''

''Our President has a complete disregard for humanity.''

''We need a President who really believes in diplomacy.''

''The President will not listen to ordinary people, and he does not 
understand when he is wrong.''

Today, I voted to support our troops by protecting them from a 
President who cannot understand reality. I support our troops, but not 
this failed policy.

Finally, allow me to share with you the pain of a grandmother whose 
grandson perished in Iraq: ''Oh, Steve. It is so hard to talk about. He 
was such a bright young man. He wanted a college education and was 
going to use the money he was being paid to go to school.

Where is this war getting us? We got Saddam. Let's bring our military 
home.

I have another grandson ready to go over to Iraq. Let the higher-ups 
send their kids to Iraq. I don't want to see it happen to anyone else. 
Enough is enough.''

And remember this: The vote today was not about ending the Iraqi 
civil war. it was about supporting our troops by protecting them from a 
President who cannot understand reality. Congress cannot continue to 
give a loaded gun to a President with poor judgement. I will always 
support our troops, but not this failed policy. I believe there is a 
better way to do things in America. By working together, we will find 
it as we build a better and more secure nation for all of us.

Thank you for listening, and God Bless America.
