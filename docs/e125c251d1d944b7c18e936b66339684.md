Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I request the House's attention 
today to recognize a heroic American, Captain Donnie R. Belser, Jr., 
28, of Anniston, Alabama, who died in Iraq on February 10, 2007. 
Captain Belser was assigned to the 425th Military Transition Team, 1st 
Infantry Division, Fort Riley, Kansas, and according to initial reports 
was killed during an exchange of small arms fire.

Words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family, and 
the gratitude our country feels for his service. Captain Belser died 
serving the United States and the entire cause of liberty, on a mission 
to bring stability to a troubled region and liberty to a formerly 
oppressed people. Captain Belser was a true patriot indeed.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve.
