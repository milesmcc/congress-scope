Mr. GREGG. My first two questions were sort of to lay the predicate 
for this question, which is that the other side of the aisle has spent 
a lot of time saying the minority is obstructing, the Republicans are 
obstructing. Yet was it not by conscious choice that they decided to 
create a legislative calendar which was totally dominated by their 
desire to make political points over the issue of how the war in Iraq 
was proceeding rather than to take up the appropriations bills, which 
are the proper order of the Congress, one of the first responsibilities 
of the Congress? The Republican side of the aisle has not resisted 
going to appropriations bills; it has been the other side of the aisle 
which has refused to bring them up.

So this allegation of obstruction is really a bit of a straw dog, is 
it not? Are they not in the position of basically having created the 
problem and then trying to claim the problem is created by us when, in 
fact, the problem was created by the fact that they refused to take up 
the business of the Government, and now, in the 11th hour 49th minute, 
they have decided to turn to the business of the Government and they 
have chaos on their hands as a result of their own management?
