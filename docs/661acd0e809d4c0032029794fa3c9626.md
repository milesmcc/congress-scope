`Mr. SESSIONS â€” 1 March 2007`

---


Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to take a personal moment 
to express my deepest gratitude and bid farewell to my senior defense 
policy analyst, Archie Galloway.

For the past 10 years, Archie has dedicated his time, energy and 
skill to assisting me but more importantly to assisting America and the 
citizens of Alabama. He has been a friend and an asset to the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, and his performance stands as a tribute to 
the professionalism of our military community. Archie leaves us to join 
the private sector, but our Nation will continue to benefit from his 
many contributions for many years.

I congratulate Arch on his bright future but with a heavy heart. His 
experience as a battle-tested Army officer, Ranger, and 101st Airborne 
Screaming


Eagle, combined with his in-depth knowledge of the workings of Capitol 
Hill, cannot be matched. Upon joining my team, he quickly became a 
pillar in my office. His undeniable work ethic and his unwavering 
dedication to our country and to my State of Alabama were a great 
example to his fellow staffers.

As my senior defense policy analyst, I have relied on Archie's 
experience and sound judgment. In the last 10 years, he has been 
instrumental in the passage of key legislation, such as the HEROES Act 
that Senator Lieberman and I cosponsored--I believe the Senator was 
here a moment ago--that doubled the death benefits provided to the 
families of those who lost a servicemember in combat. Alabama's success 
in the recent Base Realignment and Closure round reflected so much of 
his hard work. The footprints of his dedication to the needs of this 
Nation and to the State of Alabama are deep and permanent as he moves 
on to his next journey in life.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the other half of the Galloway 
team. Archie's wife Carol is a tremendous contributor to his success. 
We will always be impressed by the strength of their partnership and 
the heart and soul they put into everything they do together.

On behalf of myself, my staff, and the people of Alabama, the 
military community, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the entire 
country, may I say thank you to Colonel Archie Galloway.

During these 10 years, Archie has won the admiration and respect of 
everyone he has worked with. Many have sent their regards, so I thought 
I would quote a few.

Charlie Able, former Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and 
Readiness and the former Armed Services Committee staff director had 
this to say:




 Archie is a professional soldier and a dedicated Senate 


 staffer who cares deeply about soldiers and their families. 


 It's equally important to recognize his wife Carol for her 


 dedication and service. This partnership is truly their best 


 asset.


Les Brownlee, the former Senate Armed Services Committee staff 
director and Under Secretary of the Army had this to say:




 Archie wore the uniform of a soldier and brought all of 


 that wonderful experience to the U.S. Senate, where it has 


 been invaluable to Senator Sessions, the Army, and the 


 Nation.


Here are the words of General Cody, Vice Chief of Staff of the United 
States Army:




 Archie Galloway is a patriot in every sense of the word. 


 His commitment to this Nation and the Army has not faltered 


 through 40 years of service. In and out of uniform, Archie 


 has dedicated his life to taking care of the soldiers that 


 defend our freedoms. Although Arch will be missed, he can 


 take great pride in knowing the indelible impact he has made 


 will continue to save lives, strengthen our national 


 security, and protect the liberties from which we all 


 benefit. Thank you for your service Arch, Army Strong!


Dick Walsh, senior member of the Armed Services Committee, writes on 
behalf of the Armed Services Committee and their team:




 There aren't many people working on Capitol Hill these days 


 who have served in the Armed Forces, and among those, there 


 are even fewer who--like Arch Galloway--served over 20 years 


 on active duty, commanded troops, and achieved the rank of 


 Colonel in the United States Army. We have been fortunate to 


 have Arch working issues in support of Senator Sessions on 


 behalf of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and working 


 for the people of our country. Whether he learned it from his 


 parents or whether he learned it in the Army, Archie brought 


 the qualities of common sense, good judgment, commitment to 


 duty, honor, and country, wisdom and an inherent 


 understanding of how to get things done the right way in the 


 U.S. Senate. Archie helped us all see each day that the Army 


 is an institution we all have to listen to, support, and 


 advocate for. Any outfit that keeps someone like Arch for a 


 career and then hands him off to more public service is doing 


 something right. No one was able to send a message of 


 appreciation and thanks for support and a job well done with 


 a plate of delicious cookies better than Archie Galloway, and 


 we thank Carol Galloway for her contributions as Archie's G4 


 to committee morale. Archie like few others understands the 


 ''force multiplier'' effect of baked goods. All part of being 


 a great leader. The staff of the Senate Armed Services 


 Committee relies greatly on the military legislative 


 assistants who work for our Senators and those who have the 


 kind of experience and qualities that Arch possesses 


 represent a tremendous resource. They are full partners with 


 the committee staff. We are sad to see Archie leave, and he 


 will be missed, but we are very grateful for his friendship 


 and service.


Rob Soofer, the chief staffer for the minority side on the Strategic 
Forces Subcommittee says:




 Most legislative assistants view their primary 


 responsibility as supporting the Senator's interests in 


 the State. While Archie was indeed a forceful advocate for 


 defense interests in Alabama, he never lost sight of the 


 broader national security interests and the role Senator 


 Sessions played as chairman of the Strategic Forces 


 Subcommittee. As the liaison between the committee staff 


 and the Senator, he made sure the Senator was prepared to 


 chair subcommittee hearings and address critical strategic 


 force issues during the preparation and passage of the 


 National Defense Authorization Act.


John Little, now the chief of staff for Senator Martinez, a former 
staffer in my office, said this:




 I cannot say enough about Archie Galloway. It was my honor 


 to work with him for 8 years. I have never worked with 


 someone who is more honest, sincere and dedicated. As a 


 native of Alabama, I know how much he has done for my State. 


 America is truly stronger for his service to our Nation. I 


 wish him and Carol much happiness and the best of luck as he 


 embarks on his new professional career. I am very glad that I 


 can call him my friend.


Here are some comments from those with whom he has worked. Rick 
Dearborn, the Chief of Staff in my office, says:




 If James Brown was known as the hardest working man in show 


 business, Arch Galloway should be known as the ''hardest 


 working military legislative assistant on the Hill.'' The 


 focus that Arch has placed on men and women in uniform over 


 10 years, particularly those who served in the State of 


 Alabama, was a tribute to his country and the man who 


 represents them. I know of no one who has worked harder, put 


 in more hours, more thought and sweat than Archie Galloway on 


 behalf of the men and women in uniform and in the name of 


 national security.


Major Shannon Sentell, former military fellow in my office, back now 
on active duty, said:




 Be it the soldier in the field, the constituent in need of 


 assistance, or the numerous relationships he has on the Hill, 


 Archie Galloway always gave 110 percent in making sure the 


 welfare of those individuals and groups was taken care of. 


 His untiring efforts and tenacious attitude made Arch the 


 ''go-to'' man when a lot of heavy lifting was needed. On a 


 personal note, I refer to him as my colleague, my mentor, but 


 most of all, my friend. Thank you, Arch, for what you do on a 


 daily basis. You have made an incredible difference in so 


 many lives. You will be sorely missed.


Meagan Myers, who now works under Colonel Galloway on my staff, said 
this:




 Though he would never admit it, Arch is my father figure in 


 Washington, D.C. I have truly never learned so much about 


 life from one individual. To call him my mentor would be an 


 understatement at best. Although I will miss Arch in the 


 office, I look forward to his success in the private sector.


Watson Donald, who also worked under Archie Galloway and is now the 
military legislative assistant for Congressman Jo Bonner, said:




 Archie Galloway is one of the most dedicated, hard-working, 


 loyal, intelligent people I know. His decade-long service to 


 Alabama has been invaluable and I know our entire 


 congressional delegation will miss his defense-related 


 expertise. Having worked for him personally for 3 years, I am 


 proud to have him not only as a professional mentor, but as a 


 friend.


Leroy Nix, who also worked under Arch and is now in law school said:




 I would simply like to express my gratitude to Colonel 


 Galloway for his tireless commitment to excellence and the 


 service of the people of Alabama and this Nation. Having 


 worked with Arch in Senator Sessions' office for the better 


 part of 3 years, I had the luxury of learning from him, not 


 just the finer points of professionalism and personal 


 development, but also those things that I feel will continue 


 to influence the man I am and the man I strive to be. My only 


 hope is that more people, young and old, could have such a 


 fine teacher, mentor, and most importantly, friend.


John Muller, current military fellow and major in the Army says:




 Archie is a true patriot and a great mentor. He shows you 


 the way and gives you the freedom to work the issues, but he 


 will not let you fail.


Stephen Boyd--LA, Sessions staffer said:




 I've had the very good fortune to work about 10 feet from 


 Arch Galloway, day in and day out, for several years now. 


 It's given me a deep respect for all he has done behind the 


 scenes for Senator Sessions and for the State of Alabama. 


 When I came to Washington fresh from law school, I was long 


 on eagerness but short on experience. It didn't take




 me long to realize that Arch Galloway, more than any other, 


 knew exactly what he was doing in this town. I decided early 


 on to use Arch's attitude, style, and work ethic as a model 


 for my own, and I think that is one of the best decisions I 


 have ever made. His guidance has never let me down.


Mike Brumas, press secretary, Senator Sessions, said:




 the use of use of superlatives is all too common these 


 days. But someone trying to describe Arch Galloway's 10-year 


 tenure on Capitol Hill is forced to reach for the highest of 


 accolades--best, brightest, consummate professional, hardest 


 worker. Arch Galloway brought the can-do spirit of a 


 distinguished military career to Senator Sessions's office, 


 and we all benefited by his example. He will be hard to 


 replace and is already missed.


Madam President, I have had the opportunity to travel to Iraq on more 
than one occasion with Colonel Galloway. He is more than an employee in 
my office. He is a friend and a partner in service to our country. His 
career was exceptional in the Army on active duty. His service in my 
office has been exceptional. No one on the Hill, I think, is more 
respected than Archie Galloway for his hard work and professionalism. I 
am going to miss him. Our country is going to miss him.

I don't do this often, but I think on very special occasions, those 
who serve this Senate exceedingly well deserve a few moments of 
mention. I think it is true for Archie Galloway. I think all of us 
appreciate our staff members. So many serve in so many superb ways, but 
I have to tell my colleagues, this one was special. I am really going 
to miss him. I wish he and Carol every success. He has been a partner, 
a friend, and a patriot in his service to America.

I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.
