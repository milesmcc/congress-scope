Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I Rise today to honor the courage of a 
brave and dedicated hero of the Fort Worth community and of our Nation.

Specialist Lance C. Springer II was a United States Army soldier and 
a true american hero who gallantly and selflessly gave his life for his 
country on March 23, 2007, during combat operations in Baghdad, Iraq.

Lance--or Craig as his family and friends called him, enlisted during 
time of war, which speaks volumes about his character and patriotism.

Assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, Craig's service as a field 
medic, placing the well-being of others ahead of his own, exemplifies 
the type of selfless and caring man that he was.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Craig's parents and all of his 
family and friends.

Our community and Nation honor Specialist Springer's memory and we 
are grateful for his faithful and distinguished service to America.

Specialist Craig Springer will not be forgotten. His memory lives on 
through his family and the legacy of selfless service that he so 
bravely imprinted on our hearts.
