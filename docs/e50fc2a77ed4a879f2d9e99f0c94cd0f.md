# MILITARY LEADERS' LETTER TO CONGRESS
## `e50fc2a77ed4a879f2d9e99f0c94cd0f`
`Mr. BERMAN â€” 22 March 2010`

---


Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to submit this letter signed 
by 48 retired four- and three-star generals/flag officers urging 
Congress to support the President's FY11 International Affairs Budget 
request--given its importance to U.S. national security. These military 
leaders state that ''balancing our military power with the range of 
International Affairs programs funded by the International Affairs 
Budget is critical to stabilizing fragile states, combating terrorism, 
and deterring


threats before they reach America's shores.'' I couldn't agree more, 
and appreciate the hard work that these signatories and the U.S. Global 
Leadership Coalition have done to support our international affairs 
budget.


























 March 10, 2010.



 Dear Member of Congress: As retired officers of the U.S. 


 military across all branches of the armed services, we are 


 writing to express our support for the President's FY 2011 


 International Affairs Budget request, a fundamental pillar of 


 U.S. national security and foreign policy. The critical 


 programs in the International Affairs Budget invest in the 


 non-military tools of development and diplomacy, foster 


 economic and political stability on a global scale, 


 strengthen our allies, and fight the spread of poverty, 


 disease, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.



 Continuing the bipartisan precedent set by the Bush 


 Administration, the Obama Administration views the 


 International Affairs Budget as part of the national security 


 funding alongside Defense, Homeland Security, Intelligence, 


 and Veterans programs. However, the International Affairs 


 Budget remains underfunded, representing 1.4 percent of the 


 entire federal budget and less than 7 percent of our total 


 national security funding.



 Our view is shared by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who 


 has stated that ''America's civilian institutions of 


 diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned 


 and underfunded for far too long--relative to what we 


 traditionally spend on the military, and more important, 


 relative to the responsibilities and challenges our nation 


 has around the world.'' Secretary Gates and other military 


 leaders believe, as we do, that our national security is 


 dependent not only on a strong military force but also on 


 increased investments in the full range of diplomatic, 


 development and humanitarian tools funded through the 


 International Affairs Budget.



 The United States must combine its strong military with 


 robust, effective civilian tools of international development 


 and diplomacy to secure its national interests in an era when 


 many of the challenges of the 21st century recognize no 


 borders. While our military power can provide the logistics 


 and organizational support to help those in need in times of 


 humanitarian crisis, as demonstrated by our current efforts 


 in Haiti, it can only help create the conditions necessary to 


 allow the other tools of statecraft--our diplomatic, 


 development and humanitarian programs--to effectively address 


 these issues.



 Balancing our military power with the range of 


 International Affairs programs funded by the International 


 Affairs Budget is critical to stabilizing fragile states, 


 combating terrorism, and deterring threats before they reach 


 America's shores. Therefore, we urge you to support no less 


 than the Administration's request of $58.5 billion for the 


 International Affairs Budget.
