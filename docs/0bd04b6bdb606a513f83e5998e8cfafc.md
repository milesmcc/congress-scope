`Mr. REID â€” 5 February 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, keep in mind what I offered the minority: 
up-or-down votes on Warner and McCain; up-or-down vote on Judd Gregg. I 
also offered a 60-vote on Warner and a 60-vote on McCain. That was also 
turned down.

This thing about 60 votes is exaggerated. I have been in the Senate 
25 years. I have been involved in two filibusters, and that is two more 
than most anyone in the Senate has been involved in. Filibusters are 
just talk. Rarely are filibusters ever necessary or do they occur.

Therefore, this ''everything is 60 votes'' is simply not valid.

They want a fair process? Up-or-down vote on McCain, up-or-down vote 
on Warner, up-or-down vote on Judd Gregg. Okay, don't want that? I tell 
you what, this has been stated publicly and privately long before 
today: We will give you a 60-vote on Warner, we will give you a 60-vote 
on McCain. Nope. Turned down.

Where does this fairness come in? Is fairness in the eye of the 
beholder? They have to get everything they want? I cannot imagine how 
we could be more fair. The American public would see a debate on 
Warner, see a debate on McCain. One is for the surge, one is against 
the surge. Why not have that debate? There will be lots of other times 
to debate other issues dealing with Iraq. We have the September 11 
recommendation coming up; we have the supplemental coming up. Iraq is 
not going to leave the Senate. But it will leave this Senate if we are 
not allowed to proceed in this manner because--again I say that is 
because of bad housekeeping and the Republicans just simply leaving 
town after they lost the majority--we have to pass a continuing 
resolution. We have to. We have no alternative. We have to start on 
that by Wednesday.
