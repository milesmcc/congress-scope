Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I think that probably no bill that the House will 
consider this year more aptly demonstrates the divided nature of this 
Congress and this government than does the bill that is before us right 
now. People often say there is not a dime's worth of difference between 
the two political parties. My response, at least on this occasion, is 
you are absolutely right. At least with respect to this legislation, 
there is a $40 billion difference between the two parties. Because when 
you take into account what this Congress did in January when it passed 
the continuing resolution in January, and if you take into account the 
money that has been moved from the President's priorities into 
congressional priorities in this bill, you will see that that amounts 
to almost $40 billion. It is not as much as I would like, but it 
certainly is worth the fight.



So I think there is a very big difference between a Congress run by 
our friends on the other side of the aisle and a Congress run by the 
now-majority Democratic Party.

But I think there is another significant difference, and that is the 
way the two parties have approached the war in Iraq. We have tried 
every way known to man to bring this war to a conclusion. Mr. Murtha 
has produced out of his subcommittee time and time again language 
trying to produce a policy change, and on each occasion, that language 
has either been vetoed by the President or it has been blocked by the 
President through the use of his friends in the other body.

So I think it is clear that if the Nation wants a change in direction 
with respect to this war, it has only two options: Number one is to 
elect more progressive voices in the United States Senate; second is to 
elect a President who has a different set of priorities domestically 
and a different vision for America's involvement in the Middle East and 
especially in Iraq.

This, in my view, is a conscience vote. As it comes down to us at 
this point, we have disposed of all of the domestic issues and we have 
this one remaining issue with respect to Iraq. I would simply say that 
I think we have provided more than enough money for that war.

I would note that earlier today, just a few moments ago, we had some 
64 Members of this House vote against the alternative minimum tax fix 
because it was not paid for, and it added $50 billion to the debt. I 
would point out that the document before us will add $70 billion to 
that debt. And so I would hope that persons who felt it necessary to 
express their concern about the debt a few moments ago would be willing 
to do so on this occasion as well.

I would also point out that Mr. Murtha, Mr. McGovern and I have 
offered this Congress a way to avoid adding to that debt because we 
believe that if this war is such a hot idea, then we ought to at least 
pay for it so we don't shovel yet another bill off on our kids.

It is apparent that this House does not have the will to do that. And 
so not only do I think this is an unnecessary war, it is also an 
unnecessary add-on to the national debt.
