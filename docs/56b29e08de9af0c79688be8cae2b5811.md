Mr. LEVIN. It is our hope to work out an arrangement so we can 
proceed next to the Levin-Reed amendment. If that is the situation, we 
would hope to work out a time agreement as well on that amendment. 
There are two other matters that we may want to try to dispose of--at 
least one other matter--prior to the Levin-Reed amendment. It is our 
hope as well, as the Senator from Arizona expects, that amendments that 
are Iraq related include the 60-vote requirement.
