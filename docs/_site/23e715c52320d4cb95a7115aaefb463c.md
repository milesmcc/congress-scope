`Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky â€” 20 September 2007`

Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to pay 
tribute to one of our Nation's heroes, Staff Sergeant Delmar White. 
Sergeant White lost his life when serving a convoy mission in Baghdad, 
Iraq on September 2, 2007.

Sergeant White was a dedicated soldier and served in the Marine Corps 
in the Persian Gulf War. He had been a member of the Kentucky Army 
National Guard since 1998 and was serving in Iraq with Battery B, 2nd 
Battalion, 138th Field Artillery based in Carlisle, Kentucky.

I recently had the opportunity to visit with Sergeant White's family, 
and his wife conveyed to me that he died for a cause that he truly 
believed in. His fellow officers, noncommissioned officers and soldiers 
told me of a kind and gentle man who was dedicated to the military and 
to his family.

Today, as we honor his memory, our thoughts and prayers turn to his 
wife, Michelle, their two children, Shelby and Seth, and his family and 
friends as they struggle with the loss of this great man.

Our Nation is deeply indebted to Sergeant Delmar White for his 
service, dedication to his mission, and for making the ultimate 
sacrifice.
