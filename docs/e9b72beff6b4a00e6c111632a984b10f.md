Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me express my deep concern 
for the three soldiers who are now missing in Iraq and applaud their 
brothers-in-arms for never giving up on their search, for we as 
Americans will never leave our comrades, our brothers and sisters, in 
battle or never leave them on the battlefield. That is why this 
Congress, with the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, believes that we can 
craft a resolution and a solution, and that is that we begin to 
redeploy our troops and focus on the Iraqi Government, to have them 
stand up and to have them ensure the safety of the Iraqi people and 
also Americans to ensure the safety of their soldiers.

Our soldiers have been successful on the battlefield. They can claim 
victory. It is time now for the President, the White House, the 
leadership to get together and to be able to solve these untenable 
problems.

Why are we allowing our young people to be on the battlefield without 
the support, the full support, of a reasoned White House? Let us work 
together.
