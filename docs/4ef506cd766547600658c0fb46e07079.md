Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers are with the family 
and friends of SSG Chad Caldwell who left this world fighting for 
democracy and peace for the Iraqi people. By all accounts, he loved his 
family and country and served three combat tours to safeguard their 
future.

After graduating from Cheney High School in 2001, Staff Sergeant 
Caldwell joined the Army. The decorated soldier served one tour in 
Iraq, followed by a second combat tour in Afghanistan. In February 
2007, he signed up for a third tour in Iraq. During this time, he 
earned two Army Commendation Medals, including one for saving the life 
of a pregnant woman after the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad was bombed 
in 2003. The second medal was awarded to Staff Sergeant Caldwell for 
saving the life of his lieutenant colonel that was caught in gunfire.

I join Arkansans and Washingtonians in lifting his wife Raechel and 
two young sons, Trevor and Coen, in my prayers. We will never forget 
the sacrifice made by the Caldwell family.
