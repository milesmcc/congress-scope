`Mr. BURRIS â€” 21 July 2009`

---


Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong 
opposition to Senator Thune's amendment regarding concealed carry 
reciprocity. This legislation ignores the explosion of gun crime 
plaguing America's cities and putting an unnecessary burden on local 
law enforcement.

In my home State of Illinois, an entire generation of young people, 
many of whom live in urban areas, is being decimated with gun violence. 
On May 10 of 2007, a 16-year-old honor student named Blair Holt was 
shot to death while riding a Chicago city bus. When the shooter opened 
fire, Blair was shot while protecting a young girl with whom he was 
riding. The shooter was also a 16-year-old boy and an admitted member 
of the Gangster Disciples national street gang. Just the other day, 
justice was presented to him when he was given 100 years in prison by 
the judge.

Similar tragic stories have only grown more frequent. In the first 6 
months of 2009, Chicago alone logged 202 homicides, 84 percent of whom 
were


shot to death. In comparison, in the same period of time, we lost 101 
troops in Iraq and 99 in Afghanistan.

The people of Chicago deserve better than life in a war zone. 
Hundreds of Chicago public school students have been shot so far this 
year. By the end of the school year in June, at least 36 had died.

Over the Fourth of July weekend, while most of us celebrated our 
Nation's independence, Chicago suffered through an almost unparalleled 
torrent of gun violence: 63 shootings were tallied, and 11 of them were 
fatal.

The carnage on Independence Day weekend led the Chicago Tribune to 
demand on July 10: ''Where is our courage? Where is the indignation 
over the slaughter of Chicago's children?''

This is far too high a price to pay for inaction. I will say it 
again: The people of Chicago deserve better than life in a war zone. 
Students deserve better than being gunned down in the streets after 
school and parents deserve better than having to raise families in the 
midst of a bloodbath. We must work vigorously to combat the rampant gun 
violence in our cities and urban areas.

As a registered gun owner myself, I respect the second amendment and 
responsible gun ownership. However, I am deeply concerned about the 
devastating consequences of guns falling into the wrong hands. To this 
end, I strongly believe we should keep firearms out of the hands of 
children, terrorists, and criminals, and in solving this problem we 
need to provide local law enforcement officials with the support they 
so desperately need.

Concealed carry regulation is an issue best left to cities and States 
and not the Federal Government. It is our job as Federal legislators to 
enact measures that strengthen States' law enforcement efforts instead 
of arbitrarily increasing their burden. A national standard of 
reciprocity would ignore the challenges local law enforcement struggles 
with on a daily basis when combating gangs and drug dealers in big 
cities.

I am not alone in my opposition to the Thune amendment. I join the 
International Association of Chiefs of Police and State lawmakers 
around the country in recognizing that this legislation would severely 
hamper efforts to combat gun crime in our Nation's urban areas.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 letters from the the 
mayor of the city of Chicago, Mayor Daley, and the Major Cities Chiefs 
Association be printed in the Record.
