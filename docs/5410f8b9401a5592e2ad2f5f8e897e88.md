Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, what I find most intriguing about this 
discussion is that those who are unemployed, to get this benefit, paid 
for this insurance policy. This is their money. When times were good, 
they put money away to unemployment insurance. And when times are bad, 
they get their insurance premiums back, known as unemployment benefits. 
It is as simple as that. This is their money, those who are unemployed.

Second, as my colleagues on the other side have forced through and 
agreed to spend $48 billion of U.S. taxpayer money to rebuild Iraq--
their roads, their bridges, their schools, their hospitals--but when it 
comes to Americans, to give them their unemployment insurance, there 
isn't any money in the system; you're breaking the bank; you can't 
afford it.



To those who want to advocate spending 13 years, 10 years, a decade, 
as long as it takes in Iraq, I find it ironic they find 13 weeks of 
additional unemployment insurance to help a family get through a bump 
economically as too much and too long.

Mr. Speaker, 8 years is too long for George Bush's economic policies. 
It's right to give these people the economic security they've earned 
and put away.
