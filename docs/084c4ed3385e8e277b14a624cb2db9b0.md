`Mr. PASCRELL â€” 1 May 2007`

---


Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, 1,460 days ago, we had lost 139 troops, 
brave men and women, in Iraq. 1,460 days later, Sergeant Michael 
Hullender from my district, from Little Falls, New Jersey, died on 
Saturday when an IED detonated near his patrol. He is one of 3,214 more 
troops that have died since supposedly major operations would cease.

The President made the Iraqi people believe that a new day of 
democracy was dawning and that brighter times lay ahead. Even the 
reconstruction of Iraq has gone awry. Even the reconstruction has been 
bought by the filthy hands of contractors who are concerned only for 
profit.

The President made the American people believe that the war was over, 
that the thousands of sailors who stood on the deck of that aircraft 
carrier that day were coming home soon. They did not.

The President has an opportunity to mend his ways this afternoon. 
Let's see what he does.
