## `6c617e03f4f1c80443440395eaf083e2`
`Mr. BERMAN â€” 18 December 2010`

---


Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, from December 3 to 5, a delegation of 
Members of the House met with a delegation of Members of the European 
Parliament for the 69th session of the Transatlantic Legislators' 
Dialogue. The TLD is the principal inter-parliamentary organization to 
foster discussion between U.S. and European Union legislators. 
Following my remarks is the Joint Statement issued by the TLD chairs 
and vice-chairs summarizing the results of this meeting.

A highlight of this meeting was the participation by the Foreign 
Minister of Pakistan, His Excellency Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who gave an 
enlightening presentation on current issues in Pakistan and the South 
Asia region. His remarks stimulated a lively discussion.

For the past four years, the TLD Congressional delegation has been 
ably chaired by our colleague, the gentlelady from Nevada, Ms. Shelley 
Berkley. Indeed, she has been the driving force in making the TLD an 
effective mechanism to strengthen the working relationship between the 
Congress and the European Parliament. In recognition of her energetic 
commitment to trans-Atlantic diplomacy, the participants honored her at 
this meeting. As Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I join 
them in commending Ms. Berkley for her outstanding leadership of the 
Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue.

 We, the Members of the European Parliament and the United 


 States House of Representatives, held our 69th 


 Interparliamentary meeting (Transatlantic Legislators' 


 Dialogue) in San Francisco, California, from 3-5 December 


 2010.



 Building on the joint statement issued following our last 


 meeting in Madrid on 3-6 June 2010 we reasserted the 


 importance of regular dialogue on political, social, 


 security, economic and environmental challenges that affect 


 all of our citizens. We agreed to report back to our parent 


 bodies on the content and outcome of our discussions in San 


 Francisco, in particular in the areas where joint efforts are 


 likely to produce positive outcomes.



 We discussed issues ranging from the global financial 


 situation and trade, to Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan 


 and climate change. We were briefed on data sharing and 


 privacy issues by Mary Ellen Callahan from the Department of 


 Homeland Security and met with the Foreign Minister of 


 Pakistan, His Excellency Shah Mehmood Qureshi.



 Our delegations noted that the U.S. and EU must be aware of 


 long-term trends and challenges including the economical and 


 political rise of Asia, cooperation with Latin America, and 


 seek answers to issues like climate change and cybersecurity. 


 In this context, we discussed inviting a NATO representative 


 to the next TLD meeting.



 The European Parliament Delegation expressed its gratitude 


 to the U.S. for its vote in support of a strengthened EU 


 presence in the United Nations General Assembly.



 We noted the statement by the leaders of the U.S. and the 


 EU giving a central role to




 the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), and outlining ''the 


 potential of transatlantic commerce to boost our growth and 


 generate jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.'' We support the 


 joint efforts to ''promote innovation, streamline regulation, 


 and eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade and investment, 


 bringing benefits to business, workers, and consumers in both 


 markets.'' The reducing of non tariff barriers and the 


 streamlining of regulations were agreed as priorities when 


 the TEC was established. We call on the TEC leaders once 


 again to reach out directly to Congress and the European 


 Parliament.



 The October 14 2010 European Parliament Delegation 'Brief 


 on EU-US trade and economic cooperation' was well received 


 and we look forward to further proposals to improve the 


 Transatlantic market. In this respect we also discussed the 


 need for us as legislators to take a more active role to 


 reduce non-tariff barriers to trans-Atlantic trade, including 


 working with executive agencies on a few specific projects, 


 for instance as regards product testing procedures of 


 automobiles and emerging products through advances in 


 nanotechnology.



 We discussed ways to further enhance our dialogue and 


 deepen transatlantic ties, even in times of economic 


 constraints and respecting the need for cost effectiveness, 


 including:



 --expanding contacts among staff of our institutions,



 --inviting EU and U.S. officials to provide perspectives on 


 strategic issues related to financial recovery and economic 


 growth,



 --expanding interaction between the U.S. Congress and the 


 European Parliament, including through video-conferencing,



 --promoting closer contacts between the Members responsible 


 for specific legislative issues, in particular on a committee 


 to committee basis,



 --the possibility of joint hearings and the issuance of 


 joint statements.



 In conclusion, we reaffirmed our commitment to 


 strengthening the transatlantic relationship and working in 


 partnership to solve common challenges. We pledged to 


 continue improving the effectiveness of our dialogue in order 


 to realise the full potential of our interparliamentary 


 relationship, as well as to ensure the relevance of the TLD's 


 work to the European Parliament and the United States 


 Congress.
