Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in the last few years, 30 foreign journalists 
have been murdered in a country torn by war. Violence against reporters 
is so severe that one American journalist has recently fled back to the 
United States. The would-be assassins have reportedly even be hired to 
come to America to track these reporters down.

Madam Speaker, I'm not talking about violent Iraq. I am talking about 
the murder of reporters in Mexico, second highest murder rate in the 
world for reporters, next to Iraq.

One of the vicious violent drug cartels, the Zetas, made up of former 
Mexican military officers, are targeting journalists who report on 
their drug activities. Now these dope dealing thugs claim they will 
just come to the United States, because of our porous borders, and kill 
these journalists.



The United States should heed the warnings reported by these 
courageous journalists, that these drug cartels are easily criss-
crossing the Texas-Mexico border and bringing more drug violence to 
America and Mexico.

Homeland Security should seize control of our border before the 
cartels seize the lives of any more journalists.

And that's just the way it is.
