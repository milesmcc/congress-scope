# RESOLUTIONS PROCEDURE
## `869602af2a9f162bf26f478d367c5e4c`
`Mr. REID â€” 7 February 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the advice and counsel of my 
friend from Mississippi. He certainly has the experience to offer 
suggestions, having served in various capacities in leadership. I have 
been with him. He is a pleasant man to work with, and I like him very 
much. But I would suggest, this morning, that we not use Super Bowl 
terminology and Manning and Grossman because I think, if we do that, we 
would find we would have a lot of objection if suddenly we looked 
around and Grossman was using a baseball or basketball rather than a 
football. I think what they have tried to do is change the rules in the 
middle of the game, and they are playing around with this procedural 
argument.

I have to acknowledge to my friend from Mississippi that the people 
over there who are trying to make the President not look bad had a 
little victory because they have been able to stall and stall. As a 
result of that, soldiers are being shipped, as we speak, without the 
Senate having to take a vote on whether that surge should take place. 
So in that respect, their stalling has probably benefited the 
President.

As far as process, we have worked through the ethics bill, the 
minimum wage bill, and even though there were cloture motions filed and 
cloture not invoked, finally, we were able to get those things passed. 
But I think debate on the surge would have been very important. We have 
been denied that. I understand the rules of the Senate.

My friend from Mississippi also says we should be doing something 
that is real. I tried to talk about something real this morning. More 
American troops were killed in combat in Iraq over the past 4 months 
than in any comparable stretch since the war began--334 dead American 
soldiers,


men and women, with mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and 
husbands and wives.


I think over the last few days, though, there has been a deafening 
silence, and people standing here and saying what the President is 
doing is the right thing to do, because it hasn't been the right thing 
to do, what the President has been doing, and he wants to continue more 
of the same.

I understand we are now at a point where we are going to talk about a 
couple of important nominations. We are going to try to get our fiscal 
house in order, which is not in order, because unless we do something 
by February 15, basically the Government closes. This is very unusual. 
I have spoken with the distinguished Republican leader, and one thing 
we are going to work on together this year, once we get out of this 
situation with the continuing resolution, is to work together to try to 
pass appropriations bills. That is good for the institution and good 
for the country. We are going to try to do that. It may require some 
late nights and long weeks, but we are going to do that. We have 13 
appropriations bills, and we are going to work very hard to get them 
passed.

So I am terribly disappointed we haven't had the opportunity to vote 
on Senator Warner's and Senator Levin's resolution, and on the McCain 
resolution, but we have heard enough about that. We are not going to be 
able to do that, and we will move on to other things.
