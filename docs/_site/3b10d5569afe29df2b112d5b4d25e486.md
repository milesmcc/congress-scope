`Mr. KINGSTON â€” 22 March 2007`

---


Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and 
rise in opposition to the bill.



I want to say this: We have had a lot of good, sincere debates in the 
Defense Subcommittee of Appropriations, but one of the things that, in 
our honest disagreement about, that we have not talked about as much is 
the effects that the surge has already had. I wanted to bring up some 
statistics.

The 4 weeks prior to the surge which began on February 15, we had 
1,440 civilian deaths; since that time, 265. That is a reduction of 
about 500 percent.

In terms of bombings, prior to the surge, we had 163. Then from 
February to March, it is down to 102.

Similar with car bombings, down 35 percent from 56 to 36.

The surge is already showing a significant impact. Two-thirds of the 
Iraqis polled by a British polling firm, 5,000 people which were 
sampled, the largest poll in the history of Iraq, two-thirds of the 
people say they are better off now than they were under Saddam Hussein. 
Seventy-three percent say they are not in a civil war. Al-Maliki, the 
Prime Minister's approval rating has gone from 29 percent in September 
to 49 percent now.

We are making progress. We are not defending the status quo. We are 
changing the course, and the Petraeus plan needs to be given time to 
work, and that is very, very important.

The second point that I want to make is there are so many 
extracurricular things in the $23 billion in spending that have nothing 
to do with the war in Iraq. Now, I serve on the Ag Committee, and I 
want to mention some of those.

There is a $100 million increase in the PL-480 program, but there is 
not a single word of it in the report as to why this is justified, why 
this is considered an emergency, $100 million.

Secondly, we have $25 million in there for spinach recall. The USDA 
did what they were supposed to do, but I want you to know you are 
setting a precedent for recall. We are not in the product compensation 
business on recalls.

Finally, we have $5 million in the bill because of a Canadian fish 
import issue.

All of these things are good, debatable topics, but they do not 
belong in an emergency appropriation bill. I think they should come 
back through the committee process on regular order where we can have a 
good debate and look at them on a separate piece of legislation.

While some of the provisions I support, such as the peanut storage 
and handling provision and some type of agriculture disaster 
assistance, this bill is not the appropriate place for them to be 
considered.

Title II-P.L. 480 Grants--The bill contains $100,000,000 above the 
President's request for Title II-P.L. 480 Grants.

There is not a single word of explanation in the report as to what or 
where the additional funds are to be used for.

The President's request included $350,000,000 of which approximately 
$150,000,000 would go to Sudan and for populations in Chad affected by 
the violence in Darfur; $30,000,000 for Afghanistan; $95,000,000 for 
Southern Africa; and $75,000,000 for the Horn of Africa.

Just last month the Congress included $1,215 billion for this program 
in the Joint Resolution to fund this program for the remainder of 
fiscal year 2007.

The bill provides $140,000,000 in additional relief for loses related 
to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of which $25,000,000 would go to provide 
additional compensation to livestock producers and $100,000,000 would 
go to provide additional compensation for citrus producers--it appears 
that these additional funds are included in the bill only for the 
reason of doubling the $80,000 payment that livestock and citrus 
producers have already received, taking their payments up to $160,000.

The need for agriculture disaster assistance has been debated for the 
last several months.

While disaster assistance is clearly needed in some areas of the 
country, this bill provides $25 million for spinach producers who had 
losses due to a nationwide spinach recall last fall.

The FDA did what is was supposed to do, and initiated the recall to 
protect consumers.

This assistance is unprecedented, and there will be pressure put on 
this Committee to compensate producers whenever other food products are 
recalled.

Can you imagine the cost if we get in the business of compensating 
producers for losses that they incur because of food recalls? The 
latest list of some of the food recalls from FDA and USDA include: 
bread; peanut butter; corn chips; olives; oysters; milk; fresh cut 
fruit; summer sausage; ground beef; and the list goes on.

The reason foods were recalled is because they presented a health 
risk to the public, and the FDA or the USDA did what they were supposed 
to do.

The bill includes $5,000,000 for compensation to aquaculture 
operations who may have incurred a loss due to a restriction on imports 
from certain fish from Canada.

The emergency order, put on by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, on these fish from Canada was due to outbreaks or potential 
outbreaks of a destructive pathogen responsible for several large-scale 
fish deaths in the Great Lakes region--the reason APHIS put the order 
in place was to protect aquaculture in the Great Lakes states, and 
somehow $5,000,000 makes it into this bill to compensate for possible 
losses without any justification. Where did this number come from?

Finally, there are no funds for USDA to administer any of the 
disaster assistance provisions in the bill that total nearly 
$4,500,000,000. Members are already reacting to proposed FSA office 
closures that are occurring all over the country. This will only 
exacerbate the problem.













 iraqi government progress




 According to the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, over the last 30 


 days they have seen important developments in the history of 


 Iraq. The Iraqi government has taken steps to improve 


 security, governance, economic development and economic 


 opportunities.



 Iraq's Prime Minister is actively leading the latest plan 


 in Baghdad.



 Prime Minister Maliki created six committees to oversee the 


 non-security pieces of the Baghdad plan, with oversight of 


 economic development, essential services, communications, 


 community outreach and related functions.



 Prime Minister Maliki's first trip to Anbar Province was a 


 clear gesture and attempt to involve Sunni tribal sheiks into 


 the government.



 Anbar's tribal sheiks are switching allegiances away from 


 the insurgents and towards the government of Iraq.



 The tribal sheikhs have started providing police and army 


 recruits to support stability in the region.



 At the end of February, the Iraqi parliament's Council of 


 Ministers passed a hydrocarbon law that outlines the 


 equitable sharing of Iraq's oil wealth.



 The Iraqi government hosted the Neighbors' Conference, the 


 first international conference in Baghdad since 1990. The 


 conference ended with regional and international partners 


 pledging to fight terrorism and to enhance security in 


 support of the goal of peace and security for the people of 


 Iraq.



 Iran and Syria along with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, 


 Turkey and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security 


 Council attended the conference.















 military progress




 SecDef stated (Mar 21) the deployment of Iraqi troops into 


 Baghdad is right on schedule--10 brigades total.



 Operational strength of the Iraqi Brigades in Baghdad has 


 vastly improved.



 First Brigade reported at 61 percent; Second came in at 65 


 percent; and the third came in at 85 percent. Other brigades 


 on their way are reporting in the high 90s to more than 100 


 percent strength.



 The problem was not related to fighting, but rather an 


 issue with getting pay to families. Iraq does not have a 


 financial system that provides for electronic transfer of 


 monies--it is a cash transaction society. The Iraqi 


 Government found that troops were trying to take money to 


 their families and that is the reason they were absent.



 They fixed the problem by paying deploying forces a bonus 


 upfront so they could leave money with their families and not 


 have to worry about them.



 Overall, violence directed against Iraqi Civilians is down 


 about one-third and murders/assassinations are down 50 


 percent.



 Civilian deaths down more than 500 percent: mid-Feb to mid-


 March, 265; previous four weeks, 1,440.



 Bombings down nearly 40 percent: mid-Feb to mid-March, 102; 


 previous 4 weeks, 163.



 Car bombs down nearly 35 percent: mid-Feb to mid-March, 36; 


 previous 4 weeks, 56.








notes from secdef's talk at army caucus--mar 22




 Active Army has met every retention and recruiting goal 


 since 9/11



 Need to grow Army and we're doing so by 7,000 a year



 Vital to meet Active Army's goal of 1 year deployed and 2 


 years home; Guard/Reserve goal is 1 year deployed and 5 years 


 home



 Need to include Guard and Reserve in all of our plans



 Modernization and putting them in Joint billets



 We have programmed $46.4B for reset in FY 07/08



 Modernization is also required--started $56B short



 Need the FY07 Sup by April or we will have to take 


 Draconian measures and begin to reprogram money, impacting 


 all facets of the Army



 Need $2B for BRAC this year and stated that we need to 


 expedite the construction of the medical facility on Ft 


 Belvoir and make Bethesda the premier medical facility













commonly asked question iraq




 Q: What is your view of the timetables and provisions that 


 have been attached to the FY07 Supplemental?



 A: It's important to elevate the level of debate. . . . 


 question is how we incentiveize the Iraqi government. But, 


 specific dates and strict conditionally would make it 


 impossible for commanders to complete the mission.



 Q: Do you think the operations in Iraq will be over on 


 October 1?



 A: Decisions need to be based by conditions on the ground. 


 Setting a date tells your adversary all he has to do is wait. 


 I think debate on the hill has been helpful; there is no 


 military solution, it has to be a political solution and we 


 are providing them the time they need.



 Q: How is the deployment of Iraqi troops going? We have 


 heard they are reporting at low strength rates?



 A: In Afghanistan, there are about 12 financial centers 


 that enable movement of money. Iraq has no such system yet, 


 so troops have to take cash home to their families. First 


 Brigades came in around 60 percent but other brigades are 


 reporting in the high 90s to more than 100 percent strength. 


 The problem was not related to fighting, but rather an issue 


 with getting pay to families--troops were trying to take 


 money to their families and that is the reason they were 


 absent. They fixed the problem by paying deploying forces a 


 bonus upfront so they could leave money with their families 


 and not have to worry about them.



 Q: Are we neglecting Afghanistan?



 A: After I visited Afghanistan, I made the decision to 


 extend the deployment of one Brigade and move the other 


 Brigade in. We will be adding 3,400 trainers and overall 


 about 6-7,000 soldiers. Britain and Australia are also 


 providing more troops as we prepare for a Taliban offensive 


 this spring. We think they may make a run at Khandahar and we 


 want to hit them hard.
