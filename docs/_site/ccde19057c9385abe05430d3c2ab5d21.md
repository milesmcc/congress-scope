Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the last word.

Mr. Chairman, with great respect, again, for our ranking member and 
for my friend Mr. Shays, who I know has been to Iraq many times, I do 
hope that in light of the supplemental, which has been funded at $2.8 
billion, and an additional supplemental which will be presented to the 
Congress in September for another $2.8 billion, we won't cut the rug 
from under our good friend, the competent Ambassador Ryan Crocker, and 
take this $158 million from the State Department for several lines that 
have been funded already in the supplemental. I won't go through that 
again.

Mr. Ryan Crocker represents us, and I am so proud of his good work. I 
would like to support him and the other good men and women in the State 
Department around the world.

So let's defeat this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this amendment.
