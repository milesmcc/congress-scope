`Mr. GINGREY of Georgia â€” 9 July 2009`

Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today, the residents of 
Adairsville, Georgia, in my district, the 11th, are saying good-bye to 
a local hero who died while bravely serving his Nation in Afghanistan. 
Lance Corporal Seth Sharp was killed in action on July 2, 2009, from a 
gunshot wound to his neck during one of the biggest United States 
military operations in Afghanistan since the global war on terror began 
back in 2001.

Later this week, I will join Seth's family, his friends and 
supporters at his funeral in honor of the life of this brave soldier, a 
life given as the ultimate sacrifice, a sacrifice of duty and love. 
For, as it is written in John, ''Greater love hath no man than this, 
that a man lay down his life for his friends.''



This was not Seth's first deployment in the global war on terror. He 
enlisted with the Marines at age 17 and was serving his Nation in Iraq 
at age 18. Even at such a young age, Seth embraced the challenge of the 
Marine Corps and took pride in serving his country. His service and his 
sacrifice will never be forgotten.

Lance Corporal Sharp leaves behind his fiancee and lifelong 
sweetheart, Katie McMahon; his father and his stepmother, Rick and 
Tiffany Sharp of Adairsville, Georgia; his mother, Angela Preston of 
Alligator Point, Florida; as well as many other close relatives and 
friends spread out all across the country.

Mr. Speaker, my prayers go out to his family, and my most heartfelt 
gratitude goes out to Lance Corporal Seth Sharp for his selfless 
sacrifice for this Nation. I ask all Members to please join me in 
honoring the distinguished memory of Lance Corporal Seth Sharp.
