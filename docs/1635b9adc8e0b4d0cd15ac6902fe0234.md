Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. It is. And it's hard to imagine what's more 
important. Should we continue to spend $14 million an hour in Iraq? 
Fourteen million dollars an hour is what we are spending in Iraq. Yet 
we can't come up with the funding that we need to make sure that all 
the kids in this country that are eligible for Head Start and for 
subsidized child care can actually go.
