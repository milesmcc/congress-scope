Mr. HINCHEY. Thank you very much. I very much appreciate the 
statement that was just made by our colleague from Ohio, Marcy Kaptur, 
the respect that she has given to our military, appropriately so, and 
her examination of the consequences that we


are confronting now in Iraq as a result of the incompetent way in which 
this administration has dealt with the political and economic 
circumstances there in that country.

I would like now to yield time to my friend and colleague from New 
York, John Hall.
