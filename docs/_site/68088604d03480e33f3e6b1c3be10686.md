`Mr. ETHERIDGE â€” 10 July 2008`

---


Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Reverend 
Bill Goodnight of First Presbyterian church of Lillington, NC. On the 
230th birthday of this great Nation, Reverend Goodnight expressed his 
patriotism with a most fitting prayer. His prayer embodies the values 
on which the United States of America was founded. These are the same 
values that we as Americans still hold near and dear to our hearts 
today, I would like to share this prayer with my colleagues and my 
fellow Americans.




 ''Eternal God we come before you on this birthday of our 


 nation 230th birthday of our Nation. We come with praises 


 upon our lips for your love and mercy, which makes itself 


 know throughout the earth. We come with praises for your 


 mighty creative energy that hung the stars and spun the 


 planets and for your still small voice that speaks in the 


 silence of the canyons and booms out across the oceans waves. 


 For those with eyes to see and wars to hear your spirit is 


 seen dancing upon our golden meadows, your song is heard in 


 the cry of the bald eagle, your presence is felt in the 


 deepest canyon and the highest mountain . . .



 Yet we confess eternal creator that we have too often 


 sought your blessing without begging for your transforming 


 power that calls us into a nation of servanthood in this and 


 every hour. We confess that we are quick to proclaim that you 


 are on our side without checking to make sure that we are on 


 your side.



 Therefore, we celebrate with thanksgiving this Fourth of 


 July, not only the great provisions of this land but your 


 patience toward us when we forget that to whom much is given 


 much is expected. We thank you for your protection from 


 pestilence and the horrors of famine known to much of this 


 world. We thank you for a stable government which works to 


 guarantee our freedoms and provides us with protection 


 against those who would do us harm. We are particularly 


 grateful this night for our leaders that are here with us as 


 a reminder that by your will we truly are a government of the 


 people and by the people.



 Our strongest petitions this night we reserve those brave 


 men and women who have obeyed the orders of their commander 


 in chief and have stepped into harms way in distant land, 


 particularly Afghanistan and Iraq. We cry for the widows, 


 widowers, and orphans left in the wake of the current 


 conflict on both sides of this war. Let not our tears be 


 empty but grant to us the fortitude and resolve as a 


 community that we might nurture those who have sacrificed so 


 much on our account. May those who have risked so much in 


 fulfilling their military obligations find us a united 


 community in support of them and their dependents. May we 


 walk with them and their loves ones on the road of life 


 offering the well-deserved hand of friendship and fellowship. 


 We know that nothing can make up for what we have sent them 


 to endure, but may our overwhelming gratitude and respect 


 offer them comfort.



 Help us to live our lives with grateful hearts, teach us 


 how to be there for each other when tragedy strikes, and give 


 us plenty of opportunities to rejoice with one another when 


 good comes our neighbor's way.



 In closing, we ask not only your blessing upon us but for 


 your guidance and inspiration that we might reflect and be a 


 source for the world of the blessings we seek for ourselves. 


 Alleluia Amen.''


Madam Speaker, Reverend Goodnight is an exemplary figure of 
patriotism, leadership, dedication, and commitment to this great 
Nation.
