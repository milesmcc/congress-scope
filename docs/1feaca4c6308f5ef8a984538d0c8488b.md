Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I was honored to open the House this 
morning during this most important Women's History Month.

Our Nation's foremothers stood up to injustice and, by changing the 
course of history, opened the doors of opportunity to all of America's 
daughters. It is our duty to recognize and honor their tireless 
efforts.

This past summer, our great Nation celebrated the 160th anniversary 
of the 1848 Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. This 
groundbreaking convention was dedicated to the key principle in the 
Declaration of Independence that we are all created equal.

From securing a woman's right to vote in 1920 to serving our country 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have come a long way.

In this Congress alone, we have much to celebrate: Speaker Pelosi is 
the first woman to lead this esteemed body, and Senator Clinton made 
''18 million cracks'' in the Nation's highest glass ceiling as the 
first woman to run a formidable Presidential campaign.

Yet as we celebrate these important milestones and look back at all 
we have achieved since 1948, we know our journey toward true gender 
equality is not complete. We must continue to fight for equality this 
month. We honor the women who blazed the trail for all women.
