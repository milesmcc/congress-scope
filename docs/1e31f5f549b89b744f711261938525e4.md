Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, at this time I am very happy to yield 5 
minutes to my good friend from Bridgeport, Connecticut (Mr. Shays), who 
next weekend will be making his 18th trip to Iraq. I know he shares my 
concern over the fact that, unfortunately, this rule fails to allow 
this House to consider the work of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group.
