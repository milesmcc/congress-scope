Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the Lonestar Voice this week comes from 
Geoffrey Brown of Baytown, Texas. Here is what he has to say:

''We need to show more sympathy for these people. They travel miles 
in the heat, they risk their lives crossing a border. They don't get 
paid enough wages. They do jobs that others won't do or are afraid to 
do. They live in crowded conditions among a people who speak a 
different language. They rarely see their families, and they face 
adversity all day every day. No, I'm not talking about illegals; I'm 
talking about our troops. Doesn't it seem strange that the 
(politicians) are willing to lavish all kinds of social benefits on 
illegals, but don't support our troops and have threatened to defund 
them?''

Geoffrey Brown echoes the sentiments of many other Americans who 
wonder why so many people in Washington show more concern for illegals


who pledge allegiance to other countries than they do our U.S. troops 
fighting in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan.

Supporting the American military and our veterans is more important 
than expensive giveaway programs to illegals.

And that's just the way it is.
