Mr. KUCINICH. I appreciate that.

So we have special forces now at least 20 miles inside the border of 
Pakistan by news accounts, and they want us to help them there, while 
Pakistan at the same time is helping those who are shooting at our 
troops in Afghanistan.

Now, who are our allies? Who are our enemies here? That's the danger 
of getting increasingly involved on the ground in Pakistan. That is why 
I brought this resolution forward with the help of Mr. Paul. We have to 
have this debate.
