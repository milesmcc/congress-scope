`Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida â€” 10 March 2010`

---


Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I think this has 
been a good discussion today. And I think it is appropriate to have it. 
I certainly hope that the result is clear, and that this Congress today 
strongly and in a bipartisan way rejects the resolution that is being 
brought forth. It would be a grave mistake for us to allow the Taliban 
to regain power in Afghanistan.

Sometimes the lessons of history may be a little bit more difficult 
to explain. In this case, when the Taliban was in power they opened the 
country up to training camps for terrorists to attack the United 
States. That was in 2001. It is not ancient history. So I hope we don't 
forget the lessons of history.

In addition, as I said before, Mr. Speaker, our Armed Forces with our 
coalition allies and the Afghan armed forces are in the midst of the 
first major offensive in President Obama's new strategy. So I think it 
would be a grave mistake if this Congress does not clearly and 
emphatically reject the resolution today.

Having said that, I yield back the balance of my time.
