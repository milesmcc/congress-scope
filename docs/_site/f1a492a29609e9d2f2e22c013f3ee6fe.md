`Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the resolution but in support of our troops.

According to former Congressman, Senator, and Secretary of State 
Daniel Webster, ''God grants liberty only to those who love it and are 
always ready to guard and defend it.'' That was true in the mid 1800s 
and it is still true today.

I represent the First District of Tennessee. Tennessee is known as 
the Volunteer State because of our heavy involvement in the Mexican War 
and the willingness of our men and women down through history to 
volunteer for service to our country.

Right now, there are brave men and women in our armed services who 
are sacrificing for our freedom. The people of the First District of 
Tennessee and I are indeed indebted for their service and we thank 
these brave soldiers and we pray for them and their families.

There are some who would want to limit their discussion to Iraq, 
while in fact we are involved in a global war on terror. We must be 
committed to win this war on terror that was started by radical Islamic 
extremists. This war did not start on September 11. We have been in a 
war for many years.

Many of you will recall the Iranian hostage crisis, 1979, 52 
Americans held hostage, 444 days.

As we move forward in history, the Beirut bombings, 1983. Two hundred 
forty-one of our brave marine soldiers were killed.

Then we had the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.

Then we had the USS Cole in 2000. Seventeen Americans killed.

Then finally, September 11, 2001, 3,000 Americans killed.

This war didn't start on September 11 and this war is not with Iraq. 
This is a war with radical Islam. We are involved to win a battle with 
terrorists who hate us, who hate our freedoms and who quite frankly 
hate our religion. The extremists have engaged us in battle. We owe it 
to our fellow citizens to see that we have nothing less than total 
victory.

Congress should not micromanage this war. We have one Commander in 
Chief. It is fine to disagree and to point out mistakes, but this 
resolution is a step to weaken the morale of our troops and it will 
embolden our enemies. We cannot allow this to become another Vietnam 
situation, a situation where politicians tried to manage the war.

My emotions run high as I remember that era. My first cousin, Fred 
Gouge, was laid to rest just 1 week ago. Fred was wounded in that war 
in Vietnam, a war that was micromanaged by politicians. Because of that 
conflict, he spent the better part of the last 40 years in a 
wheelchair. He received a Purple Heart for his service. He was a war 
hero, just like the men and women of our military are right now.

We cannot afford to ignore the advice of General Petraeus, who was 
recently unanimously approved by the Senate, and the advice of his 
commanders. I would ask, Madam Speaker, what message does a nonbinding 
resolution really send? This resolution says that this Congress will 
support our troops who have defended our freedoms, or who are currently 
serving in harm's way, but that is little comfort for those brave men 
and women who would be called upon to protect us and our families in 
the future. This nonbinding resolution is only playing politics with 
our brave soldiers, their lives and our future as a nation. To suggest 
that we can support the troops but not be in the battle to win is 
ridiculous and shortsighted.

I can remember as a child watching many different western television 
shows. Growing up, I don't know of many my age that didn't want to be 
the cowboy in the Wild West. After seeing many of these stories, you 
realize that when the hero is in trouble, they sound the alarm, or blow 
the trumpet, and in races the cavalry to join their brothers in arms to 
win the fight.

Madam Speaker, the trumpet has been sounded. It is time for the 
cavalry to join our brothers and sisters in arms to gain victory in 
this global war on terror. As the trumpet has been sounded, we have 
politicians in Washington who want to sit on their hands and not send 
in the troops.

Looking at the latest news, as additional forces are moving in, 
radical Islamic leaders like al-Sadr are fleeing for their strongholds. 
It has been reported that he has left Iraq for his own protection. The 
additional troops are already having a positive impact on the region. 
We have the ability to win this war on terrorism, and we must win this 
war to protect America today and for our future generations.

Madam Speaker, that is why I will join many of my colleagues in 
voting ''no'' on this resolution.
