Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding and salute his 
leadership on this committee and our long, long, long friendship as 
southern California Representatives.

I rise in support of this legislation and again thank the committee 
leadership and committee members for including language in the original 
House bill and the original committee's report reflecting many of the 
concerns I have about nuclear proliferation in Pakistan. Regrettably, 
some of that language is not in this compromise, though I applaud 
section 203's limitations.

Mr. Speaker, Pakistan poses one of the most complex foreign policy 
challenges facing the United States today.


It sits at the intersection of vital security interests, from terrorism 
to nuclear proliferation to the war in Afghanistan.

A secure and stable Pakistan is of critical importance to the United 
States, and yet, with a large al Qaeda presence, a vibrant Taliban 
insurgency, and widespread political unrest, that stability is anything 
but guaranteed.

Recent news reports suggest that the city of Quetta is becoming the 
new stronghold for the Taliban. Our extremely capable Ambassador to 
Pakistan, Anne Patterson, says that ''our intelligence on Quetta is 
vastly less, we have no people there, no cross-border operations, no 
predators.''

The stakes are truly high. Pakistan's nuclear stockpile cannot be 
allowed to fall into the wrong hands.

In March, I worked with Chairman Berman to incorporate language that 
would guarantee U.S. investigators access to individuals suspected of 
proliferation activities. While that language is not in this bill, this 
bill does limit security-related assistance contingent upon Pakistan's 
help dismantling proliferation networks and combating terrorist groups.

A few weeks ago, a Pakistani court lifted the requirement that A.Q. 
Khan, the mastermind of the most notorious nuclear smuggling ring ever, 
remain under police escort when traveling around the country. Just 
recently, Khan boasted to the press that the Government of Pakistan was 
complicit in his past activity.
