Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. If the gentleman would yield, there are 
some fallacies about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that I 
think we need to put to rest.

One is there is an emergency provision, you can just listen to this 
stuff and go to the court 72 hours from now. You have an emergency 
provision. It is true there is an emergency provision, but you have to 
develop the whole case for probable cause and present it to the 
Attorney General who has to stand in the shoes of the judge. So you 
have to get all of the work done; you just don't have the final signoff 
for a judge. And the time problem occurs before you get to that point. 
It is to develop the whole case for probable cause.

I have seen one of these packets. It is sometimes close to 2 inches 
thick of paper that explains how you meet all of the requirements of 
the act. When it really matters, when we had three soldiers who were 
kidnapped in Iraq, it took over 24 hours to get an emergency warrant.

I don't know whether that would have saved our soldiers or not. We 
thought we had a tip on who it was that had kidnapped them. I don't 
know if it would have been fast enough even if we would have been able 
to turn it on immediately. But I know if they were my kids, a 24-hour 
delay is not good enough, and we should expect more from our 
Government.
