Mr. PETERS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Chair, in the interests of common sense, I rise today to offer 
an amendment that will save taxpayer dollars by reducing waste in 
prescription medications at the VA. Currently, whenever patients leave 
a VA hospital, leftover medications like eye drops and inhalers are 
just thrown away. Often, veterans would have to go right to the 
pharmacy to refill what was discarded.

My amendment simply directs the VA to implement a program that would 
re-label prescription drugs used in VA hospitals to be sent home with 
discharged patients for outpatient use. My amendment offers a simple, 
commonsense change that will save taxpayers an estimated $14 million 
over 10 years, while saving patients both time and effort.

I am proud that this amendment has the support of the American Legion 
and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and urge its passage 
here today.

I yield to the gentleman from Texas.
