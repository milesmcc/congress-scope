Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time.

First off, I want to start off by congratulating the majority on the 
very commendable earmark reform legislation that is contained in this 
title. I just want to emphasize that. But this PAYGO package is 
woefully inadequate. It is a paper tiger.

Three quick points. Number one, this protects all current spending, 
even the programs that are scheduled to expire. However, it assumes 
that expiring tax relief will lapse; and, thus, require offsets to 
continue. This is a double standard that reflects their preference, 
protect higher spending but not lower taxes. It is a recipe for tax 
increases.

Number two, it contains a huge loophole. Spend now, save later. You 
can enact new spending now and come up with savings down the road, 
which we know never really happens. Big loophole.

Number three, this is a weaker version of PAYGO than what the 
majority was proposing just last year. They were not allowing points of 
order to be waived when you violated a PAYGO rule in their earlier 
version. But now when they are in the majority, you can simply waive it 
with a majority vote upstairs in the Rules Committee.

This is a much weaker version of PAYGO. But I want to address a few 
other things.

Number one, you are going to hear this all year: They gave us a 
surplus. We inherited a surplus; we squandered the surplus.

Madam Speaker, what was the surplus? The surplus was a projection. It 
was a projection by economists at OMB and CBO that said we are going to 
have all of this money coming in.

You know what they didn't project, they didn't project 9/11. They 
didn't project war. They didn't project the dot-com bubble bursting or 
the recession or the Enron scandals. What did that do? It was a fiscal 
train wreck for America, and our numbers went down and we had to spend 
more money when we went to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Where are we today? The budget deficit went down 40 percent. In 1 
year, the budget deficit went down 40 percent off projections. Why, 
Madam Speaker? It went down that much because revenues increased. Why 
did revenues increase, because we let the American people keep more of 
their own hard-earned dollars. They were able to keep more of their tax 
dollars.

There is a very deep difference between our two parties on principle 
and on philosophy. We believe that the money in America in the Federal 
Government is the people's money. That the money we spend is not our 
money, it is the money of our constituents. It is their money.

When you see rules like this, which I want to quote from the Wall 
Street Journal: PAYGO, by contrast, gives the appearance of spending 
discipline while making it all but impossible to let taxpayers keep 
more of their own money. It should really be called spend and tax as 
you go.

This bill does nothing to control current spending. It does nothing 
to reduce the current deficit, and it puts us on a path to raise taxes.

We believe the priorities ought to be different: That we ought to 
control spending and reduce spending to balance the budget, not raise 
taxes because after all, the money that comes to the Federal Government 
is not our money. It is the people's money. It comes from the paychecks 
of working Americans, men and women, small businesses, farmers and 
businesses. By letting people keep more of their own hard-earned 
dollar, our economy grows, revenues grow. We have to watch spending. 
That is where the priorities ought to be placed. This does not deliver 
that.

Hopefully we can work together in the future to have a real spending


mechanism that actually controls spending rather than puts us on a 
pathway to higher taxes.

Madam Speaker, I reluctantly oppose this legislation because of the 
honorable earmark reforms.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
