`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 17 October 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to address the 
House. My good friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey), we 
have traveled together and served together. I want that chart that he 
has. I keep asking him for it. About how when Democrats take control, 
pork barrel spending is cut in half. I appreciate it. I am glad for his 
accuracy.

It is so good to serve with my colleagues up here in Washington, D.C. 
I am here with my good friend, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. Our 
districts neighbor each other in south Florida. We have been good 
friends for a long time. We are here tonight part of the 30-Something 
Working Group.

Mr. Speaker, as you know, we come to the floor once, twice, and when 
we can three times a week to share with Members issues we are working 
on here.

We want to make sure that all of the Members are fully aware of what 
is happening in Iraq. As of today, October 17, 10 a.m. report, there 
have been 3,824 deaths in Iraq. The total number wounded in action and 
returned to duty is 15,604. The total number of wounded in action not 
returning to duty is 12,674.

We want to make sure that is not only a part of the Congressional 
Record, but that every Member of Congress understands the sacrifice 
those who are in harm's way are making. And those of us who are 
policymakers, that we make sure that we take the appropriate steps to 
do away with that number continually going up on a daily basis.

Mr. Speaker, I want to turn it over to my colleagues that are here, 
but tonight I just want to take a point because the President today had 
a press conference. We did some good things. We gave out a 
Congressional Gold Medal today, and the President decided to release a 
press release driving over to the Capitol here.

It was very interesting. In his statements he said that the 110th 
Congress, Democratic-controlled Congress, whether it be House or 
Senate, they need to go to work. That is interesting because I have 
record-breaking information here. We have taken more rollcall votes 
than any other Congress in the history of the United States of America. 
We are working 5 days a week in many cases. We have deaths or what have 
you. We have to pause for that. And national holidays and religious 
holidays that need to be recognized because there is sensitivity 
towards that.

But I can't understand, we start talking about going to work. Let me 
read down the list of things we have done. The 9/11 Commission 
recommendations, all of them, to protect America from terrorism, 
passed. And the President said he wasn't going to sign it, but the 
American people pushed him and said they wanted to be safe, and he 
finally signed it.

The largest college aid expansion since 1944, the GI bill, saving the 
average American $4,400. The President said he would never sign that 
bill. Because of the hard work of Members that voted for that bill, and 
these are bipartisan votes. I want to make sure that those who are 
paying attention to what we are saying here on the floor, those Members 
and Americans, that they understand this is not a Democratic message, 
this is a bipartisan message on behalf of the people of this country.

The minimum-wage increase which raised the minimum wage for some 13 
million Americans, passed and signed into law. The President said he 
wasn't going to sign that, but it was such a good piece of legislation. 
People wanted it to happen for many, many years. We said we will not 
allow the Members of Congress to receive a pay raise until we give the 
American people a pay raise.

Innovation agenda to promote 21st century jobs, passed and signed 
into law. All of this was signed into law at like 7:30 on a Friday 
evening as the President is leaving to go to Camp David.

Again, tough lobbying and ethics reforms that many of the independent 
reform groups are so happy that finally passed off this floor, through 
the Senate, and signed into law.

Reconstruction assistance for the gulf coast disaster hurricanes, 
never would have happened, Mr. Speaker, if it wasn't for the push of 
this Democratic Congress. Actually, I remember when they had two 
amendments that came to the floor, one to give assistance to the 
victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, and one to continue 
the funding for the war for 3 months, they came in two amendments, 
never would have happened if it wasn't for a Democratic-controlled 
Congress pushing it through.

Expansion of life-saving medical research stem cells, passed on a 
bipartisan vote, vetoed by the President. Okay.

Again, health care for 10 million children and working families, 
passed by a bipartisan vote. A bipartisan vote which tomorrow, and we 
are going to talk about that here tonight, the Senate has the votes to 
override the President and there are some Republicans that are saying 
that they are going to take that vote. We have a problem here in the 
House because we don't have some of our friends, and I do mean some of 
our friends because some of our friends on the Republican side of the 
aisle are going to be voting with Democrats. Not with Democrats, but 
just to


vote on behalf of children in the United States of America. We are 
falling eight or 10 short of those votes. I want the Members to be 
aware of that.

The largest veterans increase in the 77-year history of the VA passed 
this House and we are still waiting on it to make it through the 
process and hopefully the President won't veto that.

Landmark energy independence and global warming initiative, that is 
something that is very, very important. Also, we have other pieces of 
legislation that are out there.

Actually since the partisan politics started, not partisan, but some 
of the folks being partisan on this, 45 that we had last time of 
Republicans that joined Democrats on that bipartisan vote, so that's 
not 10, that's not 15, that's not 20, that is 45 of our Republican 
colleagues that, because of the Democratic leadership bringing it to 
the floor, knew it was a good idea and voted on behalf of their 
districts.

With that, I want to make sure, just in case someone gets confused 
about that issue, because we are going to talk about SCHIP. We are 
going to do a hard push on SCHIP because this is about children's 
health care, and it is very, very important.

I yield to Ms. Wasserman Schultz.
