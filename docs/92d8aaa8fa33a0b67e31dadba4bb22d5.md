# FISA MODIFICATIONS

`Mr. HATCH â€” 3 August 2007`

Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as Congress prepares to adjourn for the 
traditional August recess, I want to draw continued emphasis to a 
significant issue: FISA modernization.

I am greatly encouraged by the bipartisan negotiations concerning 
this topic. However, I remain troubled about the possibility of 
adjournment without resolution of this vital initiative. It is very--
simple passing a bill with limited FISA modernization will contribute 
to a safer America. If passing this bill means we must delay our 
recess, then we must do it. We should be able to get together today, 
though.

Do you think al-Qaida takes a recess? It is essential that we not 
adjourn until we send an appropriate bill to the President.

While some issues that we debate in Congress necessitate that we 
persuade Members of a pressing need, this is not one of them. Every 
Senator in the 110th Congress knows that the current FISA statute has 
loopholes which are putting our country at increased risk.

How should we tackle this issue? I suggest we take a logical and 
sound approach: Identify the problem, discuss and debate solutions, 
implement the solution. In this case, we have identified the problem.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has not been changed to 
reflect the vast technological changes that have occurred since this 
law was passed in 1978. Since the law has not been appropriately 
modified, our Nation is missing potentially valuable intelligence that 
is essential to protect our country. Getting this intelligence is 
essential for our safety. It is about getting the enemy's secrets--
their plans and intentions--without them knowing we've got them.

The Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, has done a 
tremendous job in explaining the exceptional problems that our 
intelligence community continues to encounter based on antiquated 
sections of the law. When the United States Director of National 
Intelligence says our country is at risk, I hope we are listening. Let 
me read a quote that Director McConnell recently stated:




 Many Americans would be surprised at just what the current 


 law requires. To state the facts plainly: In a significant 


 number of cases, our intelligence agencies must obtain a 


 court order to monitor the communications of foreigners 


 suspected of terrorist activity who are physically located in 


 foreign countries. We are in this situation because the law 


 simply has not kept pace with technology.


This is a powerful statement that Director McConnell gives. However, 
I must disagree with one thing he says. I don't think most Americans 
would be ''surprised'' by what our current law requires, I think most 
Americans would be outraged by what our current law requires. A 
terrorist in Afghanistan speaks with a terrorist in Iraq, and U.S. 
intelligence agencies need a court order to listen to this 
conversation?

This is absurd.

We need to bring FISA back to its original intent to protect the 
rights and privacy of American individuals while allowing us to monitor 
foreign individuals outside of the United States.

The President of the United States has also recognized the perilous 
situation in which we find ourselves. In his radio address last 
weekend, he stated that ''Our intelligence community warns that under 
the current statute, we are missing a significant amount of foreign 
intelligence that we should be collecting to protect our country.''

Let's look closely at this. Our intelligence community is saying that 
we are missing a significant amount of foreign intelligence. Why are we 
missing this intelligence? Is it because we don't know how to get it?

No.

Is it because we don't have the ability or funds to get it?

No.

Is it because terrorist groups have technology that we can't exploit?

No.

It is because a law passed in 1978 has not been appropriately amended 
to conform with the technological advances that we have seen since that 
time. Why are we handcuffing ourselves?

I believe most Americans would look at this situation and simply 
shake their heads.

If we know we have a problem, and we know how to fix it, why don't 
we? Is the excuse that we might not have enough time before recess?

Of course we have time.

We'll make time.

It is outrageous that we would even consider a recess while this 
problem and other loopholes of the FISA law remain intact.

If we can't get this done, why are we here? It is no wonder that the 
approval ratings for Congress are approaching all time lows.

Quite simply, we have a problem, but we know how to fix it. I note 
that Senator Bond has introduced a straight


forward measure which we can pass today.

This bill will put the tools back in the hands of the people who work 
tirelessly in providing a safe environment for American families 
throughout this great country.

This amendment of FISA simply returns the law to its original intent, 
which is twofold: first, allowing surveillance of foreign targets, who 
were never underprotected under FISA; and second, guaranteeing the 
privacy and rights of U.S. persons, who remain protected.

It is time to address this situation. I would ask my colleagues to 
join me in pledging to pass legislation in this area before we recess. 
This is not about partisan politics.

This is about protecting Americans. We are all painfully aware of the 
continued dangers that our country continues to face at the hands of 
organized groups and dedicated individuals who desire nothing more than 
the collapse of our country as a superpower.

This is not a case of the boy who cried wolf. We know the threats are 
out there. However, each day that passes creates emotional distance 
between the nightmares of September 11, and each new day provides 
opportunities to heal.

We don't have to live our lives in fear, but we have to acknowledge 
that the world changed that day. Rather than obsessing over news 
reports, let's enjoy the tremendous opportunities that the greatest 
Nation on Earth provides.

And let's ensure that all of the dedicated and noble professionals 
who play a part in ensuring our liberty and safety are not hampered by 
nonpartisan problems that we have the ability to fix.

We always hear that the terrorists have an asymmetrical advantage 
over us: They do not operate as nation-states, and some of them are 
willing to die as suicide bombers.

But we have a massive asymmetrical advantage over them: Our 
technological prowess.

Are we to compromise one of our greatest strengths, when that 
strength is essential, effective and lawful?

I remind my colleagues that even though we will return to our States 
for the recess, our enemies and their threats don't go away. They don't 
adjust their schedules to fit ours.

Make no mistake, inaction on our part needlessly subjects every 
American to increased danger. We need to act.

We have two options: Cut into August recess if necessary to provide 
safety to Americans, or go home and leave this vulnerability intact.

The answer is an easy one: Let's ensure that our defenders have all 
of the tools they need for our continued safety, no matter how long it 
takes.

I urge my colleagues to join me in pledging to pass FISA 
modernization legislation before our recess. I yield the floor.
