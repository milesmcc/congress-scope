Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank my friend, Judge Poe, for yielding a 
couple of minutes to me.

Mr. Speaker, I want to rise in absolute support of this bill. The 
Korean war has been called the Forgotten War. The Vietnam war is the 
war of forgotten veterans. I served in the Marine Corps. I actually had 
a commission in the Navy and, later on, in the Air Force. As one who 
believes in the Constitution as our Founding Fathers meant it when they 
wrote it, I know that national defense is the number one issue that 
this Congress should focus upon more so than anything else, and we 
ought to give--it is right to give; it is due to give--recognition to 
these brave men and women who were engaged in the conflict in Korea.

We signed an armistice with the Koreans, and technically, we're still 
at war there. We still have veterans who are missing in action from 
many wars. We still have veterans who are stationed all over this world 
in an effort to maintain freedom in America. So it's absolutely 
critical that we recognize our veterans, not only from the Korean war 
but from all wars, whether it's World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert 
Storm, Iraqi Freedom, or the war that's ongoing in Afghanistan.

I hope that America will pause and will thank the service men and 
women who have put on a uniform, who have given their time, their 
efforts, their limbs, their eyes, their lives to protect freedom in 
America.

So I congratulate the Members who have brought this very important 
legislation to the floor. I thank my friend Mr. Rangel from New York 
for his service to the Nation. I thank all members of the military for 
serving this Nation. I very ardently support this.

I appreciate, Judge Poe, your yielding me some time.
