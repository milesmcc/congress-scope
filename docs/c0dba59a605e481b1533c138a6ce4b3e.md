Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, over the past few years this 
administration has been beating the drums of war against Iran. There 
are parallels against their efforts to try to create a war against Iran 
and the falsehoods that set us on the path to war against Iraq. We know 
that the United States intelligence community was able to demonstrate 
that the administration's claims that Iran had a nuclear weapons 
program were in fact not true.

The January 6 incident at the Strait of Hormuth is still another 
cause for this Congress to look deeply at the administration's Iranian 
war buildup, because it appears from news reports that the Department 
of Defense grossly inflated an encounter that took place in the strait, 
an encounter that was not like any that had taken place before, and 
then not only inflated it, but fabricated information that would cause 
the American people to believe that Iran was demonstrating military 
aggressiveness.

We really have to get off the path of war towards Iran and start 
working on building diplomatic relations.
