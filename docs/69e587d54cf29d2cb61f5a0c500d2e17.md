Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is truly incomprehensible that 
there are those who believe that the best course of action in the face 
of a determined enemy is to tell them that we are less determined. Yet 
that is exactly what this Iraq supplemental financing bill does.

What message do we send our brave military men and women when we 
won't guarantee them the resources and the equipment that they need 
without including a litany of restrictive and arbitrary timetables?

What will our soldiers on the front lines of this war think when they 
hear they have been sold for salmon fisheries and spinach growers, 
money used to buy votes?

This Iraq supplemental bill is just one more step in what has become 
a long list of unprecedented attempts by this majority to accept defeat 
at any cost.

For those of us in Washington, we get to face this moment in the 
warmth and the comfort of our homes and offices. For so many Americans, 
they will face this moment in the harsh reality of a war zone. We must 
not forget what is at stake. Our military will not, and the American 
people will not.
