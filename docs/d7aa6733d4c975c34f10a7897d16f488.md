Mr. FOSTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of an amendment to optimize the 
technological posture of our Armed Forces, but I am also the son of a 
civil rights lawyer who wrote a lot of the enforcement language behind 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And I am proud to serve with our majority 
leader and the representative of the Pennsylvania Eighth district.

I rise in support of an amendment which would direct the Secretary of 
Defense to commission an independent study assessing the optimal 
balance of manned versus unmanned aircraft, as well as whether our 
military is capable of defending against an enemy force consisting of 
unmanned aerial vehicles. I believe it's the duty of Congress to ask 
hard questions and to take the long view of matters on national 
security.

In Afghanistan and Iraq, we've already seen how UAV technology has 
revolutionized warfare and how rapidly we can launch an attack half a 
world away without risking a single American life. Between 2002 and 
2008, the number of unmanned aircraft used by the Department of Defense 
increased from 167 to over 6,000. This year for the first time in 
history, the Air Force trained more UAV pilots than traditional fighter 
pilots.

This amendment will help us optimize the balance between manned and 
unmanned aircraft, and I urge its support.
