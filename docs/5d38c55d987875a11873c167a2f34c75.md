`Mr. COLEMAN â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my experience is much like the Senator 
from Alabama. When I was there in the fall, it was described to me as 
the ''Wild West'' and it was not very uplifting. When I was there in 
April, we had Minnesota National Guard soldiers who were serving in 
Anbar Province, and they told me of an incident in a town called 
Habbaniya, where a suicide bomber drove into a crowd coming out of a 
mosque, killing or wounding 70 Iraqis. It was the American soldiers and 
National Guardsmen giving blood, even though not a single American had 
been hurt or injured.

Then they told me, the next day, or shortly thereafter, the local 
mayor and the local sheik came in with a list of al-Qaida operatives 
and said: These are the enemy. We want to work with you side by side to 
root them out.

I ask the Senator, in your experience there, have you also seen 
incidents or heard of incidents where the brutality of al-Qaida against 
Sunnis has evoked a response from local sheiks and local elected 
officials to work side by side with the Americans--be they the Marines, 
Army, or National Guard?
