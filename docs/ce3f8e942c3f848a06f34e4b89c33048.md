Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in the past weeks 
terrorists with possible al Qaeda ties have attempted car bombings in 
London. Following these failed attempts, terrorists struck the Glasgow, 
Scotland airport. This attack by two doctors in a flaming Jeep 
Cherokee, doctors who have been sworn to protect life, were arrested 
for attempting mass murder by incineration of innocent civilians.

In addition, terrorists held children captive in a mosque in 
Islamabad, Pakistan; and an al Qaeda homicide bomber in Yemen murdered 
seven Spanish tourists and two Yemeni guides while they were visiting a 
temple of the ancient Queen of Sheba.

Recent events such as this should alert Americans that the global war 
on terrorism is a worldwide threat and that Iraq and Afghanistan remain 
the central front of the battle as claimed by bin Laden's spokesman 
Zawahiri.

Instead of practicing party politics, Congress should rely on the 
leadership of our military leaders such as General David Petraeus. By 
stopping terrorists overseas, our troops are protecting America's 
families at home.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th.
