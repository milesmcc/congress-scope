Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, three points. First, why is this 
an emergency? It is an emergency because the administration has never 
funded this war on the books. The people who will pay for this are the 
sons and the daughters of the men and women in the military who are now 
fighting it. That is wrong and irresponsible.

Number 2, the military has done its job. They were asked to get rid 
of Saddam. He's gone. Find weapons of mass destruction. They don't 
exist. And allow Iraq to have democratic elections. They have had 
three.

Third point, the President says ''no'' to timetables. Of course we 
must have timetables. How else to hold the Iraqi politicians 
responsible? They have to have an oil law. They have to renounce 
sectarianism in the security force. And the only way that we are going 
to stop asking our military and our taxpayers to referee a civil war 
and to finance it is by having the President of the United States do 
what he must do and say we want accountability from the Iraqi political 
leadership.
