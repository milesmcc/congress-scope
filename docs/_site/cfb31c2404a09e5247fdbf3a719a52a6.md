Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released 
survey data showing unsettling numbers on the employment rates of newly 
returning veterans. Last year, the unemployment rate for our Iraqi and 
Afghanistan veterans was over 10 percent. Even more disturbing were 
figures showing that the jobless rate of younger veterans exceeded 20 
percent.

Congressman Harry Teague, a first-term member of our committee from 
New Mexico, proposed an innovative way to provide training for veterans 
in the energy industry. He introduced this act, H.R. 4592, the Energy 
Jobs for Veterans Act.

I would yield to Mr. Teague for further explanation of the bill.
