Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to the men and 
women of Alabama's Army National Guard.

Alabama has distinguished itself by having sent more Army National 
Guard troops to Iraq and Afghanistan than any other State except Texas 
since September 11, 2001. As of December 2006, a total of 7,068 men and 
women have been deployed to these two fronts: 6,281 Alabama Army 
National Guard troops to Iraq and 787 to Afghanistan.

The men and women of Alabama's Army National Guard should not simply 
be commended for their bravery, but for their dedication and commitment 
to the cause of freedom. Alabama's Army National Guard continues to 
distinguish itself through brave and honorable service, which is 
evident from the numerous awards and decorations conferred upon many 
units of Alabama's Army National Guard. These high deployment levels 
confirm that Alabama's Army National Guard units are equipped with the 
necessary skills to meet the United States military's mission 
requirements in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The dedication of the men and women of Alabama's Army National Guard, 
as well as the vision and leadership of the officers in charge, has 
brought honor to the Guard, their fellow Alabamians, and fellow 
Americans. They and their families have sacrificed much, while some 
have paid the ultimate price ensuring our freedom. The diversity of 
units sent to Iraq and Afghanistan includes medical, engineering, water 
purification, military police, special forces transportation, and 
communication units. Currently, seven of Alabama's Army National Guard 
units are serving in Iraq, comprised of approximately 1,100 troops, and 
others around the State are on alert awaiting possible deployment.

It is an honor for me to rise today and recognize the brave men and 
women of America's armed forces, and in particular, the brave men and 
women of Alabama's Army National Guard. May their dedication to the 
cause of freedom be an example to their families, friends, neighbors 
and citizens throughout Alabama and across the United States of 
America.
