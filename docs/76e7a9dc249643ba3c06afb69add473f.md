Mr. GILCHREST. I thank the gentleman.

Just very quickly on the comment from the gentleman from New York, 
Syria is basically a secular country. It is not an Islamic state. It is 
secular. They feared al Qaeda and the Taliban, and they don't want al 
Qaeda in Iraq creating chaos. Al Qaeda was basically the enemy of the 
Iranians. It was the enemy of Iraq. It was a disruptive factor in the 
Middle East.

So careful analysis of each country, using the best diplomats in the 
world that the United States has, has the potential for unraveling this 
very difficult, chaotic situation. We know we need a military presence 
in the Middle East, we know we need a political presence in the Middle 
East, and we know we need an economic presence in the Middle East. With 
the emphasis on the politics and the economics with the Middle Eastern 
countries, I think we can back our way out of this chaos.
