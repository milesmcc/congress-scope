Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose more funding for a war 
in Afghanistan that has cost too much and accomplished too little.

Over 1,000 soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan. The toll of this 
conflict is not limited to the battlefield. This year, almost as many 
American troops have committed suicide as have been killed in combat. 
Our troops and their families are paying an extreme price to wage a war 
that has no clear objective.

The war has also destabilized Afghanistan. Estimates from 
international human rights organizations range from 10,000 to 12,000 
Afghanis killed as a result of the war. Now, we are preparing to spend 
$33 billion more in Afghanistan. We should spend this money on 
infrastructure--like schools and roads--that will open opportunities 
for all of Afghanistan. That is the best way to achieve peace and 
stability in the region.

Every dollar we waste on war is one less dollar we can invest in our 
children here at home. I support the Obey amendment that will add $10 
billion in domestic education funds to the bill. These funds, though 
inadequate, will protect hundreds of thousands of teacher jobs across 
the country, including 167 in my district.

While I hope for the inclusion of this education funding, I cannot 
support any more funding for the misguided war in Afghanistan. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in voting no.
