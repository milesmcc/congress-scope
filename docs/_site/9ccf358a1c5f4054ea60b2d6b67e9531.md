Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Skelton and 
Ranking Member Hunter for including my amendment in this package.

My amendment provides certainty to servicemembers deployed in a 
contingency operation that their child custody arrangements will be 
protected.

In some cases, courts are overturning established custody 
arrangements while the custodial parent is serving our country in a 
contingency operation, such as Iraq or Afghanistan.

States have become aware of this issue and are looking at what action 
they can take to support our men and women in uniform. The State of 
Michigan passed a law in 2005 to provide these protections to military 
personnel. The amendment offered today is modeled after the established 
Michigan law.

Much is asked of our servicemembers, and mobilizations can disrupt 
and strain relationships at home. This additional protection is needed 
to provide them peace of mind that the courts will not take away their 
children because they answered the country's call to serve. This 
amendment protects them and it protects their children.

Again, I thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for 
supporting this important amendment.
