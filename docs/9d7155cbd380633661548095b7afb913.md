`Mr. BOREN â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. BOREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our men and women 
in uniform, and in support of this resolution.

Nearly 230,000 Americans are currently deployed to the Middle East 
fighting the war on terrorism. Three thousand of those are from my home 
State of Oklahoma. These men and women are fighting for their country, 
not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as Americans.

I was not in Congress nearly 4 years ago when the war in Iraq began, 
but in the 2 years since I have served here I have not once encountered 
a colleague who does not support our troops. We have our disagreements 
over strategy, spending and even the war itself, but when it comes to 
support for the selfless Americans serving in uniform, we are 
unanimous.

For anyone, and I repeat, anyone to suggest anything to the contrary 
just distracts from this serious, serious debate.



As many of my colleagues have already noted, our troops are not the 
problem. They have done an outstanding job executing the mission that 
they have been given. The problem is with the administration's 
strategy. We owe it to the men and women of our Armed Forces to pursue 
a policy that offers them the best possible chance at success, not a 
plan that repeats past mistakes.

The President's decision to deploy an additional 21,500 American 
combat troops to Iraq is not the first time that we have had a surge of 
troops in this conflict. In April of 2004, January and October of 2005, 
and again in October of last year, we saw temporary escalations that 
provided no long-term reductions in violence. I am concerned that this 
latest plan is a renewed effort


for more of the same that does little to encourage the Iraqis to take 
responsibility for their own future. As one general told the Iraq Study 
Group, ''All the troops in the world will not provide security if the 
Iraqi Government does not make political progress.'' Rather than laying 
out a plan that establishes solid benchmarks for Iraqi security and the 
corresponding redeployment of U.S. troops, the President is pursuing a 
strategy that history shows does not work.

Former Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin 
Powell, Commander of the U.S. Central Command General John Abizaid, 
Marine Corps Commandant General James Conway, and many other current 
and former military leaders have said more troops is not the answer. 
Our Nation's military is already stretched thin. This open-ended plan 
to increase American troop levels in Iraq would exacerbate the 
overextension of our Armed Forces and cripple our ability to respond to 
other crises around the world. Because we don't know what the future 
holds, we have to be ready for anything.

U.S. and coalition forces successfully removed Saddam Hussein from 
power, and the world is a better place for it. But we now find 
ourselves locked in the middle of an Iraqi civil war. The Iraq of today 
is vastly different from the Iraq we entered nearly 4 years ago, yet 
our strategy remains the same. We need to succeed in Iraq, but we need 
to redefine what success really is.

For over a year now I have joined our great chairman, Chairman 
Skelton, in his call for solid benchmarks in Iraq. We need a mechanism 
to measure our progress toward an Iraq that is responsible for its own 
security. It is in our interest, it is in Iraq's interest, and it is in 
the interest of the region to ensure that Iraqi personnel are trained 
and ready to take control sooner rather than later. Realistically, some 
of the more than 140,000 troops we already have in Iraq to secure the 
Iranian border would do more to further our goals in Iraq than sending 
more Americans into Baghdad. And that is a plan, my friends.

At the end of the day, military command decisions rest with the 
Commander in Chief. This resolution and this debate are not about 
micromanaging the war or forcing a withdrawal of troops. Public opinion 
polls should not dictate war strategies. The facts should. And the 
facts are that surges haven't worked in the past and experts agree it 
won't work this time.

The President knows we are all in this together. That is why I was 
very disappointed to see the administration move forward with such a 
dramatic escalation despite strong bipartisan opposition in Congress. 
Without a clear mission or effective benchmarks, it is too big of a 
gamble to take with so many American lives.
