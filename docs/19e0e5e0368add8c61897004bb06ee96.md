Mr. DURBIN. He, of course, wants us to only allow a registry for Lou 
Gehrig's patients if we will allow a debate on providing $50 billion, 
$60 billion, $70 billion more for the war in Iraq--not paid for--and 
that it happen immediately, even though we have been told by the 
military they have enough funds to continue this war until at least the 
end of February, the first of March.

Well, that is the price we would have to pay under the Republican 
agenda to bring up a bill for the Lou Gehrig's registry. That is sad, 
and it shows you the extremes they will go to to stop even the most 
benign and bipartisan bill we can think of.
