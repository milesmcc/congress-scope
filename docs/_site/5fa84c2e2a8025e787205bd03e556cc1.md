Mr. NEUGEBAUER. We are talking about this civil war. One of the 
interesting things in Fallujah is we sat down, and at the table, across 
the table, was the police chief of Fallujah. Sitting next to him was a 
colonel in the Iraqi Army. The interesting thing about that meeting, 
one is Sunni, the other is Shiite. Yet they are working side by side to 
make sure that Fallujah, the streets of Fallujah, are again a place 
where families can walk and commerce can take place.

One of the interesting things that I saw on this trip, each trip I 
have seen progress. On this particular trip, I saw a lot more people 
out in the farmlands. What a lot of people don't know about Iraq is 
that at one time they were an exporter of agricultural products. This 
is a region of the world that is rich in a lot of natural resources. 
One of those is water.

But more people were engaged in the streets. We flew at night. We 
flew from Ramadi into Baghdad, flying over the city, a lot more lights, 
a lot more electricity on, not just in the city but out in the 
countryside. These are the kinds of things that are going to build that 
Nation.

To pull the plug after we have invested all of the lives and the 
resources into this initiative at this particular point in time is 
really unconscionable for our country even to consider that. I am 
concerned that a lot of people don't realize, as you said, what is 
really at stake here.
