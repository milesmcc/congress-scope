Mr. KUCINICH. I will use the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, this is starting to sound like the debate over Iraq.

My concerns are that this resolution is opposed to our national 
security, that it undermines diplomatic initiatives, that it creates a 
gas shortage in Iran which, in a sense, the regime would blame on the 
United States. It will benefit the Revolutionary Guard in its effort to 
gain profit off of a black market. It will throw the energy politics of 
the world into chaos with Russia, Venezuela and our European allies all 
coming in to play. It will undermine our diplomacy. It will isolate us 
from our allies. It will isolate us from trading partners. It will 
undercut international energy companies which try to work with the 
United States in back channels in diplomacy. It will undermine 
democracy efforts in Iran, and it will strengthen the hardliners. It 
will make U.S. presence in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan more 
dangerous for our troops.

This sanctions resolution is, unfortunately, a path towards military 
escalation. As such, it should be defeated.

I yield back the balance of my time.
