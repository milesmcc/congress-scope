# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mr. HENSARLING â€” 15 February 2007`

---


Mr. HENSARLING. First, I want to thank my dear friend, and a genuine 
American hero, for yielding time to me today.

Mr. Speaker, speaker after speaker on the other side of the aisle 
have come to the floor to speak against the past decision to go into 
Iraq. They criticize past lapses of intelligence, they criticize past 
actions, they criticize past setbacks. They want to live in the past.

Regardless of whose war this was in the past, today it is an American 
war. And the Democratic majority must decide do they support the 
mission, or do they not support the mission?

Now, certainly we are all disappointed that we have not achieved the 
success that we would have desired by now. And I myself do not know if 
the new strategy will prove successful. I think it can be successful. I 
hope it will be successful. And I know it is a strategy that has been 
recommended by the Iraqi Study Group and our new battlefield commander.

So until such a time as somebody comes to me with a more compelling 
strategy, or until somebody convinces me that somehow my Nation and my 
family will be more secure by our premature withdrawal from Iraq and 
subsequent implosion, I feel I must support this new strategy. I will 
support this new strategy. Defeat is not an option.

What are the options, Mr. Speaker? Clearly, many. Many, if not most, 
of my Democrat colleagues want to cut off funding for our troops and 
withdraw from Iraq. This is well known. And I respect their views when 
they are heartfelt. But since Democrats control a majority in both 
houses of Congress, why are we voting on a nonbinding withdrawal 
resolution?



That is why this is a sad day. Somewhere over in Baghdad right now is 
a marine sergeant who is tired, he is resolute, he has dirt on his 
face. But you know what? He volunteered, he loves America, he loves his 
freedom. He has a picture in his wallet. His parents are praying for 
him. He is thinking about his wife.

Who, who in this body, what Member can go to that marine and say, you 
know what? I don't believe in your mission. I don't believe you can 
succeed. I don't believe you can win, and I am going to oppose 
reinforcements. Guess what? I have the power to bring you home, but I 
am just not willing to do it. Because if I do it now everyone will know 
it, and I have to take responsibility, and I am just not willing to do 
that.

Mr. Speaker, if you believe in something, stand up for it. Where is 
the courage? Where is the conviction in a nonbinding resolution?

Mr. Speaker, we all know that fighting this war is costly. Like many 
Members of this body, I have met with the mothers of the fallen 
soldiers. Their burden and sacrifice is profound. But I never, never, 
never want to meet with the mothers whose children may perish in the 
next 9/11 if we accept defeat in Iraq.

Iraq must be seen in the larger context of the war with radical 
Islam, and whether we like it or not, the battle lines are drawn in 
Iraq. Don't take my word for it, listen to what the jihadists have to 
say. Listen to Osama bin Laden, ''The epicenter of these wars is 
Baghdad. Success in Baghdad will be success for the United States. 
Failure in Iraq is the failure of the United States. Their defeat in 
Iraq will mean defeat in all their wars.''

We must soberly reflect on the challenge that we face. Listen to al-
Zawahiri, who is number two in command. ''Al Qaeda has the right to 
kill 4 million Americans, 2 million of them children.''

Listen to Hassan Abbassi, Revolutionary Guard's intelligence adviser 
to the Iranian President. ''We have a strategy drawn up for the 
destruction of Anglo-Saxon civilization.''

Listen to Iraqi Ayatollah Ahmad Husseini. ''Even if this means using 
biological, chemical and bacterial weapons, we will conquer the 
world.''

This is the enemy we face, and we face him foremost in Iraq. If we 
leave Iraq before subduing him, he will follow us to America. Make no 
doubt about it, the consequences in Iraq are immense. Don't take my 
word for it. Read the report of the Iraq Study Group. Read the National 
Intelligence Estimate. Read the work of the Middle East scholars at the 
American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation, Brookings 
Institute.

If we do not pursue success, Iraq will become what Afghanistan once 
was. It will be a breeding ground, a safe haven for the recruitment, 
training, financing and sanctuary of radical Islamists bent upon 
attacking our Nation and our families. We cannot wish it away, we 
cannot hope it away, we cannot dream it away. There will be no greater 
event to empower radical Islam than our defeat in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, it doesn't have to be this way. We are Americans. We can 
meet this threat. We can work together. Vote against this resolution. 
Support our troops. Protect our Nation and our children from this 
threat.
