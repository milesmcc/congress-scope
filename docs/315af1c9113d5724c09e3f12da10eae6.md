Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. There is no 
question that we must reform our entitlement programs and change the 
way our Nation's finances are managed.

With this in mind, I support the premise behind this amendment: the 
Social Security trust fund should not be used to help reduce the 
Federal budget deficit.

Hundreds of billions of dollars are being taken from Social Security 
each year just to help pay our bills. Last year, this figure approached 
$200 billion.

However, this amendment has a fatal flaw. It leaves the door open for 
private Social Security accounts by providing participants with the 
option of ''pre-funding of at least some portion of future benefits.''

In my view, this is unacceptable.

This body has already closed the door on the President's ill-
conceived plan for private Social Security accounts.

The opposition to privatization is well-known:

Privatizing Social Security does nothing to extend the solvency of 
the program. Transition costs alone, over the first 20 years, would put 
our Nation in greater debt by as much as $4.9 trillion.

Creating private accounts would mean benefit cuts for retirees, by as 
much as 40 percent.

Half of all American workers today have no pension or retirement plan 
from their employers. That means Social Security is their only source 
of income.

It is critical that we protect this safety net.

We must hold the line on spending, but this has to be done in 
conjunction with a more responsible approach to tax policy.

The President's tax cuts have already cost more than $1 trillion and 
those enacted will be more than $3 trillion over the next decade.

When you combine the cost of the tax cuts with spending for the 
military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the global war on 
terror--currently totaling $510 billion--the inevitable result is that 
our Federal budget is squeezed, while our crushing debt grows.

As we debate this budget resolution, I urge my colleagues to be 
mindful of the long-term impact of our spending decisions.

The looming crisis with our entitlement programs is clear. We must 
stop raiding the Social Security trust fund to pay our bills. But I 
cannot support this particular amendment which opens the door to 
privatizing Social Security.

I am firmly committed to opposing any Social Security reform 
proposals which leave the possibility of private accounts on the table. 
And this amendment would do just that. So I must voice my opposition, 
and I ask that my colleagues join me in rejecting this proposal.
