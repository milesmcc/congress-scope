Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Here is the difference we are starting to see. When 
Members turn on the television, Mr. Speaker, and they see what is 
happening with the Attorney General's Office, when they hear about $10-
12 billion in Iraq that nobody knows where it is, and now all of this 
information that is coming out, hearing about the gulf coast, hearing 
about Halliburton. If a truck blows a tire, Halliburton puts in for 
another truck instead of putting a new tire on the truck.
