Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3326, the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act.

The bill extends unemployment and COBRA benefits, which I have fought 
for and continue to support.

It also funds a number of employment, medical, and transportation 
programs that I also support.

Nevertheless, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill because it 
continues funding for our futile efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which 
have already cost our country too much in blood and treasure.

Instead of pursuing military action where there is no military 
solution, we need a new strategy that relies on the effective tools of 
what I call smart security.

These tools include diplomacy, humanitarian aid, economic 
development, education, civil affairs, and better intelligence and 
police work to search out and capture extremists.

In the case of Afghanistan, for example, a great majority of all 
further funding should be devoted to these smart security efforts.

Madam Speaker, let's change our strategy before it's too late. We can 
begin by voting against this bill.
