## `f22d3f2ba4832baa22aa384fe37bfd4f`
`Mr. BISHOP of New York â€” 6 November 2007`

Mr. BISHOP of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I 
also thank her for her leadership on this very important bill.

Mr. Speaker, a congressional override of this Presidential veto is 
absolutely imperative to ensure the safety and viability of our 
Nation's water infrastructure.

For the President to veto this legislation under the guise of fiscal 
responsibility is hypocritical at best. The tab for the President's 
endless war in Iraq is now in excess of $600 billion and counting. Just 
the interest on the amount we have borrowed to fund the war is $25 
billion per year, an amount that exceeds the authorized level of this 
legislation. This veto is a stark reminder that the hundreds of 
billions of dollars spent on the war in Iraq has been at the expense of 
pressing priorities here at home.

In the 5 years since the war began, over $45 billion has been spent 
on restoring the infrastructure in Iraq. This is double the $23 billion 
price tag a bipartisan majority of Congress seeks now to address a 7-
year backlog of much-needed projects.



When it comes to domestic priorities, the President has decided 
against investing in America. He has vetoed expanding health care for 
children, he has vetoed research for life-threatening diseases, he has 
vetoed benchmarks for Iraq, and has threatened vetoes on investments 
ranging from education to law enforcement. Are these vetoes the 
priorities of America, or are they the misplaced priorities of an 
administration hopelessly out of step with the American people?

Mr. Speaker, the Water Resources Development Act benefits all 
Americans and their families who use and enjoy our Nation's waterways. 
My district benefits from the good work that the Army Corps of 
Engineers does for coastal communities by helping small towns deal with 
multiple concerns ranging from erosion to longstanding environmental 
challenges.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1495 will go a long way towards supplying the Corps 
with the resources it needs to protect coastal communities by 
modernizing project planning and approval. We simply cannot afford to 
let another year go by without passing this legislation.

I urge my colleagues to override the President's veto.
