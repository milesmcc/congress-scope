# ENSURING MILITARY READINESS THROUGH STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY  DEPLOYMENT POLICY ACT OF 2007
## `0d5d6309064f67bd4682f2f459ee9a5c`
`Mr. ANDREWS â€” 2 August 2007`

Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my friend for yielding and I rise in strong 
support of her legislation.

Mr. Speaker, there is no disagreement that we should do only what is 
right for our troops in the field and keep them safe, but there is a 
disagreement over the meaning of article I of the Constitution of the 
United States.

Conduct of the foreign policy of this country is not the exclusive 
purview of the executive branch, but for too long in this institution 
we have behaved as if it is. So this bill says that it is about time 
that the Congress of the United States took on our responsibility for 
assessing the problems in Iraq, took on our responsibility to provide 
for the common defense. Not to be a spectator as the executive branch 
makes these decisions in isolation but to be a thoughtful and full 
partner in that decision-making process.

It is very important for the Members to understand that if the 
President feels that there is an impairment to the national security of 
the country, he has the authority to waive the provisions of this bill. 
But, absent that, he should abide by it.

Please vote ''yes.''
