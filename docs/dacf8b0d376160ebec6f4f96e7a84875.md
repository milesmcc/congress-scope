Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 3087, and I thank my colleagues, all of you, for 
getting it here to the floor. I voted for this bill in the Armed 
Services Committee with bipartisan support. It passed 55-2, and I think 
this is the beginning of the way. I'm happy that we're trying to find a 
way to move in Iraq.

We are here today because after more than 4 years of the President's 
war, it has become painfully clear that the administration didn't 
adequately plan for this war. Plan. Planning. And this is what this 
bill is about. And that the administration really didn't understand the 
substantial investment that it was going to take for American troops 
beyond the initial invasion. In fact, when the President declared 
''Mission Accomplished'' on May 1, 2003, we had only lost 139 of our 
troops in Iraq; however, since then, 3,660 of our troops have been 
lost. So the American people have called for a redeploying of our 
troops from Iraq, and we need to start doing it, and we need a plan to 
do that redeployment.

So today, with this legislation, Congress is mandating that proper 
planning be done, so that whenever the redeployment begins, our troops 
will be brought home safely to their families.
