Mr. MICA. Madam Speaker, as we recognize Memorial Day 2010, I wanted 
to remember each of the American Service Members from Florida's 7th 
Congressional District who have lost their life to hostile actions 
since 1996 as reported to me by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Let us remember all those who have fallen in service to our Nation. 
Let us never forget those who have served and paid the ultimate price 
so that we can live in this great land.

We must forever keep these heroes in our thoughts and prayers. Let us 
today, on Memorial Day and every day, thank the good Lord for their 
incredible sacrifice.

They have made it possible for all Americans to live in freedom. Let 
us also remember and pay tribute to the families and loved ones whose 
loss is immeasurable.

On Memorial Day and every day, let us continue in our hearts and 
minds to hold dearly all those who have served and are serving this 
Nation.

May God continue to bless the United States of America.
