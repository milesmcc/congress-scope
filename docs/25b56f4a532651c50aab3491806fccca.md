Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.

Just remember, a decision at this point to give up on Pakistan, it is 
Pakistan that is providing sanctuary for the people who are fighting us 
in Afghanistan. It is Pakistan who has nuclear weapons.

I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).
