Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I would just say to my colleagues, 
including the gentleman from Washington who spoke I think somewhat 
disparagingly of the President, this is part of the duties of an 
administration anywhere where you have American troops. You lay down 
rules of how they are going to be treated with respect to civil 
actions, criminal actions, licensing of vehicles, payment of taxes, all 
the things that affect a person who is now physically residing in that 
foreign country, whether it's an American civilian or a military guy 
who's stationed there. It's a necessary thing.

The idea that we are going to elevate this thing, which has been a 
fairly ministerial thing, to a treaty on the basis that the people who 
are speaking don't like the President doesn't make any sense. You know, 
when the Secretary of Defense comes in, testifies to our committee that 
there will be no commitments manifest in this particular SOFA with 
respect to security, he testifies to us to that effect, the idea that 
we say we are not going to believe him, and certain members of the 
other side don't like the President so they come down to say anything 
he does now has to be ratified by Congress, I think that disparages the 
process, Mr. Chairman.

We have got a fairly run-of-the-mill ministerial thing that we need 
to do and, once again, I say to my colleagues, this protects American 
personnel. The same team that has negotiated this with presumably 
dozens of countries and gone over the same ministerial stuff with 
respect to how people are treated in that country, will be talking to 
the Iraqi leadership and making that same negotiation on those same 
points.

So the idea that we now elevate this to a treaty; if a treaty is 
coming with this strategic framework, that does have to be ratified by 
Congress, and should be ratified by Congress. But let's not mix the two 
up. Let's protect our personnel and then let's move to this 
ratification or this decision of what any security commitments might 
be.

I would reserve the balance of my time.
