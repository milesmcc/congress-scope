# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mrs. JO ANN DAVIS of Virginia â€” 16 February 2007`

Mrs. JO ANN DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, due to my recovery from 
a medical procedure, I regret that I am unable to participate in the 
debate on the resolution that is before the House of Representatives 
today. The Iraq War Resolution offered by the Democratic majority is 
nothing more than a political exercise, and does nothing to support our 
troops or help solve the issues that we are facing in Iraq. The 
resolution offers no solutions or recommendations, but instead 
criticizes an action that is already underway. As ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Military Readiness in the House Armed Services 
Committee, I am open to supporting legislation that actually presents 
solutions to stabilizing Iraq. Unfortunately, this resolution does not 
provide anything other than criticism, and I would have opposed this 
resolution if I had been in Washington, DC for the vote.
