Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for her 
thoughtfulness and leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor.



I rise in strong support of H. Res. 305. Mr. Speaker, next week will 
mark the 27th anniversary of Operation Eagle Claw, better known to most 
Americans as ''Desert One,'' which the distinguished chairman mentioned 
moments ago.

On April 24, 1980, a task force consisting of Army special forces, 
Army Rangers, Air Force special operations wing personnel and the Navy, 
Marines and Air Force succeeded in moving thousands of miles, 
undetected, until reaching a remote location in the Iranian desert 200 
miles from Tehran in an effort to rescue the American hostages being 
held at the American Embassy.

A combination of helicopters and C-130 aircraft rendezvoused with the 
intention of rescuing these hostages in Tehran the following evening. 
Due to mechanical failures and weather problems, only six out of eight 
helicopters successfully arrived at the Desert One rendezvous. Once the 
six helicopters arrived, the rescue attempt was dealt a final blow when 
it was learned that one of the helicopters had lost its primary 
hydraulic system.

As the various aircraft began moving into position to return to their 
respective launching points, one of the helicopters, flown by one of my 
very best friends, collided with a C-130 aircraft on the ground. Flames 
engulfed the helicopter and the C-130, which resulted in the death of 
five airmen and three marines.

During my 25 years in the Marine Corps, I had the good fortune to 
know many of the heroes of that day, and I did, in fact, count many of 
them as my best friends. These brave men were asked, and all proudly 
volunteered, to undertake the challenge of rescuing their fellow 
Americans in a mission of the utmost secrecy and gravest danger.

Members from all branches of our armed services came together, 
bringing with them the best of skills and experience, but it was not 
enough to do the job. In the end, inadequate equipment, tremendous dust 
storms, extraordinary logistical challenges contributed to the 
mission's failure. But these circumstances in no way diminished the 
skill and bravery of the men who took on this hazardous mission against 
all odds.

Out of the ashes of Operation Eagle Claw arose the organization that 
we honor today. In 1986, Congress established a new unified command for 
special operations forces, designated as the U.S. Special Operations 
Command. And today we gratefully honor the 20th anniversary of SOCOM's 
founding and the men and women who fill its ranks.

Like their predecessors, the men and women that comprise today's 
special operations forces have accepted the challenge of tackling some 
of the most difficult and dangerous missions assigned to our military. 
As we have witnessed in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, the 
Philippines and in many other locations across the globe, they have 
handled these missions with honor and skillful professionalism.

To those who perished in Operation Eagle Claw and the many SOCOM 
missions since then, we offer our sincere appreciation. And to those 
who carry on their noble mission, we pledge our Nation's support.
