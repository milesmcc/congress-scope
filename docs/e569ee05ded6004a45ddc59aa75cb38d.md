Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me just say, finally, we are going into 
this Memorial Day weekend. I have the honor of participating in seven 
Memorial Day events on Monday in southern California, and I will be 
meeting with family members.

Just yesterday, I met with the mother of a young man, Mr. Colnot, who 
lost his life over a year ago in Iraq. She said to me just yesterday 
afternoon, ''It is absolutely essential that we complete our mission.''

I have regularly pointed to another one of my constituents whose son 
paid the ultimate price. A man called Ed Blecksmith's son, J.P., died 
over 2 years ago, 2/1/2/ years ago, on the famous November battle of 
Fallujah.



And repeatedly Mr. Blacksmith has said to me, ''You must complete 
this mission or my son, J.P., will have died in vain.''

So, Mr. Speaker, as we go into this Memorial Day weekend, I thank God 
that we are going to pass this measure that will be providing the 
essential support for our troops, so that General David Petraeus and 
the new leadership, with a new strategy to deal with uncertainty, will 
have the hope of victory. There is no guaranteed success, but there is 
a hope for victory because this is a struggle which is going to 
continue on and on and on as long as there are people out there who are 
going to try to do us in, to kill us, and to change our way of life.

So, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ''no'' vote on the previous question so 
that I can offer my amendment. And if by chance we are not successful 
on that, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule because of the 
unfair process that we have. But if in fact the rule does proceed, I 
urge everyone, in a bipartisan way, to support the very important 
measure that will allow us to support our troops and allow them to 
complete their mission.

Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.
