Mr. BOUSTANY. I think the gentleman is absolutely correct. And if you 
look at Iraq, there were 27 ethnic groups in Iraq, hundreds of tribes, 
and this was all held together artificially under Saddam Hussein's 
reign of terror, so to speak. And now that is gone and they are trying 
to figure out how to reconcile all of this.

And there are signs that there is Iraqi nationalism. Look at what 
happened recently with their soccer team, which was a phenomenal event 
where everyone was celebrating in the streets. It truly showed that 
they have that sense of nationalism and pride in their country.
