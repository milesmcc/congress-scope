Mr. HOYER. I thank the Republican whip for yielding.

On Monday, the House is not in session. On Tuesday, the House will 
meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business 
with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday, the 
House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.

We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The 
final list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of 
business tomorrow.

We will take any pending votes on H.R. 6063, the NASA Authorization 
Act of 2008, which we will debate later today after this colloquy; and 
we will consider H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave 
Act of 2008. We will also consider H.R. 5876, Stop Child Abuse in 
Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008; and we hope to consider and 
I expect to consider the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental appropriations 
bill.

I yield back.
