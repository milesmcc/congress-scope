Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator 
Craig to introduce legislation called the Security and Fuel Efficiency 
Act of 2007 or SAFE Energy Act. This legislation is a balanced plan 
with the overall goal to improve the energy security of the U.S. 
through a 50 percent reduction in the oil intensity of the economy by 
2030.

What that means, plainly, is that if we used more than 4 barrels of 
oil in 1973 for every one unit of GDP and are using just over 2 barrels 
of oil per unit of GDP today, then under the provisions of the SAFE 
Energy Act we are striving to get down to 1 barrel of oil per GDP by 
2030. This is important to me because the United States remains 
dangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil. Today we import over 
60 percent of our oil from Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other 
unstable regions of the world. This is very troubling to me.

In the United States, we use about 67 percent of our oil to power our 
vehicles. This is the area where we are least secure and increasingly 
dependent. I am proposing along with my colleague, Senator Craig, a 
bipartisan, balanced approach to securing our future energy through 
reducing our dependence on foreign oil.

Our proposal is grounded in four cornerstone principles. The first 
principle is achievable, stepped increases in fuel efficiency of the 
transportation fleet. The second principle promotes increased 
availability of alternative fuel sources and infrastructure. The third 
principle calls for expanded production and enhanced exploration of 
domestic and other secure oil and natural gas resources. Finally, the 
fourth principle improves the management of alliances to better secure 
global energy supplies.

Senator Craig and I came together on this legislation because we 
believe that bolder energy security measures must be taken now to 
address our long-term security, economic growth and environmental 
protection. Producing much of our energy at home will also address 
other major challenges.

There is no silver bullet to solving our energy dependence. Digging 
and drilling is a strategy I call yesterday forever. Conservation alone 
is not the answer. Renewable fuels hold promise, but we need to do much 
more here. We believe the combination of steps in the SAFE Energy Act 
sets the right pathway to U.S. energy security.

I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Security and Fuel 
Efficiency Energy Act of 2007 be printed in the Record.
