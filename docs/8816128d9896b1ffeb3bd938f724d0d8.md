Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Well, the point of Davis-Bacon, reclaiming my 
time, is to see that the workers, American workers, who build our VA 
hospitals, renovate our Department of Defense facilities, build new 
barracks and housing for our troops that are serving in Iraq and 
Afghanistan today, that they are paid a fair wage, a livable wage.

We can have honest differences on this. I tend to believe from my 
vantage point that providing that kind of honest wage brings in better 
workers and more quality work.



The gentleman might disagree with that, but we will agree to disagree 
on that.

The bottom line is I think the middle class is the strength of our 
Nation's economy, and the sooner we put dollars back into the pockets 
of those families willing to work hard for that living, the sooner we 
will get this economy off the wrong track and back on the right track.

For all of those reasons, I again oppose this amendment.

I yield back the balance of my time.
