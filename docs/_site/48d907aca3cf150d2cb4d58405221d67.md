`Mr. REID â€” 3 December 2009`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be 
in a period of debate only between now and 4:30. It is my understanding 
there has been an agreement that at 4:30 we will all go to the 
classified room in the Visitor Center to listen to what the 
administration has to say about Iraq and Afghanistan. I haven't had a 
chance to clear this with the Republican leader, but for the next hour 
we will remain in a period of debate only and come back and offer the 
amendment after we finish with the classified briefing.

We have not yet had agreement to recess at 4:30. I ask unanimous 
consent that we recess from 4:30 until 5:30 for a classified briefing.
