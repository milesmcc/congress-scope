Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. Let me underscore the 
point that, some 23 years ago, I was a new Member of this institution 
sitting in that last chair over in the corner, and I offered a pay-as-
you-go budget. I think I got 24 votes in 1983 or 1984. I have strong 
feelings about whether we will be accountable and whether we pay for 
what we want to do. My colleague from Oklahoma certainly raises a point 
I have raised for as long as I have been here and tried legislatively 
to insist upon some accountability in how we do things. With this 
program, obviously the problem we are in is by attaching these 
additional costs onto the premium cost today, we make it prohibitive 
for a lot of people. So we were faced with a choice which was not one I 
would have preferred. But we have ourselves in a position in this 
country today where we are spending almost that amount of money every 
month on the conflict in Iraq, and we are not paying for it, something 
Harry Truman would not have tolerated. In the war in Korea, he said we 
would go to Korea provided the American taxpayer was willing to pay for 
it.

Every 8 weeks we are accumulating a debt and passing it on to my 3-
year-old. The Senator knows I have young children. Every 8 weeks we are 
asking my daughter to assume the financial responsibility of this 
conflict. In addition to this program, we are trying to make a 
difference in people's lives, where they may lose their homes and their 
life's possessions. That is certainly one I would like to see us 
account for, but we are facing a situation today where I have to try 
and move this along. But I would hope that on a whole host of these 
issues, where we are talking about deficit financing or financing 
things without paying for them, that we would apply the same standards 
so we have this kind of uniformity to our concerns. And certainly, the 
$2 billion every week, the $12 billion every month, the $24 to $30 
billion every 2 months is another example of what happens when we ask 
the American taxpayer in the future to assume a responsibility. It is a 
legitimate point the Senator raises. I identify with it. In my tenure, 
I have tried to do something about it. Hopefully, we have done that, 
Senator Shelby and I.

I appreciate his kind comments about our effort in this bill to put 
this program on the kind of footing that never causes us to come back 
here again under similar circumstances and make a similar request for 
excusing a responsibility that FEMA had to borrow from the Federal 
Government to meet that $17 billion worth of obligations after the 
storms of 2005, which devastated a good part of the country.

At the appropriate time, we will have a vote on the Senator's motion. 
In the meantime, we have some other amendments that I think are coming. 
I know Senator Nelson and Senator DeMint and others have some 
amendments. I am happy to consider those as soon as they come over.
