`Mr. DURBIN â€” 18 May 2009`

---


Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, under the previous order, tomorrow there 
will be a rollcall vote shortly after we convene. The vote will be on 
the motion to invoke cloture on the Dodd-Shelby substitute amendment to 
H.R. 627, the credit card bill. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will 
dispose of the pending amendments and vote on passage of the bill, as 
amended. As a result, Senators should expect at least two rollcall 
votes tomorrow morning.

At 2:15 p.m., there will be a vote on confirmation of the Gensler 
nomination. We also expect to begin consideration of the Iraq and 
Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill sometime later tomorrow 
afternoon.
