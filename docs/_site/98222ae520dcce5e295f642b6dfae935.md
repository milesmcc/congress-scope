Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, when we bring an energy package 
the week before we leave for the July 4 recess that really begins to 
make sure that we end our addiction to foreign oil, they will know it 
was the Democrats. When we make sure we bring about an end to this war 
in Iraq, they will know it was the Democrats. And they will say 
repeatedly, ''they'' being the smart American citizens, American 
voters, they will say to our good friends on the other side of the 
aisle exactly what they said to them on November 7, after listening 
over and over to the same tired slogans, ''Talk to the hand. We don't 
want to hear it anymore. We see through your garbage. And we are voting 
to make sure we can move this country in a new direction.''
