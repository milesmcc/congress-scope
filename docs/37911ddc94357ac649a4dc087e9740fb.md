Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, today's headline in Guam reads, 
''Island in state of mourning.'' This is because Guam has lost its 10th 
son to the war in Iraq. The headline could read the same after 
yesterday's call for a recorded vote by the Republican leadership on 
H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Act, a bipartisan bill giving 
parity to Guam after 63 years of inequity and injustice.

The question we must ask ourselves before this vote today is, will we 
ignore history? Will we be deaf to the testimonials of Guam's 
liberators, our U.S. servicemen, who spoke about Guam's patriotism in 
the face of enemy occupation? Will we vote against inequity for people 
who aided our military to take Guam back from the enemy, who greeted 
our military with tattered rags made into American flags?

A vote against H.R. 1595 is one against patriotic Americans. I urge 
my colleagues to support the Guam World War II Loyalty Act.
