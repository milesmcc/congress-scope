Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Chairwoman, I would like to thank the chairman of 
the subcommittee and the ranking member for the great work they do for 
veterans and our military construction around the world.

I appreciate the opportunity today to rise to offer an amendment to 
the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that 
would increase funding for a program that provides free legal services 
to our veterans under the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims 
Account.

I am sure all of us as Members of Congress have talked to a veteran 
that has not received the benefits that they feel they are fairly 
entitled to. And if that happens, they can appeal the decision in the 
Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. However, as many veterans are on 
fixed incomes, they cannot afford the costly legal services associated 
with appealing a Department of Veterans Affairs decision.

The present law entitles certain veterans who wish to appeal to free 
legal services so that they can receive a fair hearing that they are 
entitled to without the burden of huge legal fees.

Veterans from throughout my district have expressed their concern 
that many veterans are struggling with the appeals process, and with so 
many of our warriors returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, we must take 
measures to ensure that all of our veterans' needs are provided for.

My amendment would increase the veterans' legal services account by 
$1 million, providing for more services for our brave veterans.

I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important amendment. 
I appreciate the opportunity to offer it.

I reserve my time.
