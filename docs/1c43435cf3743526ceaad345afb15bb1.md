Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, the motion to instruct conferees 
included language from the Senate stating that ''the Senate should not 
pass legislation that will undermine our military's ability to prevent 
a failed state in Iraq.'' I voted for the motion because the brave men 
and women of our military have done an outstanding job. They have 
served our country extremely well under difficult circumstances, and 
they have done everything that we have asked of them.

Preventing Iraq from becoming a failed state is not the job of the 
United States military; it is the job of the Iraqi Government and 
people. The Bush Administration assures us that Iraq is not a failed 
state, so our troops should be allowed to leave. We need to set a firm 
timeline for withdrawing from Iraq, so that Iraq's political leaders 
know that they will need to take responsibility for their own future.
