Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. And in this Month of the Military Child, we 
want to make sure that we highlight the impact on our military members' 
families, because they are the ones that end up forgotten.

And I thank all of you for coming this evening, because you all have 
some unique experience and involvement, unique constituencies who are 
significantly impacted by our troops' deployment in the wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan.

And someone who in particular has a specific family member who has 
inspired him is Congressman Jerry McNerney, who actually was inspired 
to run for Congress by his son, Michael, who in response to the attacks 
from September 11 sought and received a commission in the United States 
Air Force. And Michael suggested that his dad serve his country, too, 
by running for Congress. And when they pulled together as a family, 
Congressman McNerney decided that that was what he needed to do. And we 
were so pleased when your victory became clear on election night in 
2006, and it is with a deep sense of duty and your family's support 
that I know you are serving here and serving admirably.

So, the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).
