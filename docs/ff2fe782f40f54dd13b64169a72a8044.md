`Mr. KLINE of Minnesota â€” 5 December 2007`

Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and for 
his kind words.

I, like the gentleman from California, have a son serving in uniform 
and I am very proud of his service, proud of Mr. Hunter's son's service 
in the Marine Corps and my son's service in the Army in Iraq. I 
understand that on January 1 my son is heading to Afghanistan. So I do 
feel a certain personal importance to what we are discussing today and 
to the funding for our troops. But collectively we have all sent our 
sons and daughters into combat, into dangerous theaters in the world, 
and we need to make sure that we are giving them every chance for 
victory.

My good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey, said 
that we have learned some things not to do and some things to do. I 
would argue that the thing not to do is to take a strategy which is 
clearly working, which is bringing increased security to a dangerous 
spot in the world, to a strategy that is producing more electricity, 
more oil, opening schools, shops. You don't take that strategy and pull 
the rug out from under it.

Last July, Madam Speaker, I and other Members stood on this floor to 
ask our colleagues not to snatch the possibility of victory away from 
our soldiers and marines. In an atmosphere filled with overblown 
rhetoric predicting the failure of surge operations before they had 
begun in earnest, General Petraeus and those under his command pushed 
forward into the streets of Baghdad and into the tribal-dominated areas 
of al Anbar province. They engaged and destroyed al Qaeda cells while 
working closely with tribal leaders to establish a lasting stability in 
once hostile Sunni areas.

Just a few short months ago, critics in this body and the Senate 
declared defeat, declared defeat before giving success a chance. They 
did not believe our fighting men and women, implementing General 
Petraeus' new counterinsurgency strategy, could rout al Qaeda and 
insurgent forces and win over the Iraqi population. I am proud to say 
that they were wrong, and that is what has happened.

As we proceed with conference negotiations on this National Defense 
Authorization Act, I would urge my colleagues not to repeat the mistake 
we have sadly made many times before. We must not declare defeat while 
our military forces fight for victory. This motion to instruct 
conferees is just a small step to ensure that the position of this body 
is not to accept a strategy which will produce a failed state in Iraq.

In a letter to his troops before commencing the surge operations, 
General Petraeus noted that, ''Success will require discipline, 
fortitude and initiative, qualities that you have in abundance.''

The question before us today, Madam Speaker, is the same one I asked 
in July: Do we in Congress have those same qualities?
