Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, let this be the day that, respectful of 
the sacrifice of our men and women overseas, inspired and emboldened by 
the clarion call of the American people on November 7, 2006, and 
determined to show a decent respect for the opinions of thoughtful and 
caring people the world over, this Congress says to an administration 
that has been arrogant in its bearing and incompetent in its execution, 
no longer shall you turn a blind eye to the readiness of our troops. No 
longer shall you ignore the needs of our veterans. At long last, you 
are being called to account for a failed policy in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the supplemental 
appropriation bill, which marks the return of sanity and wisdom in the 
conduct of American foreign policy.
