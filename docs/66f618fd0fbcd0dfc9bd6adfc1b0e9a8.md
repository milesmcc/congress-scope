Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is an important amendment that 
appropriately recognizes the United States is now engaged in combat 
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan without a formal declaration of war. 
The amendment takes the appropriate step of modifying the statute of 
limitations to cases in which the use of force has been authorized 
without a formal declaration of war.

I very much welcome--and I am sure Senator Leahy does as well--the 
support of the Senator from Alabama. I do not know of anybody else who 
wants to speak on this amendment. Unless the Senator from Alabama does, 
I will suggest then that we move on to the next amendment.

I understand there is going to be a unanimous consent request that 
may interrupt that flow, but before we get to that, if the Senator from 
Alabama knows of no other--first of all, let me ask the Senator whether 
he does know of any other speaker on the amendment.
