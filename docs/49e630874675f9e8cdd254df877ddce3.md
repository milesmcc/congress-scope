Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I do not think the House should 
take up today the question of whether we will exercise our 
Constitutional authority to impeach the Vice President and to ask the 
Senate to try him on charges that, if proved, would result in his 
removal from office.

That does not mean I support the policies advocated by Vice President 
Cheney or that I think his official conduct has been above reproach. On 
the contrary, I think that he has helped create many of the most 
serious problems our country now faces and that he is continuing to 
advocate policies that would make those problems worse and bring 
further difficulties upon us.

With President Bush, the vice president spearheaded the unfortunately 
successful effort to persuade Congress to authorize a rush to war in 
Iraq--which I opposed. He also was among those in the Bush 
Administration who refused to listen to the many well-informed people 
who argued that it was imperative that adequate measures be taken to 
prevent the disintegration of Iraq's social and governmental fabric 
that otherwise predictably would follow the equally predictable 
successful military action to remove the Saddam Hussein regime. And now 
he clearly is among those who seem to prefer again rushing to use 
military force--this time to respond to the potential danger of a 
nuclear-armed Iran--before other options have been exhausted. I 
strongly oppose that, and have introduced legislation--H.R. 3119--to 
prohibit funds from being obligated or expended for military operations 
or activities within or above Iran's territory or within Iran's 
territorial waters except pursuant to a new, specific congressional 
authorization.



But the question now before the House is not whether we think the 
vice president's actions have been helpful to the national interest, as 
his supporters presumably would contend, or whether they have had or 
could have adverse consequences--as I myself think. Instead, we are 
being asked whether we should now, today, proceed to charge that the 
vice president has violated his constitutional oath to faithfully 
execute the duties of his office and to defend the Constitution and 
thus should be impeached.

The resolution sets forth what its author says are the specific 
statements and actions of the vice president that constitute violations 
of his oath. I agree that those statements and actions are deeply 
troubling and raise serious questions about the way the vice president 
has used his position, both in communicating with the American people 
and in participating in the shaping of Bush Administration policies. 
But at this moment I am not prepared to say that there are adequate 
grounds to conclude that those statements and actions in fact 
constitute grounds for impeachment--and I do not think that Members of 
the House should be called upon to reach that conclusion today.

I think that before the House is asked to reach that conclusion, the 
vice president should have an opportunity to respond to the 
resolution's charges and the statements and actions it cites in support 
of those charges. I also think that before we are asked to vote on the 
resolution, we should have the benefit of hearing from appropriate 
legal experts and other qualified witnesses and that the Judiciary 
Committee should prepare a report that will provide the basis for any 
debate here on the floor of the House.

Impeachment is not entirely a legal question. It is partly political, 
which is why the Constitution entrusts it to Congress and not the 
courts. But I think it is essential that any decision to impeach any 
federal official should come only through a careful, thorough process 
that provides adequate due process for the accused and that will lay 
the proper foundation for a sound decision. I think to do otherwise, as 
the author of this resolution seeks to do, would further weaken the 
civility toward our colleagues and respect for those with whom we 
disagree that should be the basis for our service in Congress and would 
only add to the polarization and rancor that are all too prevalent in 
the Nation's political debates.

For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I must oppose consideration of this 
resolution at this time.
