Mr. HODES. The bill honors our returning veterans by providing $2.1 
billion more for military health care than the President requested, 
including $900 million for post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic 
brain injury care and research, and $661 million to prevent health care 
fee increases for our troops. Because what they are now facing under 
this President's policies is getting sent off to war to fight for their 
country and coming home to find that their health insurance costs more, 
that the military health system is too overloaded to take care of them, 
and that the veterans' system has been overloaded beyond capacity.

Now, if the President vetoes these increases for the veterans and 
wounded warriors that his policies have created, it will be something 
that I don't understand and I don't think the American people are going 
to understand. And so he has a challenge in front of him. He has a 
challenge and a choice to make. And maybe between now and when this 
bill hits his desk, he will have one of those moments on the road to 
Damascus and decide that he will face the reality and do right by our 
troops, do right by the American people, do right by this country and 
set a new direction in Iraq.

I will kick it back to you, Mr. Murphy.
