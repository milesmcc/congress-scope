Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to say I am very disappointed in some 
of the provisions in this report. I must say that candidly. At the same 
time, I believe, very strongly, the reservations


I have pale in comparison with my disappointment in the failure of 
leadership that has brought us into Iraq in the first place--a 
leadership that refuses to find a suitable turning point which will 
bring us out.

This administration must be confronted. It must understand the 
American people have grown tired of this disastrous, one-dimensional 
approach to a crisis that demands innovative answers. It is for that 
reason I support this measure.
