`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 14 November 2007`

---


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It is not just the President. It is enough Members 
of Congress on the Republican side primarily that are standing by the 
President. They have to go to the voters next year and say, in my last 
term in Congress, I stood by President Bush. The thing is that when you 
talk about the war funding, the waste, the no-bid contracts, the 
Pentagon losing billions of dollars and nobody knows where it is, you 
don't hear our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, come up and 
pitch a fit about that. But if you want to talk about $1 billion or $2 
billion more in health, education, job retraining, all of a sudden the 
sky is falling. All of a sudden the party that raised the debt limit 
five times and borrowed $3 trillion under President Bush is now 
concerned with a shift in funding to college education, Mr. Meek, to 
community health clinics, Mr. Altmire, to Head Start, to these 
fundamental programs that this country has stood behind. And the kicker 
is SCHIP, $35 billion over 5 years, and the President says that's too 
much spending so we can't provide health care for 10 million kids, poor 
kids, but we can just turn


around without a blink of an eye and ask for $200 billion to keep the 
war going in Iraq, without any kind of deadlines or timelines or any 
kind of shift in the focus. That's the frustrating part.

Before I yield to my friend, I would just like to say there has been 
a pattern here. On September 11 or after September 11, Mr. Murphy, it 
was go shopping. And then during the whole SCHIP debate, it was, well, 
they can go to the emergency room, these kids. Then during Katrina it 
was, ''You're doing a good job, Brownie,'' consistently these flippant 
remarks that the President tends to make that lacks an understanding of 
the seriousness of some of these situations.

So it is frustrating as we are trying to make some investments into 
the United States of America, into this country, and the President 
consistently, with a small band of Republican supporters, is able to 
veto this, and unfortunately, we don't have enough votes in the House 
yet to override these vetoes.

I yield to my friend.
