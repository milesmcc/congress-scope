Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject 
the President's demand for war money and to instead support an 
amendment that will force the redeployment of our troops from Iraq and 
to fully fund the benefits that our veterans deserve.

A half decade after ''Mission Accomplished,'' the President is asking 
once again for $160 billion to fund a war that cannot be won 
militarily. But, Mr. Speaker, it's past time to look this President in 
the eye and say, ''Read my lips: No.''

Our military is superb, but it cannot impose peace in a country 
plagued by sectarian violence. Peace will not come to Iraq until Iraqis 
stop killing each other.

Nevertheless, the President's followers demand hundreds of billions 
more for combat operations while they insist on blocking a relatively 
small appropriation for our veterans. This is an outrage, and we owe 
our servicewomen and men the best. The years of neglecting their safety 
and well-being must come to an end.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting funds for 
war, in requiring withdrawal from Iraq, and in providing the education 
and health care benefits our veterans deserve.
