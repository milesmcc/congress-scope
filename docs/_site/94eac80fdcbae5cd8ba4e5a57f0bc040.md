`Mr. COURTNEY â€” 24 September 2008`

---


Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, let me take this opportunity to 
recognize the outstanding military service and contributions to our 
country of Commander Gerald Nereus Miranda, Jr., U.S. Navy--known to us 
all as Jerry--on the occasion of the completion of his assignment as 
Deputy Director of the Navy Congressional Liaison Office for the U.S. 
House of Representatives.

A native of San Diego, California, Commander Miranda is a 1990 
graduate of the University of California at San Diego. He received his 
commission at the Navy's Officer Candidate School at Newport, Rhode 
Island that November. After completing his initial submarine training, 
he earned his submarine ''gold dolphins'' in 1993. He served aboard USS 
Portsmouth (SSN 707), USS Florida (SSBN 728), and as Executive Officer 
aboard USS Key West (SSN 722). He also served with Joint Special 
Operations Command (JSOC) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and was a key 
member of a Joint Special Operations Task Force battle staff while 
stationed in Iraq, supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Following his Executive Officer tour, Commander Miranda was selected 
to serve as Deputy Director, Navy House Liaison in February 2006. In 
this highly visible tour, he assisted in the passage of vital Navy 
budget legislation during the 109th and 110th Congresses. Additionally, 
he planned, executed, and led 42 congressional and staff delegations 
across the globe that included meetings with various world leaders in 
support of America's national security policy.

Over the past two years, Commander Miranda has been a fixture in my 
office. His expansive knowledge of the Navy's policies and priorities, 
especially his experience in the submarine force, has helped me 
advocate for the needs of my constituents and my district. Whether it 
was answering questions from my staff about submarine policy, 
coordinating congressional delegation trips to Groton or simply taking 
the time to stop by the office to check in, Commander Miranda has 
always been a ready and accessible resource. His professionalism, 
resourcefulness and dedication to the Navy and our Nation has proved 
invaluable to me and my colleagues, and he has


truly set a high bar for those who follow in his position.

I am proud to say that Commander Miranda has become a valued friend 
to me and my staff, and we will miss having his counsel and support 
here in Congress. As Commander Miranda prepares to leave Capitol Hill 
to serve as a commanding officer of a United States Submarine, I ask 
all my colleagues to join me in thanking Commander Miranda and his 
family for their tireless contributions to a grateful nation and in 
wishing them the best in their future endeavors.
