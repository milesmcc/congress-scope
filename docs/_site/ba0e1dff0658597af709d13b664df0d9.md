`Mr. STEVENS â€” 17 February 2007`

Mr. STEVENS. ----and do not want us challenging them and trying to 
find some way to deviate money from their support or deny them the 
support they deserve. I would love to stand here and talk for hours and 
hours with my friend about how to support the troops. You don't do it 
by asking them to disobey the President of the United States. You don't 
do it by urging the Senate and the House not to support the President 
of the United States. You do it by trying to get together and working 
on a bipartisan basis to solve our problems.

None of us like war. I said the other day I hate war. I have been 
involved in the consideration of too many wars in my life, but clearly 
those people wearing our uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan need to know 
we support them 100 percent, and we don't stand here and talk about how 
we should find ways so they would not get their support, so we force 
the President of the United States to bring them home.

We will bring them home with the new commander there and the new plan 
we are going to put into effect, a plan that requires a surge for the 
safety of the people there, to move in the country to carry out the 
plan.

I support the President, and I urge the Senate to do the same.
