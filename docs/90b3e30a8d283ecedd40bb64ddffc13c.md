Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this important, bipartisan legislation--the Iran 
Counter-Proliferation Act of 2007--which has more than 300 cosponsors.

This bill would greatly strengthen the existing sanctions regime and 
propose new diplomatic strategies with respect to Iran, which continues 
to pursue its nuclear agenda in defiance of U.N. sanctions and 
international pressure.

Let us be clear: The Government of Iran--which is recognized as a 
state sponsor of terrorism by our State Department and which supports 
terrorist groups such as Hezbollah--believes it can exploit 
international irresolution. We must not allow it to do so.

It goes without saying that a nuclear-armed Iran constitutes a threat 
to the national security interests of the United States, as well as the 
peace and security of the international community. And, we cannot 
overlook the serious questions raised about Iran's efforts to exploit 
the civil war in Iraq to its advantage or intelligence information 
related to its arming of Iraqi insurgents.

Our concerns are only heightened by the inflammatory and 
irresponsible statements of Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who 
has stated his hope for a ''world without America'' and his desire ''to 
wipe Israel off the map.''

Let me say, Ahmadinejad's comments yesterday at Columbia University 
in New York only confirm the view that he is a dangerous menace, who 
spins loathsome propaganda while denying that the Holocaust occurred, 
threatening Israel, and repressing his own people.

I believe the international community must stand as one against Iran, 
an international lawbreaker whose record of deceit and belligerence 
leaves no doubt as to its motivations.

Thus, I believe this legislation is an important step forward in 
demonstrating our bipartisan resolve to address the serious security 
concerns posed by Iran.

Nothing in this act authorizes the use of force against Iran. 
However, it would support diplomatic and economic means to resolve the 
Iranian nuclear problem, and calls for enhanced U.N. Security Council 
efforts to respond to Iran's defiance.

Furthermore, the bill amends the Iran Sanctions Act to remove the 
President's waiver on sanctions, and expands the types of investments 
subject to sanctions. It reforms our commercial relationship with this 
rogue regime by limiting the export of U.S. items to Iran and by 
prohibiting all imports.

Among other things, the bill also prevents U.S. subsidiaries of 
foreign oil companies that invest in Iran's oil sector from receiving 
U.S. tax benefits for oil and gas exploration, and prevents nuclear 
cooperation between the United States and any country that provides 
nuclear assistance in Iran.

Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to support this important bipartisan bill.
