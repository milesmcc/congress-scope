Mr. REID. Mr. President, I cannot let the day go by without at least 
acknowledging a conversation I had yesterday afternoon with the father 
of another fallen soldier from Nevada. We lost two in 1 week. His boy 
just turned 19. I talked to his dad who was very sad.

I listened to the news this morning, and nine American soldiers were 
killed yesterday in Iraq. So we are going to continue doing what we can 
to have the President change course in Iraq. The present course is not 
working. We need a plan to bring our soldiers home.
