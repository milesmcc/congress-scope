Mr. FEINGOLD. Step 1 was our vote here in this body and in the House 
to say that the surge was unwise, and a majority did vote for that 
here, as well as in the House. This is step 2. This says that the 
fundamental underpinnings of this mistake should be reversed, that the 
resolution authorizing force in Iraq should be reversed. Yes, step 3, 
in my view, would be saying--to enforce it. Since the President won't 
listen to us, we need to turn to the ultimate power, the one the 
Senator from Kansas and I both agree is the appropriate power in this 
situation; that is, whether to use the power of the purse to remove 
funding.
