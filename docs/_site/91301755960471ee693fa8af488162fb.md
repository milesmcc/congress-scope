Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator and the Presiding Officer.

Maybe the next thing we can do as a Senate is take up the Senator 
from Colorado's legislation that I cosponsored, and a number of others 
have, on an honorable conclusion to the war in Iraq, and pass that. And 
then the American people might notice that with public transportation, 
with the Internet, and with the war in Iraq, the Congress was actually 
working together on issues that make a difference to them and is acting 
like grownups and achieving results.

This has been a good several months' work. I thank you for the 
privilege of working with you.

I yield the floor.
