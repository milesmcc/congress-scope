Mr. BISHOP of New York. I think it is, as I said before, a perfectly 
reasonable idea but also one that represents, I believe, an imperative. 
I think even the most ardent supporters of our presence in Iraq must 
recognize the enormous strain that a prolonged presence in Iraq has 
placed on our Armed Forces, and I believe the most ardent supporter 
must recognize that it will be enormously difficult, if not impossible, 
for us to maintain that presence at the current level or even at the 
presurge level. And thus if there is a chance of bringing order to 
Iraq, it must in the long term rest with Iraqi security forces as 
opposed to our own forces.

And as I say, we have spent $15 billion thus far, and I won't say we 
have little to show for it but we certainly don't have as much to show 
for it as I believe everyone in this Chamber would agree. So I think 
that of the shared principles, and I think they are all crucial and 
important, but I think this perhaps take prominence over all the others 
because if for no other reason, just the simple logistics of 
maintaining the troop presence we have given our current end strength 
is going to be enormously difficult, if not debilitating, on our Armed 
Forces.
