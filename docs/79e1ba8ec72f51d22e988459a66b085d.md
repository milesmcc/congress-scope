Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to a great 
American, who was recently honored by the Illinois Air National Guard.

Senior Airman Aaron Rath of Springfield, Illinois, has been chosen as 
the 183rd Fighter Wing's Airman of the Year. Airman Rath earned this 
honor after two tours of duty in Iraq in 2006 and 2007. He serves as a 
life member of the National Guard Association of Illinois, senior vice 
commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 755, a member of the 
Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, and 
vice president of the Defendors Association. Locally, he has been 
active in Big Brothers Big Sisters, and in the Law Enforcement Torch 
Run for Special Olympics.

Airman Rath enlisted in the Illinois Air National Guard at the age of 
29, after the September 11 terrorist attacks on our Nation. He told the 
local newspaper that he felt it was his ''utmost duty as an American to 
enlist and serve, and give a little back for what so many before me had 
sacrificed.''

I want to congratulate Senior Airman Aaron Rath on this much deserved 
recognition, and to thank him and so many other brave young Americans 
for their service to our Nation. It is through their dedication and 
their sacrifice that we are able to enjoy the liberties we all hold 
dear.
