`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 31 October 2007`

---


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. How about the President the other day? This drove 
me crazy. He says, Congress is wasting their time with all these 
hearings. It ceases to amaze me anymore that we try to pass children's 
health care, and the President says, well, they can go to the emergency 
room. We are trying to have oversight so that we can have real product 
safety, safeguards up for food, and you are having all these hearings. 
We are trying to oversee what's going on in Iraq so we can, A, fix the 
problems we are having, but, B, finding all of these billions of 
dollars that have been going to these nonbid contracts and the jobs are 
not actually getting done. Then he said, oh, you are having all these 
hearings.

Then he said today, about the SCHIP bill, I don't know if you heard 
this, but he said, Congress is trying to pass this health care bill for 
kids, but it's really a trick. He said it was a trick. This is not a 
trick. This is us trying to pass health care for kids. He thinks it is 
somehow cute to say that on Halloween that this is somehow a trick.
