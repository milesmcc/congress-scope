Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of my 
constituents, SGT John Hunsberger.

Sergeant Hunsberger recently returned from Haditha, Iraq, where he 
served a 7-month deployment. He was assigned to Company E of the Second 
Battalion, Third Marine Regiment of the United States Marine Corps.

The city of Haditha saw unprecedented improvements when Sergeant 
Hunsberger's Company E served. Upon arrival, Haditha was considered one 
of the most dangerous regions in Iraq. By the end of Sergeant 
Hunsberger's deployment, the police force was rapidly growing, attacks 
on Iraqi Police and Marine patrols were steadily decreasing, and 
relations with the Iraqi people were improving.

Sergeant Hunsberger earned the purple heart while in service in 
Haditha.

Madam Speaker, please join me in paying tribute to Sergeant 
Hunsberger, whose selfless actions benefit all Americans. Our Nation 
owes Sergeant Hunsberger and his fellow soldiers a great debt of 
gratitude for their service.
