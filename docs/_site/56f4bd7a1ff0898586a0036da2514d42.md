Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is no doubt that there may be things 
in the Defense budget that you could characterize expensive, 
overbudget, and behind schedule programs. But the C-17 aircraft is not 
one of them, which is why it is so bewildering--and disappointing--that 
some of this Chamber's well-known budget hawks are opposed to a model 
procurement program and a boon for the taxpayers.

While the most important concern, of course, is for our warfighter 
and national security--which I will go into in more detail in a 
moment--let me address what seems like the primary concern for some of 
my colleagues: the budget.

Investing in the C-17 is actually a better use of taxpayer dollars 
than the obsolete and unreliable C-5A. C-17s are planes we need and can 
afford. The Government Accountability Office has found it would take 
seven rehabbed and remanufactured C-5As, at a cost of $924 million to 
the taxpayer, to equal the capability of just one new C-17. They have 
to have that airlift. Right now, the C-5A is part of it. But it cannot 
continue as it is. You can get a C-17 for a lot less than you can 
remanufacture and rehab one of the old C-5As, and that doesn't even 
work so good.

My biggest concern, of course, is national security. Some of my 
colleagues have attacked the C-17 as a special interest item. I agree. 
Investing in the C-17 is in the special interest of our warfighters and 
it is critical to our national security interests and it gives us the 
heavy lift air mobility we require these days.

The C-17 is a proven, combat-tested airlift capability that is 
essential to the fight we are in right now, and it has been a workhorse 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

As some of my colleagues have mentioned, we are at war. I couldn't 
agree more that this is our primary concern, which is, again, why the 
C-17 is so important. With the war in Afghanistan heating up and the 
war in Iraq continuing, our airlift needs are only growing.

The Congressional Research Service has indicated that the C-17 was 
designed to fly 1,000 hours per year over 30 years. But as our overseas 
commitments have grown, some aircraft have even reached 2,400 flying 
hours in a single year. My colleague from Arizona pointed out that 
equipment is being worn out quickly in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is no 
doubt true. But one key piece of our equipment there is our heavy 
airlift capability. The heavy usage, in addition to the growth of the 
Army and Marine Corps, the logistics difficulty of getting supplies 
into Afghanistan, and the need for increased humanitarian/smart power 
missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the world are all 
reasons why I urge my Senate colleagues to support the provision in the 
bill that would add the long lead time purchase we need right now to 
make sure we can continue to purchase the C-17s as the needs develop.

Some opponents may argue that the Department of Defense and the 
President don't want more, that they have enough C-17s and C-5s to do 
the job. However, with a 50-percent readiness level, a per hour 
operating cost of $29,000, and 40 maintenance man-hours per 1 hour of 
flight, the C-5A represents ineffective and costly iron.

By replacing these obsolete, ineffective, and costly C-5As with new 
C-17s, which this Congress has allowed the Department of Defense to do 
by lifting a truly special legislative interest prohibition, saying in 
the past they could not retire them, we could save money, provide a 
more reliable capability for our warfighter, and preserve industrial 
capability for the future.


I have talked about the importance of investing in our airlift 
capability for our warfighter and our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
But as America's only large airlift production line, the C-17 
production line, if ended, would put at risk our Nation's long-term 
security. Eliminating the only large airlift production line in the 
United States would demonstrate a lack of understanding and 
appreciation for the skill sets and efforts needed to build these 
aircraft.

Without a follow-on program, and because we have already shrunk our 
aerospace defense industrial base to such a low level, once these 
skilled workers, the engineers, designers, and their expertise are 
gone, we do not get them back.

If we lose the skilled engineers, designers, and dedicated workers, 
we could be forced to turn to Europe or Russia for our future large 
airlift needs. More and more, this national talent and industrial 
workforce, which manufactures the critical and unique equipment that 
helps us fight and win our wars, is being eviscerated.

Without additional funding, our aerospace engineering, design, and 
manufacturing base will atrophy.

This will put at risk our competitiveness on the global market, our 
ability to address future airlift requirements, and put at risk 30,000 
American jobs stretched across 43 States.

This isn't about preserving jobs in tough economic times, although I 
believe the administration certainly missed a big opportunity in the 
stimulus bill to recommend stimulating the economy in defense 
production. They


didn't put a single dollar in defense production needs, which is where 
we have tremendous needs.

The C-17 addresses a shortsighted decision on the part of the 
administration. That decision took for granted the capacity and 
innovation of our defense industrial base, but we cannot afford to let 
that wither because their proposal put out of work the people who have 
designed these aircraft. We have found, in the past, when we have shut 
down acquisition lines, the skilled engineers leave. One example is 
they went to work at Disney. That is great. That is good work, but it 
is not protecting our national defense.

After the draconian defense cuts during the Clinton administration, 
the arsenal of democracy consolidated and shrank to a point where any 
further consolidation will result in an irreversible loss in 
competition, innovation, and industrial capacity.

C-17 production will shut down in 2010 without these 10 aircraft, and 
restarting production would be incredibly difficult and expensive--
according to the GAO, up to $1 billion.

The GAO study further noted that ''careful planning is needed to 
ensure the C-17 production line is not ended prematurely and later 
restarted at substantial cost.''

Additionally, the GAO found that ''both the manufacturer and Air 
Force agree that shutting down and restarting production would not be 
feasible or cost-effective.''

Keeping the C-17 line open is critical not only for our national 
defense but for thousands of American workers who rely on this aircraft 
for their livelihood.

With the waning demand for commercial aircraft and a lull in military 
fighter jet production, it is more critical than ever to maintain the 
aerospace industrial base that runs the only remaining wide-body 
assembly line in the United States.

I urge my colleagues to exercise their constitutional authority and 
not go along with what I believe will be shown very shortly, if we make 
the decision, to have been very shortsighted. This is a decision that 
we, in our constitutional responsibility, can and must make.

We cannot afford disastrous defense cuts coming out of the OMB, which 
is why we fought and won the effort in committee earlier. It is 
critical--and that colleagues join with me in supporting the managers 
on the floor to fight a shortsighted attempt to eviscerate our 
warfighter's airlift capability and our Nation's industrial base. Both 
are critical elements for the long-term security and future of our 
country.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the McCain amendment.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
