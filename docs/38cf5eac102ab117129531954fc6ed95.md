Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, Fort Campbell, one of the Army's 
largest posts and home to the 101st Airborne Division, is in the 
seventh district of Tennessee, which I am honored to represent.

Currently, over 700 Tennessee National Guardsmen and the bulk of the 
101st Airborne are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.

With this in mind, I'm particularly gratified that this House is 
finally discussing an appropriations bill today. Funding for Military 
Construction and Veterans Affairs certainly warrants our attention.

The brave members of our military, and the families that support them 
at home, are fulfilling the commitment they made to our Nation by 
fighting and serving to help protect it.

The federal government must in turn fulfill its commitment to provide 
top-quality equipment, facilities, and training for these heroes, and 
the best possible care upon their return.

On behalf of the men and women in uniform, veterans, and military 
families in Tennessee's 7th district, I urge my colleagues to support 
today's measure for MILCON-VA appropriations.
