`Mr. HILL â€” 28 June 2007`

Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, my hometown of Seymour, Indiana, has lost 
one of its finest. Although Carter A. Gamble, Jr. was born and raised 
in Georgia, he called Southern Indiana home for a short while. Carter 
Gamble was tragically killed in Iraq Sunday. My deepest condolences go 
to his family--his wife, Peggy, his children, including one on the way, 
his extended family, particularly Jackson County Sheriff Marc Lahrman 
and Carter's grandparents, Bob and Helen Lahrman. Carter served this 
country so notably and honorably. He was deployed to Iraq twice, the 
second time reenlisting in the Army knowing he would likely be sent to 
Iraq. I thank him for his unwavering commitment to our great Nation. I 
thank his family for loving and supporting him. Carter will be greatly 
missed and was taken much too soon from his young and growing family. 
Let us all keep Carter Gamble and his family in our constant thoughts 
and prayers.
