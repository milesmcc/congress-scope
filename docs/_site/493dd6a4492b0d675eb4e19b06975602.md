Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted to end debate on the House 
amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill because that 
amendment addresses important domestic priorities for Wisconsin and 
this country without adding a penny to the deficit. The amendment 
provides $10 billion to help school districts around the country facing 
funding shortfalls due to the ongoing recession, all of it paid for. It 
also provides almost $5 billion in fully offset funding to help ensure 
that the millions of low income students who receive Pell grants do not 
see reductions in their awards.

The House amendment also includes a provision to give public safety 
employees, like firefighters and police officers, collective bargaining 
rights. While Wisconsin and other States already protect public safety 
employees' collective bargaining rights, there are still several States 
that do not. Police officers, firefighters, and other public safety 
officers are on the front lines of protecting our communities and we 
should ensure that these hard working professionals have the ability to 
bargain for better wages and working conditions.

However, I continue to oppose funding for a massive, open-ended war 
in Afghanistan. This war funding will add tens of billions to our 
deficit without contributing to our national security.
