Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. You make a very good point, and I think it is 
tantamount and the American people have seen through and are seeing 
through the rhetoric of the Bush administration. They are not buying 
cut and run. The American people went to the polls in November and they 
did not go to the polls to cut and run. They went to the polls to 
change direction, a new direction.

There is no question about the fact that we have a vital interest in 
the Middle East. We know that for the foreseeable future, clearly 45 
percent of all of the known oil reserves would be under that region and 
certainly under Iran alone. All of the geologists have pointed out that 
25 percent is under that region. There is a great responsibility for us 
all there. Nobody is talking about cut and run.

We are talking about what is happening here is a civil war, and these 
Iraqis have got to fight that out for themselves, just as surely as it 
would not have been right for Germany or France to come and plop a 
hundred or 200,000 troops in the middle of our civil war. That had to 
be settled by us. They have got to settle their civil war. We have got 
to contain the situation, and that is how this new direction needs to 
evolve.

I yield back to the gentleman.
