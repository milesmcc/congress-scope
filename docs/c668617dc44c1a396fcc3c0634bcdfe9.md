`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 6 February 2007`

---


Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reclaiming my time, the other side 
just proposed an agreement that mandates 60 votes on two resolutions. 
Those are their words on paper. We agree to those terms, but at least 
we are suggesting that we be allowed to pick the proposal on our side, 
as Senator Gregg has just outlined what the proposal on our side would 
be.

The majority leader apparently seeks to dictate to us what the 
proposal on our side would be. That is simply unheard of in the Senate, 
that he is telling us that on the continuing resolution, we will get no 
amendments at all, and on the Iraq resolution, he will pick for us what 
our proposal is to be. I think that doesn't pass the fairness test.

I see the Senator from New Hampshire on the Senate floor. I wonder if 
he has any further observations he would like to make.
