# REPUBLICANS' ENERGY SOLUTION IS WORKING FOR BIG OIL BUT NOT FOR THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE

Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, when the President took office, gasoline 
cost less than $1.50 a gallon, and a barrel of oil was selling for $30. 
So they had a planning meeting down at the White House, and gas has 
jumped to $4.50 a gallon and oil is nearly $150 a barrel.

Despite these facts, the President would like the American people to 
believe that he has proposed a credible


new plan to lower energy prices, but consider this: The President's 
invasion of Iraq and tacit military threats to Iran have destabilized 
the Middle East and driven oil prices out of control.

Big Oil has leases, access, and decades to drill on millions of acres 
on the Continental Shelf, but they choose instead to drill down into 
the wallets of the American people. Oil companies are already exploring 
today. They're exploring the upper limits of their stock prices by 
using their billions in profits to buy back stock, not to reinvest in 
America.

We still don't know what the Vice President's secret meeting with the 
industry was when gas prices were $1.50 a gallon, but it sure looks 
like it's working for the oil companies, but it isn't working for us.

We've got a plan, and we will propose it and bring it out here on the 
floor.
