Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues and particularly the 
original cosponsor of this resolution, Mr. Hare of Illinois, in the 
consideration of H.R. 521, legislation naming a postal facility in Rock 
Island, Illinois, after former Member of Congress Lane Evans. This 
measure, sponsored by Mr. Hare, was unanimously supported by our 
committee and has the support and co-sponsorship of the entire Illinois 
delegation.

Mr. Evans proudly served our country as a Marine during the Vietnam 
War and was an outspoken voice for all veterans in the House of 
Representatives. During his 24-year political career, he sought aid for 
homeless vets, championed benefits for soldiers exposed to Agent 
Orange, and was an early critic of the Iraq War. He chaired the 
Vietnam-Era Veterans Caucus and was the ranking member of the Veterans 
Affairs Committee, where his service is fondly remembered.

Mr. Evans' ability to keep in close contact with his constituents 
made him an effective and compassionate legislator. He fought hard for 
working families and was a strong, progressive leader in the Congress. 
He continued his dedicated service while fighting Parkinson's disease 
for the past decade, and his presence is already very much missed in 
this Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Hare), cosponsor of the bill.
