Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution. One 
must put this debate in perspective. The administration certainly 
helped to create the war. Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, 
but Iraq did have one thing that is very valuable, and that is oil. The 
administration helped create the war. They created the Coalition 
Provisional Authority, and they helped to create the Maliki government. 
Now they are withholding information and classifying previously 
unclassified information. Again, no WMDs in Iraq, but oil.

I maintain that has all been about oil. The administration looks the 
other way on corruption, putting great pressure on the Maliki 
government at this very moment to privatize 20 to $30 trillion worth of 
Iraqi oil assets. Now, they can classify all they want over at the 
White House. But this is still about oil. It can't classify nearly 
3,800 deaths of our soldiers. They can't classify 1 million deaths of 
innocent Iraqis. They can't classify that the war will cost up to $2 
trillion. They can't classify that they are borrowing money from China 
to fight a war against Iraq. This war has been based on lies. We agree 
we should all abide by the rules of the House. We should also abide by 
the United States Constitution. That is why I support this bill. It is 
also why I support accountability, and I support impeachment.
