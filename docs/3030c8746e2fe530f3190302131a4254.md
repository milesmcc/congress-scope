Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the chairman and the ranking member.

Mr. Speaker, I am so honored that we have this legislation before us. 
H.R. 4918 honors a brave soldier, a brave marine, who gave his life for 
our country. And this legislation to name the Department of Veterans 
Affairs Medical Center located in my hometown of Miami, Florida, as the 
''Bruce W. Carter Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center'' is a 
great honor not just to the family and to the legacy that Bruce left, 
but also it honors the selfless sacrifice of all of our members and all 
of our veterans.

Bruce was born in New York, and he moved with his family to Texas, 
then Louisiana, and then they settled in South Florida. He attended 
Miami Springs Elementary School and then Miami Springs High School 
before enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps in Jacksonville, Florida. He 
was promoted to Private First Class January 1, 1969, and deployed to 
Vietnam in April of that year, serving as a radio operator with Hotel 
Company, 2nd battalion, 3rd Marines, 3rd Marine Division.

Sadly, his hopes, his dreams, his lifelong ambitions were brutally 
cut short in Vietnam. On August 7, 1969, in combat north of the 
Vandegrift base in the Quang Tri province, Private First Class Carter 
threw himself on an enemy grenade, giving his life in service to our 
country so that his fellow Marines could survive.

His sacrifice embodies the honor, the courage, and the commitment to 
freedom which is characteristic of both a hero and a United States 
Marine.

On September 19, 1971, at a ceremony attended by his mother, 
Georgianna ''Georgie'' Carter-Krell and other family members, Private 
First Class Carter was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his 
unwavering patriotism and sacrifice. For his valor Private First Class 
Carter has also received the Purple Heart, the Combat Action Ribbon, 
the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with one 
Bronze Star, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.

However, the legacy of Private First Class Bruce Carter's commitment 
to our Nation endures. It endures in his mother, Georgie, who has 
carried on her son's legacy through her leadership in an organization 
known as the Gold Star Mothers organization. Today Georgie is serving 
her second term as national president of Gold Star Mothers, an 
organization committed to paying tribute to the men and women who have 
made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of liberty.

I am privileged to represent the 18th Congressional District of 
Florida, hometown to many servicemen and women who have bravely 
defended our interests every day. My husband, Dexter, served our 
country in Vietnam as a U.S. Army ranger and was severely wounded in 
combat. My stepson Doug and his wife are captains in the U.S. Marine 
Corps, having served our country in Iraq. And I am deeply and 
personally interested in all of the affairs related to veterans to make 
sure that we honor them with the benefits that they so richly have 
earned through their sacrifice. They have served our country proudly, 
and they deserve to be treated with great respect.

Those who dedicated their lives to the service of others truly embody 
the heart and the spirit of all that is best in America. And that can 
truly be said of Private First Class Carter, of his dedication to 
freedom and of his fellow Marines, and it must never be lost in the 
dusty pages of our history book. Through the naming of this medical 
center, we will be remembering not just Bruce's sacrifice but the 
sacrifice and service of all of the brave men and women who proudly 
serve and wear our Nation's uniform.

I thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for this 
opportunity, and I especially want to thank the ranking member, my good 
friend from Indiana, for this time.
