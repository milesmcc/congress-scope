Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Richard ''Ric'' 
Hunsucker, a United States Marine Corps veteran, and the Walk Across 
America Team for their selfless efforts to bring awareness to disabled 
veterans across the country.

Mr. Hunsucker, an ironworker from Green Bay, Wisconsin, has completed 
a challenging yet worthy undertaking that has achieved great success--
all in the name of disabled veterans. On Veterans Day, November 11, 
2009, Mr. Hunsucker set out to begin his 202 day walk across America to 
raise donations and awareness for the struggles faced by disabled 
veterans.

Starting at the Duval County War Memorial in Jacksonville, Florida, 
Mr. Hunsucker and his support teammate, Jack Dixon, visited countless 
veterans medical centers and outpatient clinics to meet with disabled 
veterans, doctors, nurses, family members and the public.

This 2,600-mile journey took them through four time zones and eight 
states, ending proudly at the Balboa Park War Memorial in San Diego, 
California on Memorial Day, May 31, 2010. He carried a 5-foot by 3-foot 
navy blue Disabled American Veterans flag the entire route. All 
donations raised went to the Disabled American Veterans organization, a 
nonprofit that advocates and assists those injured while serving their 
country.

Mr. Hunsucker trained for six months for his 202-day walk and has 
since gone through three pairs of sneakers and countless aches and 
pains. Walking an average of 17 miles a day, meeting the families of 
those killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan were among the most 
memorable moments.

Mr. Hunsucker's patriotism and desire to raise awareness for veterans 
was best explained when he recently stated, ''You can build a memorial 
for those who have been killed, but how can you remember those who are 
disabled? You take care of them.''

Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my personal accolades to the 
Walk Across America Team for such a remarkable and dedicated journey.
