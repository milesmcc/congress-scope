Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we are about to 
begin the 2008 fiscal year without having enacted any of the 
appropriations bills for that year. I am even more disappointed that we 
are about to vote on a continuing resolution that provides tens of 
billions of dollars to continue the misguided war in Iraq but does not 
include any language to bring that war to a close. We need to keep the 
Federal Government operating and make sure our brave troops get all the 
equipment and supplies they need, but we should not be giving the 
President a blank check to continue a war that is hurting our national 
security. For that reason, I will be voting against this resolution.
