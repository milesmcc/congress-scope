## `f2e3e1d10f80e57f88b643d879693a41`
`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the House is considering 
today a dangerous resolution: the Afghanistan retreat. As a father of 
four sons in the military and as a former member of the 218th Brigade 
of the South Carolina National Guard, which served for a year in 
Afghanistan led by Major General Bob Livingston, I know we should trust 
our military leaders led by General David Petraeus and General Stanley 
McChrystal with


Major General Larry Nicholson of the Marines. These leaders will fight 
for victory to protect American families by defeating terrorists 
overseas.

Even liberal Newsweek highlights the success of the surge in the 
March 8 edition with the title, ''The Surge is Working'' with the 
subtitle, ''All Signs Point America's Way.''

Though the Taliban is entrenched in Helmand province, its grip is 
slipping in the rest of Afghanistan. These developments undercut the 
common belief that America is doomed to fail. In fact, Afghanistan's 
demography, sociology, military situation, and politics all favor 
Obama's counterinsurgency strategy. If the Taliban can't gain popular 
support or silence, it can't win.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
