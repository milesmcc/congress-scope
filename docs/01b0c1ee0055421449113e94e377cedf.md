`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 1 February 2007`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of 
a true American hero. Colonel Paul Kelly, of Stafford, Virginia, and a 
former member of the South Carolina Army National Guard, died in 
Baghdad when the Black Hawk helicopter he was in crashed.

Colonel Kelly served as a South Carolina guardsmen from April 1986 
until June 2001. During his tenure, he held key leadership and staff 
positions within the aviation program rising to the rank of Lieutenant 
Colonel. Colonel Kelly later transferred to the Virginia Army National 
Guard, with which he was serving at the time of his death. To date Col. 
Kelly is the most senior officer to die in the Iraqi theater of war. He 
was a mentor to many coming up through the ranks of military service.

Colonel Kelly would have celebrated his 46th birthday today. 
According to the Dayton Daily News, Colonel Kelly was nicknamed ''the 
Senator'' because he was always shaking soldier's hands, no matter 
their rank.

Colonel Kelly is survived by his loving wife Maria, his two sons, 
Paul and John, his parents, John and Mary Rose, and his five siblings. 
Colonel Kelly honorably served America and his family. My thoughts and 
prayers are with them all.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th.
