`Mr. MORAN of Virginia â€” 14 November 2007`

Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this is about whether or not we 
continue to fund the worst foreign policy fiasco in American history.

This is not about al Qaeda. In fact, if we had gone after al Qaeda 
when we had the opportunity, they wouldn't have been able to strengthen 
themselves in Pakistan and Afghanistan. But we've been diverted over to 
Iraq, where al Qaeda didn't even exist until our invasion gave them a 
recruitment tool and rallying cry.

And sure there's less violence in Baghdad, but the reason is because 
the Shiia have ethnically cleansed much of Baghdad. When we started, 60 
percent of Baghdad was Sunni. Now, almost 80 percent of Baghdad is 
Shiia.

And the reason there's less violence in al-Anbar province is because 
the Sunni warlords have taken it upon themselves to drive out the al 
Qaeda insurgents.

Our military generals have told us this war does not lend itself to a 
military victory. The most we can do is to step up our diplomatic 
efforts.

But the fact is that we are supporting a government that doesn't 
deserve our support. It is not representative of the people of Iraq. It 
is endemically corrupt. And the reality is that when we look back and 
ask ourselves what have we accomplished, we are going to look at a 
government which is far more loyal to Iran than it is to the United 
States. That's what we've done, to empower our enemies.

We've created chaos throughout the Middle East. And isn't it time now 
to have a plan to start withdrawing our troops, to tell our military 
families that they have sacrificed as much as we could possibly expect 
of them?

But the reality is that this policy has never been worthy of the 
sacrifice of our soldiers and their military families.



And if you really believed in what you're doing in this war, you 
would support Mr. Obey's attempt to pay for it. Not one dime of this 
war has been paid for. It's all been borrowed, borrowed from our 
children and our grandchildren. They deserve better and this bill is 
the best thing we can do for them right now.
