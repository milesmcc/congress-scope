Mr. KAGEN. Isn't that also one of the reasons why we were sent here 
to Washington to try to fix this situation where the 109th Congress 
failed to ask questions, failed to ask the pertinent questions, failed 
to hold hearings to find out what it is we are fighting for, why we 
really invaded Iraq, where's our money being spent? I've been told that 
20 percent of the money we spent in Iraq is simply unaccounted for. And 
20 percent of over a trillion dollars is a lot of billions of dollars. 
So I think the 110th Congress has a duty, a responsibility, and, yes, a 
constitutional responsibility to balance the balance of power, to reset 
the balance, and to also investigate wherever possible and ask 
questions.

So the questions I would pose to my Republican friends is, what is it 
you're afraid of? What is it that someone has done wrong? And whom is 
it we are trying to protect? Are we trying to protect America, or are 
we trying to protect special interests, either the telephone industry 
or the people that ask them to break the law in the White House?

Do you think it's possible that what they are really concerned about 
is their own immunity in the White House? Is that a possibility?
