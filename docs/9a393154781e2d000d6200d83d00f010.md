Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the stakes here are truly huge. We 
obviously share one goal; that is, to succeed in Afghanistan. What 
General McChrystal has pointed out repeatedly in his assessment is that 
the way to succeed is not just with resources. He says the crux of the 
matter is to get a new strategy. His words: get a new strategy.

The question is, are we going to allow this President the same 
opportunity to put a strategy in place or to change it, as President 
Bush did in Iraq, as we have afforded to other Presidents, including 
President Bush?

The right strategy here is key, as well as the resources. And to set 
an artificial date is a terrible precedent. To put a commander in the 
field at a public hearing to try to pressure a Commander in Chief to 
reach a certain result is unacceptable, inappropriate. The Secretary of 
Defense is not going to allow it, nor should he, and we are not going 
to ask it, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I hope the 
Senate does not ask for that to happen either. We did not do that to 
President Bush. We should not do that to President Obama.

I reserve the remainder of my time.
