Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I 
rise in opposition to House Concurrent Resolution 63, the resolution 
that calls on us to disapprove of the increase in troops in Iraq. I 
rise to oppose it, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to carefully reflect on what we are doing.

This debate may benefit the American people. This resolution will 
undoubtedly harm America and harm our troops. Every American wants our 
troops home. Every American wants this war over. But it is not that 
easy. You cannot just wish this war would end and believe it will go 
away as a problem for America. Life is never that easy.

Let us begin with the text of the resolution. Make no mistake about 
it, it is very brief, and all of us should have read it. It is two 
sentences long. It essentially says: stay the course. A resolution 
which says, we oppose increasing troops, but we support our current 
troops is a resolution that says, stay the course.

It is not a resolution that says withdraw. That might be a morally 
defensible position, because perhaps we should withdraw, at least some 
believe. It is not a resolution that says, put in more troops. It is a 
resolution that says, adding more troops is wrong, but we support those 
that are there.

That is a resolution to stay the course. I would suggest no American 
believes we should stay the course. I would suggest that the RAND study 
and the Army's manual on counterinsurgency both suggest that staying 
the course is wrong. Indeed, it is a recipe for failure. Both RAND and 
our own counterinsurgency manual say, if anything, we should have 
between 400,000 and 450,000 troops there.

So why would we support staying the course? Now, we all know that 
many of us, and I included, wanted a change in strategy in Iraq. My 
colleagues on the other side called for a change in strategy. This 
surge is the change in strategy.

Indeed, and I am mystified, and I am glad some of my colleagues today 
have made the point, this is the change in strategy, at least one of 
them, recommended by the Iraq Study Group. I thought my colleagues on 
the other side supported that. It seems to me that there is also an 
important flaw in this debate.

My colleagues say that this is a nonbinding resolution. I would 
suggest to you that when you are at war, and when the United States 
Congress acts with regard to that war, it is not nonbinding. The world 
is watching. The world is watching every word that is said on this 
floor.

I believe we have a moral duty to finish what we began. Earlier on 
the floor, my colleagues have mentioned that many leaders in the 
region, in the Middle East, have begged us not to leave. They have 
begged us to stay at least long enough to stand up the Iraqi Government 
so that it can defend itself. They have implored us not to leave.

Let me give you their words. They have said, because they opposed our 
originally going in, the coalition came uninvited, it should not leave 
uninvited. They are making the point that we have a duty to finish this 
effort. They have talked about analogies. They pointed out that a heart 
surgeon who begins a heart surgery is not entitled, halfway through the 
surgery, to say, you know what, I am tired, I want to leave.

On the other side of the aisle many of my colleagues have said this 
is hard. Indeed, it is hard. But that is not a justification for 
leaving. The best analogy I heard was one that said, this is like 
stepping on a land mine, where you put your foot on it, but you know 
that if


you lift your foot off it will blow up. We have put our foot on a land 
mine in Iraq. But if we lift our foot off before the Iraqi Government 
can defend itself, it will blow us up, and it will blow them up.

You cannot wish this war away. And so I would suggest this resolution 
is binding. The world is watching. Our allies, if we abandon Iraq, will 
never trust us again. But why do they want a nonbinding resolution? 
Because they do not want to accept responsibility.

The President does not have that choice. He has responsibility. Those 
who oppose this war have a duty to take a stand, one side or the other. 
If you oppose the war, then seek withdrawal. If you do not, then do not 
undermine our troops. Because make no mistake, this nonbinding 
resolution hurts our troops.

Let me just conclude with this point. In the midst of an ongoing war, 
it is impossible to support the troops and oppose the mission. Let me 
make that clear. The world is watching. Our enemies, al Qaeda, and the 
radical jihadists who hate us and want to kill us are watching. If we 
tell them we oppose the mission, we are encouraging them. They have 
guns, rockets, and missiles pointed at our troops. This resolution is a 
grave error. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
