# CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO  MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
## `ae3d09836a27c9cea23eb84bf7192ca0`
`Mr. McDERMOTT â€” 18 October 2007`

Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, this is the choice we have to make 
today. We stand up for our children and their future or we stand down 
with the President and tobacco companies. Good health or no health for 
millions of poor and disadvantaged children across America--that is 
what's at stake today.

The President will spend $50 billion in 5 months on a war in Iraq, 
but he won't spend $35 billion over 5 years on poor and vulnerable 
kids. We pay for SCRIP but we will keep paying for the war for decades 
to come. We take care of our children while the President passes his 
war costs on to our children, and grandchildren.

We can vote to provide access to quality, affordable health care for 
our Nation's children by voting to override this veto, or we can vote 
to sit back and watch the economic security of our working families 
erode day by day, as this Administration has done.

The President said he is using his veto pen on SCRIP to show he is 
relevant, but with the stroke of a pen he has merely shown he is 
irresponsible with the health and welfare of America's future.

Let's set a good example for our children and support a bipartisan, 
fiscally responsible, health care bill that will get us one step closer 
to universal coverage for all Americans.
