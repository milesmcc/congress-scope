`Mr. FORBES â€” 3 October 2007`

Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I would have responded to the gentleman 
from North Carolina had he yielded to me when he asked me the question 
what I would do that we support the intent of this bill, but it doesn't 
justify writing a poor bill. It doesn't justify taking away existing 
jurisdiction. When we have contractors that are committing bad actions, 
whether they are in Iraq or whether they are in Germany, we want to 
hold them accountable. Why in the world we would draft legislation 
which could reduce that jurisdiction is beyond me.

I would like, Madam Chairman, to yield at this time 7 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays).
