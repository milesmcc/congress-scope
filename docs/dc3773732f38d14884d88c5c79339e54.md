Mr. WHITFIELD. You know, every Member of this House has great respect 
for the chairman of the Armed Services Committee from Missouri and the 
ranking member from California. And like the American people, most 
Members of this House are torn in different directions on this issue of 
our involvement in Iraq and what steps we should take. But this 
resolution says as a requirement that the Secretary of Defense shall 
commence the reduction of the number of Armed Forces in Iraq no later 
than 120 days after the enactment of this act.

General Petraeus was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate, and in 
the supplemental, there was a requirement that, on September 15, 
General Petraeus would make a report to the Congress on the conditions 
in Iraq. And I believe that it is premature to come forth with this 
resolution today. But if it comes back at the end of September, after 
General Petraeus has made his report, the commanding general in Iraq 
with the responsibility, I think that all of us have the responsibility 
to read his report, to make an assessment which would be best for the 
American people.
