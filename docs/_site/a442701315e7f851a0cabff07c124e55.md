`Mr. LARSON of Connecticut â€” 1 August 2007`

---


Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud Mr. Stark, 
Mr. Rangel, Mr. Dingell, and Mr. Pallone for their outstanding 
leadership in bringing this bill before us today.

I turn to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and say to 
them, do not remain frozen in the ice of your own indifference towards 
the needs of children in this country.

It is imperative that we pass this bill. It is imperative not because 
of the statistics and the numbers, but because these are our children 
and our kids. That you find the time and the money to blindly put 
forward into reconstruction efforts in Iraq, but not the time, not the 
effort to make sure that kids in our own country receive the necessary 
funding that they need.

It is written that the difference between CHAMP and CHUMP is ''U.'' 
Do not become the vote that turns away the children in this country.
