Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, many of my colleagues here today would have 
you believe that the war in Iraq, our foremost front in the fight 
against radical Islam, is lost. They will tell you, Madam Speaker, that 
the causes for which we fight, causes upon which our own Nation was 
founded, like the freedom, the worth of the individual and human 
rights, are not worth fighting for in Iraq. They will tell you that 
game is over and that the best that the American people can do is turn 
around and walk away in defeat.

This defeat by retreat lacks wisdom of what war is about. America 
does not fight wars, so we can lose them by quitting.

This is the time for the United States to stand firm in its 
commitment to freedom abroad. Now is the time for the United States to 
build up this sprouting democracy, rather than let it be torn down by 
those who would seek to destroy all of us who believe in liberty.

Surrender has never been the American way, Madam Speaker. Since our 
Nation's inception, we have stood for what is right, even when all odds 
were against us. Let us follow in the footsteps of those who came 
before us, those who risked everything in order to preserve freedom for 
all.

And that's just the way it is.
