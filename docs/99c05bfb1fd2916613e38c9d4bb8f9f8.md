Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I simply want to take this time to thank the staff on both sides of 
the aisle. They worked overtime for many days and many nights, and I 
appreciate it very much, especially the committee staff director, Rob 
Nabors.

I would also simply say that we have heard twice now from the 
minority that this bill endorses failure. Not at all. What we have seen 
the last 4 years is a failure of intelligence. We have seen a failure 
of the administration to listen to career military. We have seen a 
failure to plan for the occupation of Iraq. We have seen a failure on 
the part of the administration to give the Congress accurate 
information. We have seen a failure to focus on al Qaeda and 
Afghanistan rather than being diverted to Iraq. We have seen a failure 
to understand the nature of the civil war in Iraq. And as a result, we 
have seen a tremendous collapse of American influence in the world. It 
is tragic.

I urge an ''aye'' vote for the resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Murtha.
