Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, last week, during my work period at home, 
my district office in Norwich was visited by a young Army enlisted man 
who had in one hand his orders for his fourth deployment over the last 
4 years. Over the last 4 years, he did two 1-year deployments in Iraq 
and one 7-month deployment in Afghanistan.

In his other hand he held a bag of medication, anti-anxiety 
medication, including Zoloft, because of the post-traumatic stress 
which we got actually diagnosed from a treating psychiatrist a few days 
later, which confirmed that his deployments have taken him to the 
breaking point. That is the dirty little secret about this surge 
policy, which is that we've broken the ground forces of this country.

This legislation crafted by Mr. Skelton, whose number one focus as 
chairman of the Armed Services Committee is always about raising and 
maintaining an armed force that can protect our national interest, is 
desperately needed, primarily for the people who have borne the 
disproportionate share of this war, which is the people who serve in 
our uniform and their families.

It is easy for us to talk about commitment in this chamber. It's time 
to stand up for the real people who are sacrificing for that 
commitment.
