`Mr. DURBIN â€” 3 October 2007`

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is a strange thing when the President 
of the United States uses his veto pen. He does it so rarely. He has 
only used it on two issues. Once, when we tried to change the policy on 
the war in Iraq and tried to bring our troops home in a responsible 
manner, the President vetoed it. The second was on stem cell research. 
When we tried to open up this opportunity for medical research to save 
lives and spare suffering for American families, the President vetoed 
it--not once but twice. Today, the President used his veto pen for the 
fourth time. Unlike other vetoes, there were no television cameras, no 
reporters, no announcements made. Quietly, in his office, the President 
signed the veto of the children's health insurance measure.

This children's health insurance measure is a program that has been 
in business for 10 years. It is a successful program, and it has strong 
bipartisan support in Congress. We started this program because 15 
million kids in America did not have health insurance. They were not 
the poorest kids. The poorest kids have coverage under Medicaid. They 
were not the fortunate children, those who were lucky enough to have 
health insurance through their parents. They were the ones caught in 
the middle, the kids of working parents who make such a low wage and 
have so few benefits they cannot provide health insurance for their 
kids.

So when President Bush vetoed this bill, why did he veto it? In a 
short, one-sentence statement he said: It was a middle-class 
entitlement.

I would say to the President: Isn't it about time someone stood up 
for the middle class in this country? To argue that a couple making 
$60,000 a year, without health insurance where they go to work, can 
spend $800 or $900 a month on health insurance and not feel that pain 
in their budget tells me the President or his advisers are out of touch 
with America.

When I go home to Illinois, and our colleagues go home to their 
States, the first thing you hear about is health insurance. You know 
what it is--people say: We don't have it where we work, and we cannot 
afford to buy it. We have health insurance, but it doesn't cover 
enough. Those are the realities of family life in America, and the 
President's veto today tells me he is out of touch with the real issues 
challenging middle-class working families in America.

Fortunately, we have put together a bipartisan bill. With the 
leadership of Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Orrin Hatch of Utah on 
the Republican side, Max Baucus on the Democrat side, and Senator 
Kennedy of Massachusetts, we have a compromise bipartisan bill. It is 
paid for. It does not add to the deficit. A tobacco tax on cigarettes 
and other tobacco products will pay for health insurance, so we will 
move from 6.6 million kids covered to 10 million kids, over 5 years, 
moving toward the goal of all children in America having health 
insurance.

The President's veto today tells me he doesn't share our goal that 
every American, every family, should have health insurance that they 
can count on and afford. It tells me the President is not in touch with 
the real life of middle-class working families struggling to make ends 
meet, struggling to pay for college, struggling to make sure their kids 
have health insurance.

This is an opportunity for Congress to come together, the House and 
the Senate on a bipartisan basis, to say to the President: Pay close 
attention to America. America needs a helping hand, and working-class, 
middle-class families need an opportunity for health insurance that 
they can afford for their children.

I urge my colleagues on both sides, let's continue this effort on 
behalf of these families to provide affordable health insurance for 
kids across our Nation.

I yield the floor.
