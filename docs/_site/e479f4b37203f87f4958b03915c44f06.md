`Mr. DURBIN â€” 10 July 2007`

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from 
Virginia first for offering this amendment. For those who are new to 
this debate, it is the first amendment on the Defense authorization 
bill, and it is about our troops' readiness to go to battle. There is 
no better author of this amendment than the Senator from Virginia, as 
one of only two combat veterans who is here, proud combat veterans, 
serving in the Senate.

I would like to ask the Senator, if I understand his amendment 
correctly, it says that if we are going to deploy American soldiers 
into fields of battle, in Iraq and Afghanistan or NATO missions, that 
they not be deployed any longer than they are given an equal amount of 
time for rest or dwell time, as they call it, for training and 
preparation for returning to battle. So if a soldier is being sent to 
Iraq for 15 months, then he or she should have at least 15 months back 
home at the end of that period--or reassigned to a peaceful setting--
before they can be deployed again, for Active-Duty soldiers. Is that 
the gist or substance when it comes to active duty?
