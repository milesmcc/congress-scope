Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, last November the American people 
demanded dramatic changes and provided a substantial Democratic 
majority. Since the election, President Bush has yet to show he got the 
message.

While an overwhelming majority of Americans are demanding that the 
Iraqi Government take more control, the President has, instead, 
proposed an escalation plan that flies in the face of military experts, 
the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, Democrat and Republican leaders in 
Congress and the American public.

While the President continues his failure to listen when it comes to 
Iraq, I hope tonight he will actually propose some helpful solutions to 
some of the most pressing concerns of hardworking middle-class 
Americans like those I represent in the State of Missouri.

This Democratic House has already produced positive results for the 
American people, passing our promised 100-hour agenda. I hope the 
President embraces these policies tonight and shows the American people 
that he has heard their discontent and plans to work with the 
Democratic Congress that the American people chose to take us in a new 
direction.
