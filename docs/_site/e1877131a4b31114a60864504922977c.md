Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our 
most dedicated Air Force noncommissioned officers, Chief Master 
Sergeant Todd Small on the occasion of his departure from Shaw Air 
Force Base, South Carolina, as the Command Chief, Ninth Air Force and 
United States Central Command Air Forces.

In these capacities, Chief Small was the senior enlisted man charged 
with facilitating the development, training, and readiness of over 
50,000 airmen within the Ninth Air Force and the United States Central 
Commands' areas of operations. Chief Small was a front-line leader, who 
traversed more than 5,400 miles, across 11 countries, to enhance the 
mission of the airmen deployed in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom 
and Enduring Freedom.

Chief Small has truly answered the call of duty to his country and 
his community. I join the men and women of Shaw Air Force Base in 
honoring Chief Small, his wife Frankie, and their children Chelsea and 
Aaron, for their dedication and commitment to the Air Force, and I wish 
Chief Small the best in his new position as the Command Chief to the 
United States Space Command.
