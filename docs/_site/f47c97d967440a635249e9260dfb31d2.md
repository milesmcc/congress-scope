Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

The great Chinese strategist and thinker once wrote that war should 
not be begun unless the end is in sight. Sadly, that admonition of Sun 
Tzu was not adhered to in this war in Iraq.

Let me bring us back to what we are all about today. We have been 
hearing discussions ranging from both ends of the football field. This 
is a very simple, straightforward resolution.

The first part of it is: We fully support the American troops. And I 
am going to say, Madam Speaker, we are so proud of them. They are 
volunteers, they are professionals, they understand the word duty.

And, secondly: We do not agree with the troop increase of 21,500, for 
the simple reason it has not worked in the past, for the simple reason 
it is going to cause somewhere between 2,500 and 13,000 support troops 
to support that effort. And, consequently, it is not a well-thought-out 
tactic. And despite the fact that some wish to call it a strategy, it 
is a tactic, and there is a large difference between the two.

Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to a member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee as well as the Budget Committee, the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).
