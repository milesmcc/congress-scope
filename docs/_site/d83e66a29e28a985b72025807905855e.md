Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi. The 
gentleman is right, I was having a little trouble finding that poster 
because I don't have that poster; but I do have a smaller copy of it. I 
guess you would call this a slide, Mr. Speaker.

But I did want to read this quote from the testimony of Ambassador 
Crocker before I call on my colleague, Colonel John Kline. Here is what 
Ambassador Crocker said: ''A secure, stable democratic Iraq at peace 
with its neighbors is attainable. In my judgment, the cumulative 
trajectory of political, economic and diplomatic developments in Iraq 
is upwards, although the slope of that line is not steep. The process 
will not be quick. It will be uneven, punctuated by setbacks as well as 
achievements, and it will require substantial United States resolve and 
commitment.''

I think the ambassador and General Petraeus served this country 
extremely well today in their testimony, and their facts were accurate.

Mr. Speaker, with that I want to yield to my colleague on the House 
Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline).
