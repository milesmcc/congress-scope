`Mr. SHUSTER â€” 19 March 2007`

---


Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I wanted to talk a 
little bit more about the politics of this. And, again, I want to read 
something that The Washington Post wrote on March 13. I took bits and 
pieces out of there, but I think it is pretty consistent throughout the 
whole editorial. And again to remind my colleagues if they have 
forgotten, The Washington Post is no friend of the Bush administration, 
and it is no supporter of Republican causes. But I will give The 
Washington Post credit that it takes a position, thinks about it, and 
comes down many times on the different side of the issue, or at least 
they are thoughtful about it.

And this Washington Post editorial, ''The Pelosi Plan for Iraq, it 
makes perfect sense if the goal is winning votes in the United States.

''The only constituency House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi ignored in her 
plan for amending President Bush's supplemental war funding bill are 
the people of the country that the U.S. troops are fighting to 
stabilize. The Democratic proposal doesn't attempt to answer the 
question of why August 2008 is the right moment for the Iraqi 
Government to lose all support from U.S. combat units. It doesn't hint 
at what might happen if American forces were to leave at the end of 
this year, a development that would be triggered by the Iraqi 
Government's weakness. It doesn't explain how continued U.S. interests 
in Iraq, which holds the world's second largest oil reserves and a 
substantial cadre of al Qaeda militants, would be protected after 2008. 
In fact,'' The Washington Post says, ''it may prohibit U.S. forces from 
returning once they leave.

''In short, the Democratic proposal . . . is an attempt to impose 
detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself.

''Will Iraq collapse into unrestrained civil conflict with 'massive 
civilian casualties,' as the U.S. intelligence community predicts in 
the event of a rapid withdrawal? Will al Qaeda establish a powerful new 
base for launching attacks on the United States and its allies? Will 
there be regional war that sucks in Iraq's neighbors such as Saudi 
Arabia and Turkey? The House legislation is indifferent. Whether or not 
any those events happened, U.S. forces would be gone.

''Ms. Pelosi's strategy leads not toward a responsible withdrawal 
from Iraq but to a constitutional power struggle with Mr. Bush, who has 
already said he will veto the legislation. Such a struggle would serve 
the interests of neither the Democrats nor the country.''

And, again, that is coming from The Washington Post. So don't listen 
to a Republican Member of Congress from Pennsylvania, a conservative 
Republican from Pennsylvania. Listen to what The Washington Post has to 
say. And they are pointing it out over and over again: this is a bad 
plan; this is a bad war supplemental. And, again, I believe that it 
uses our men and women in harm's way as bargaining chips and it makes 
it more dangerous for those men and women in Iraq.

And it also is going to destroy their morale. If they find out they 
are going to be pulled out in 2 months or 6 months or 18 months or 
whatever the Democratic proposal is, which we are not quite sure, what 
is going to give a young marine or ranger the will to go kick in a door 
where the bad guys are when he sits back in his quarters and says, 
Well, I could be out of this place in 3 months or 6 months. I mean, it 
is going to destroy the morale of our men and women.

I yield to the gentleman.
