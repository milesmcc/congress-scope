Mr. BISHOP of New York. I just want to make two points. One, on the 
question of engaging Iran and others that we see as enemies or 
adversaries, you are quite right, Mr. Dent, that there is no guarantee 
of success if we do engage, but we can virtually guarantee no success 
if we don't engage. So it just seems to me that engagement is 
absolutely crucial.

I think I am quoting former Secretary of State Baker correctly when I 
quote him as saying that engaging in dialogue with our enemies is not 
appeasement. It is diplomacy and negotiation and dialogue, something I 
think we have had too little of. Hopefully we are moving in that 
direction now, and signs recently are that we are.

The second point I would make is that Iran has an awful lot at stake 
here. If, in fact, as a great many fear, Iraq becomes a haven for al 
Qaeda, I cannot imagine that Iran views an al Qaeda-Sunni dominated 
state on their borders as something that is in their best interests. So 
I think that they clearly do have in effect common interests with us in 
terms of bringing some order, some stability, to Iraq.
