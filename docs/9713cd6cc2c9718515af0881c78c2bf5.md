Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to recent reports 
that the United States commanders in Iraq are rejecting the 
recommendations from Army mental health experts.

To address the rising number of returning war heroes with mental 
health problems, Army psychologists have said that troops need a 1-
month reprieve for every 3 months in combat, a suggestion that's been 
brushed aside by these commanders.

Denying troops the rest they need is another irresponsible move in a 
long line of policies that show a complete disregard for the well-being 
of our troops, such as being sent to war without adequate armor, being 
forced to complete multiple deployments, and when wounded, being 
subjected to a bureaucratic mess such as Walter Reed.

Mr. Speaker, I've only been in Congress since January, yet, this 
week, I made my sixth call to the spouse of a wounded or killed soldier 
in this war.

I'm tired of this war. My constituents are tired of this war. The 
American people are tired of this war. It's time to put the health and 
well-being of our troops first. It's time to bring them home.
