Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I see our colleague, Senator Lieberman, is 
on the floor. If I may, I wish to direct a question his way.

One of the themes of the testimony from General Petraeus is that 
after the surge has progressed to this stage, the biggest threat to 
Iraqi stability is no longer al-Qaida or sectarian violence but special 
groups trained by the Iranian Government sent back into Iraq to 
destabilize this effort of moderation.



Mr. President, can Senator Lieberman tell us his take on Iran's 
involvement and where he thinks we need to go as a nation?
