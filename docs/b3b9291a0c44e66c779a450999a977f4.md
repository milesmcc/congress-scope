Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the McGovern-Lewis 
amendment.

This important amendment will prohibit funding to the infamous 
Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) 
formerly known as the School of the Americas.

We all know the history of this Institute that has long been 
associated with human rights abuses and many of its students have been 
tied to death squads and international coups.

Despite assurances to the contrary by supporters of the WHINSEC, the 
continuing legacy of blood and terror by these graduates calls into 
question how these candidates are recruited and vetted.

Mr. Chairman, at a time when our occupation of Iraq has greatly 
damaged our credibility and standing in the world, the last thing we 
need to be doing is funding an organization like WHINSEC that is 
drenched in a legacy of secrecy, terror, and violence.

I urge my colleagues to support the McGovern-Lewis amendment.
