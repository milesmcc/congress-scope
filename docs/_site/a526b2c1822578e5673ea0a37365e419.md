Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise again today to once again bring a 
sense of reality and clear light to the immigrant and Latino 
communities of our Nation.

Six months ago, my family and I went to the wake of a 19-year-old 
soldier who died in Iraq from my hometown of Tucson, Arizona. It was 
very difficult, especially when his mother asked me to tell her why he 
died. I should say, she spoke only Spanish. I said what I could about 
freedom, sacrifice, and liberty. And now, this Congress wants to change 
legislation to have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission not 
investigate or prosecute cases of discrimination if the complainant 
doesn't speak English, like this young man's mother. She gave this 
Nation a son.

I challenge, no, I demand of those proponents that want to have 
second-class citizenship in this country to go to that mother and tell 
her why.
