Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Yesterday, the President of the United 
States went to South Carolina to address the United States military to 
convince them that the al Qaeda network in Iraq is part of the 
international network of al Qaeda. But as I rise to support the 
legislation that will appear on the floor today, No Permanent Bases in 
Iraq, I rise vigorously to support this important legislation, that I 
have co-sponsored.

The National Intelligence Estimate has been very clear, and that is 
that al Qaeda has become stronger because of our military presence in 
Iraq. It's time now to make the statement and the decision, no 
permanent military bases of the United States in Iraq.

Four thousand lives, almost, of our soldiers have been lost. They are 
our heroes. We claim they are our heroes. They've done their job. It is 
time now, Mr. President, to redeploy our soldiers in a safe manner and 
recognize the misdirected war in Iraq, political reconciliation is the 
answer.

It is time now for the Iraqis and the Prime Minister to stand up, 
along with the sister states in the region, and establish the 
reconciliation goverment for Iraq. Please support No Permanent Bases in 
Iraq.
