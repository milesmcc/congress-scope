Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Speaker, what we have today is another Pelosi plan for America.

But let's remember the Pelosi plan for jobs: an $800 billion stimulus 
plan that caused unemployment to go from 8.5 percent to over 10 
percent.

Let's remember the Pelosi plan for automobiles: Cash for Clunkers, a 
$3 billion program that even the Democrats agreed did not work and was 
killed after 3 weeks.

The Pelosi plan for fiscal discipline: a $1.4 trillion debt this 
year, the highest in history.

And let's don't forget the Pelosi plan for national security: 
dithering in Afghanistan.

Now we have the Pelosi plan for health care: it kills small 
businesses and jobs. It raises taxes. It raises premiums. It cuts 
Medicare. It takes away your current health care coverage and spends $1 
trillion.

Vote ''no'' on the Pelosi plan for a government takeover of health 
care and join the bipartisan Members of this Congress who plan to 
promote an alternative which is far better.
