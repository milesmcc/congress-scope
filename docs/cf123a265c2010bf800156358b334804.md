Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3162, the 
Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. This bill invests $50 
billion in our children and our seniors. The minority has had no 
objections to spending half a trillion dollars in Iraq but objects to 
$50 billion over 5 years for our children and seniors. Where are their 
priorities?

Passing this bill will mean that 5 million more children who are 
already eligible for SCHIP will be enrolled. That will bring the total 
number of children covered by SCHIP to 11 million. Passing this bill 
will mean a real investment for our children, our seniors, and, indeed, 
our Nation.

I urge ''yes'' vote on the CHAMP Act.
