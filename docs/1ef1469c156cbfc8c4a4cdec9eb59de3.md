Mr. HOYER. Well, we're coming back Monday. There will be votes at 
6:30. There'll be suspensions. On Monday the House will meet at 10:30 
a.m. for morning-hour business and noon for legislative business. We'll 
consider several bills under suspension of the rule as is usual. Notice 
of those bills will be given by the end of the week.

On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning hour business, 
10 a.m. for legislative business. We'll consider additional bills under 
suspension of the rules. A complete list, as I said, will be announced 
by the close of business tomorrow. On Wednesday and Thursday the House 
will meet at 10 a.m. We expect to consider H.R. 1100, the Carl Sandburg 
Home National Historic Site Boundary Provision, and H.R. 2316, Honest 
Leadership and Open Government Act, and the conference report on the 
supplemental appropriations to fund Iraq, Katrina, veterans health and 
other matters.
