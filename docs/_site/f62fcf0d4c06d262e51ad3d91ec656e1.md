Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to yield such time as he 
may consume to my distinguished colleague from Texas, a member of our 
Foreign Affairs Committee, Judge Poe, who is very cognizant of Public 
Law 109-364, which already says that they will have no permanent 
military bases in Iraq.
