Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule. 
Yesterday the Culberson-Reichert-Shays Iraqi reconstruction amendment 
was offered and subsequently ruled out of order before the Rules 
Committee.

The intent of this amendment was to allow for the recent gains in 
Iraq to continue and at the same time reduce the burden on American 
taxpayers. Since April 2003, United States taxpayers have spent more 
than $46 billion in reconstruction in Iraq.

This amendment would have allowed us to begin to reduce American 
taxpayer dollars going to Iraq for reconstruction. This amendment would 
have directed that U.S. taxpayer dollars going to Iraq, to come to Iraq 
in the form of a loan. It would have enabled the Iraqis to still have a 
steady flow of reconstruction funding should they be unable to draw 
down their own funds.

Now is the time, especially with skyrocketing oil prices, for the 
Iraqis to stand up and take responsibility for their own 
reconstruction. In order for the Iraqi Government to stand up their 
economy, they must take the responsibility, they must bear the costs 
for reconstruction of their own country, not the American taxpayer. I 
oppose this rule.
