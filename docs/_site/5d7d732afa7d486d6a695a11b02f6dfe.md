Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today the residents of northwest 
Georgia are saying good-bye to a native son who died while bravely 
serving his Nation in Afghanistan. Specialist Ryan Charles King was 
killed in action on May 1, 2009, in Afghanistan when his unit came 
under enemy fire while on a night mission.

Last evening, Mr. Speaker, I joined Specialist King's family, his 
friends and supporters at his visitation to honor the life of this 
brave soldier. In speaking with Specialist King's parents, I found out 
that he and I have a history together. When I was an obstetrician-
gynecologist, I delivered Ryan King a little over 22 years ago on 
Veteran's Day in 1986. How fitting that this brave soldier who made the 
ultimate sacrifice for his country was born on such a special day.

We remember Ryan as a man of the highest character whose receipt of 
the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Good 
Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and NATO 
Medal are testament to the supreme sense of duty he felt to his country 
and to his comrades.

Born in Marietta, Georgia, at WellStar Kennestone Hospital, Ryan 
attended Faith Lutheran Church for many years.



He was a talented and a spirited baseball player, leaving his mark on 
the diamonds throughout Canton, Powder Springs, and Dallas, Georgia.

A few months after graduating from East Paulding County High School, 
Ryan King fulfilled a lifelong dream and he enlisted in the United 
States Army. He went to basic training at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, 
followed by advanced individual training at Fort Huachuca in Arizona. 
After completing his training, Specialist King was stationed in Korea 
for 1 year, and it was there that he met his wife, Sergeant Rachel 
Nicole Smith King.

As a member of the Special Troops Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st 
Infantry, he left for deployment in eastern Afghanistan in July of 2008 
and, sadly, was scheduled to return to Fort Hood in Texas in June, 
2009, just 1 month from now.

Specialist King leaves behind his wife, Sergeant King, his father, 
Charles King of Temple, Georgia, his mom, Candice R. King of Decatur, 
Georgia, younger brothers Tyler King of Temple and Dante Moore of 
Decatur, grandparents, Dorothea King of Temple and Tommy and Nancy 
Roberts of Dallas, Georgia, as well as many aunts, uncles and cousins.

Mr. Speaker, my prayers go out to his family. And my deepest 
gratitude goes out to Specialist King for his selfless sacrifice for 
our Nation. I ask all Members to join me in honoring the distinguished 
memory of Specialist Ryan Charles King.
