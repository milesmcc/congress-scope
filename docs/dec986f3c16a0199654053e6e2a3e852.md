Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

As author of H.R. 692, the Army Specialist Joseph P. Micks Federal 
Flag Code Amendment Act of 2007, I urge my colleagues to support its 
passage.

Madam Speaker, those who make the ultimate sacrifice for our country 
deserve our country's utmost respect. H.R. 692 will ensure that our 
fallen troops and their families are provided the appropriate respect 
due.

The Army Specialist Joseph P. Micks Federal Flag Code Amendment Act 
of 2007 would require all Federal Government agencies in a State to 
comply with a Governor's proclamation to fly the national flag at half-
staff in honor of those who lose their lives serving our country.

H.R. 692 is named after Joseph P. Micks, a soldier from Rapid River, 
Michigan, who was killed in Iraq last July at the age of 22. Specialist 
Micks was an all-American soldier and citizen. He was an altar server 
at church, an Eagle Scout from Troop 466 in Gladstone, Michigan, loved 
to collect sports memorabilia, and fixed the computers of his 
neighbors. He joined the Army to help others, to make a difference.

His death was not only mourned by his family and friends, but also by 
the citizens of the rural communities which make up and comprise Delta 
County, Michigan. As his funeral procession progressed through several 
rural communities in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, citizens were 
upset to note that some Federal agencies had not lowered their flags 
based on the Governor's proclamation in honor of Specialist Micks.

There have been several other instances in my district, 
unfortunately, when a Federal agency has not lowered its flag in 
accordance with Governor Granholm's proclamation.

When I have learned of Federal agencies, offices and buildings that 
have not lowered their American flags, I have contacted the agencies. I 
have been told that the directive to lower the flag has not come from 
the district office or the regional office or from Washington 
headquarters. It is regrettable that this legislation is even 
necessary. Last year I wrote the President asking him to issue an 
executive order to have the flags lowered. He has not responded. 
However, as there have been not one but multiple instances where 
Federal agencies have ignored the Governor's request to lower flags, it 
is important that Congress address this issue.



In a recent example, when Navy SEAL Joe Schwedler was killed recently 
in Iraq, it was the Veterans Affairs hospital that refused to lower its 
flag. Veterans presented officials with the article from the local 
newspaper, the Daily News from Iron Mountain. It says: ''Flags Lowered 
for Crystal Falls Hero,'' and still the Veterans Administration refused 
to lower the flag.

I include this article for the Record.









 [From the Daily News, April 12, 2007]










Flags Lowered for Crystal Falls Hero














Half-staff on Friday




 Lansing.--Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm has ordered United 


 States flags throughout Michigan and on Michigan waters 


 lowered for one day on Friday, April 13, in honor of Navy 


 Petty Officer 2nd Class Joseph C. Schwedler of Crystal Falls 


 who died April 6 while on active duty in Iraq.



 Flags should return to full staff on Saturday, April 14.



 Schwedler, 27, died from enemy action while conducting 


 combat operations in Al Anbar province, Iraq. He was assigned 


 to the East Coast Navy SEAL Team.



 When flown at half-staff or half-mast, the United States 


 flag should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and 


 then lowered to the half-staff or half-mast position. The 


 flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered 


 for the day.



 A military funeral will be conducted at 1 p.m. Saturday, 


 April 14, at the Forest Park High School gymnasium in Crystal 


 Falls.



 A scholarship fund will be established with the Crystal 


 Falls Area Community Fund, Post Office Box 269, Crystal 


 Falls, Michigan 49920.



 The Jacobs-Plowe Funeral Home, Crystal Falls is in charge 


 of arrangements.


The inconsistent patchwork display of respect is particularly hurtful 
to rural communities where the funeral processions of fallen troops 
often travel by several Federal facilities, some with flags lowered, 
others without.

Rural Americans disproportionately fill the ranks of our armed 
services and have disproportionately paid the ultimate sacrifice. 
Almost half of U.S. military casualties have hailed from towns fewer 
than 25,000 people; one in five from towns smaller than 5,000 people. 
It is important that when one of our own perishes serving our Nation 
they receive the proper respect.

I am joined today in support of this legislation by the Military 
Order of the Purple Heart and Society of Military Widows. In endorsing 
the legislation, the Society of Military Widows stated: ''We strongly 
feel that Federal agencies within the State should comply with this 
order to honor fallen native sons and daughters. As military widows, we 
can especially appreciate this visible show of respect.''

I would like to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this 
legislation and those who have helped champion its passage, including 
Chairman Conyers, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Franks, as well as 
Congressman Pastor, Congressman Visclosky, and Congressman Lamborn.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
