Mr. PASCRELL. That dog doesn't hunt anymore. I'm sorry.

Three things that are never discussed on this floor, never. Number 1, 
the pilferaging that's going on in Iraq right now make the few hairs we 
have on our head left stand on end. It is a disgrace that the American 
people's money has been stolen, to this day.

Number 2, by the way yesterday, let me tell you what progress is. A 
half hour of electricity yesterday in Baghdad. I want to hear progress. 
Secondly, the redeployment of our troops. No one is saying cut and run. 
No one's saying throw out the American flag. You won't discuss 
redeployment to the borders to protect the safe havens.

Number 3, let's talk about the amount of refugees that are in Iraq. 
Two million have left the country. What about the 1 million of Iraqis 
who have had to get out of their homes, who have no food or shelter?

Don't you talk about progress. That dog doesn't hunt any longer. Face 
the facts. This is not reality TV.
