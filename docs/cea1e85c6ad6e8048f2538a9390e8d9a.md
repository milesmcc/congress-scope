Mr. McCONNELL. I don't have the floor, I say to my friend from 
Arizona. Maybe he can get the Senator from Illinois to yield for a 
question as well.

I don't think we want to complain about the fact we haven't been 
attacked again since 9/11, I say to my friend from Illinois. Containing 
terrorists at Guantanamo, going after terrorists in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, clearly something worked. And to argue we would somehow be 
made more safe in this country by closing down Guantanamo I find 
borders almost on the absurd.
