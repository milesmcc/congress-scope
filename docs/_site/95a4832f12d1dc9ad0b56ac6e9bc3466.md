`Mr. McCAUL of Texas â€” 21 June 2007`

---


Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of 
this amendment offered by Mr. Wolf of Virginia to restore $158 million 
to this bill for democracy, governance, rule of law and human rights 
programs. In addition, it will fund nonproliferation and anti-terrorist 
programs.

Mr. Chairman, the debate in this Chamber over the future of Iraq and 
the best course of action has been passionate and divisive. Each Member 
of this House has their own opinion, yet the one thing we should be 
united on is that our end goal should be the same, a secure and stable 
Iraq.

Unfortunately, this bill predetermines failure by cutting off all 
funds to important democracy-building programs in Iraq. The majority 
has chosen to use this bill, as they have attempted several times 
already this year, to force a premature end to Iraq's pursuit of 
freedom and democracy. This will only lead to chaos and instability in 
the region.

As a consultant to the Iraq Study Group, along with Mr. Wolf of 
Virginia, we introduced a bipartisan bill, the Iraq Study Group 
Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007 which provides a 
comprehensive set of recommendations and a plan of action to succeed in 
Iraq. Included in these recommendations are suggestions for funding 
democracy, governance and rule of law, all the items that are funded by 
this amendment.

This bill has garnered 52 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, 
who have recognized the potential we have by implementing these 
recommendations together and moving forward as a united Congress. If we 
allow this bill to pass without the money for building an Iraq 
democracy, we condemn our mission to failure and declare that the 
sacrifices we made over the past several years were in vain. It will 
also squander any opportunity we have to give the Iraq Study Group 
recommendations a chance to succeed.

I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Wolf amendment.
