Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, what absolute lunacy; paying for a tax that 
was never intended.

I see my friend from New York. In 1969, when this tax was designed to 
go after 155 millionaires, was it ever anticipated that 23 million 
middle-income Americans would be shouldering this burden? Absolutely 
not. So we're supposed to pay for that? Well, the only thing that calls 
for paying for it is the budget that the new majority put into place.

Mr. Speaker, the American people sent us here to make laws, not to 
play games. We know that this is not going to become law. So time and 
time again, whether it's with our veterans, whether it's with 
children's health, whether it's with the war in Iraq, and now with our 
attempt to completely repeal the alternative minimum tax, we see 
nothing but game playing from our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle.

We do face economic challenges in this future, we know that. We've 
got some serious problems ahead. Ensuring that we keep this economy 
growing is essential. That's why we need to completely repeal the 
alternative minimum tax.
