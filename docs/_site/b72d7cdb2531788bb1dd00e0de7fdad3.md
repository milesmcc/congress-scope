Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my 
concerns about H.R. 2346, the war supplemental bill. Our troops deserve 
nothing less than a clean war supplemental bill, free from unrelated 
spending. We must give our troops the resources necessary to ensure 
victory in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I visited Iraq over the Memorial Day recess, my first trip back since 
having served there with the United States Marine Corps in al Anbar 
province. I cannot, with that trip still fresh in my memory, allow the 
needed support for our troops to be used as the hook to carry unneeded 
and distasteful spending.

The bill now requires the United States to borrow money that we don't 
have to loan it to the International Monetary Fund. The International 
Monetary Fund can then loan this money to nations like Iran and 
Venezuela.

Madam Speaker, it is inappropriate to use our troops to cram through 
overseas bailouts. I will vote against this and ask my colleagues to 
join me.
