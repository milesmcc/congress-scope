# INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

`Mr. ISSA â€” 11 March 2008`

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I am astounded that you can use the words 
''torture'' and ''waterboarding'' as though you were not on the 
committee of jurisdiction knowing about it as an ex-officio at the time 
it is to have occurred. I am shocked that this is going to be all about 
a procedure or procedures that in fact the Speaker of the House had the 
ability to know about and condoned for years. I am shocked that the 
Speaker of the House would speak about David Petraeus, when in fact 
David Petraeus has said publicly and privately: ''You know, on the 
battlefield of Iraq, I can kill the enemy, but I can't listen to him if 
he calls America.''

This today should be about what we haven't done. We haven't taken up 
the Senate's FISA bill. We haven't dealt with the fact that we are in 
danger every day, and as a member of the intelligence community, I know 
just how damaging the absence of action has been.

This bill has become a partisan bill, and wrongly so. I call on my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fix it and move on, rather 
than complaining about something that the Speaker is well aware of.
