Mr. MURTHA. I would say to my good friend from New Jersey, he voted 
for the $459 billion bill where we had a CR that fully funded the 
MRAPs, fully funded, $16 billion for the year. We are not holding up 
the MRAPs. And we provided the transportation.



We were very careful with this bill. The gentleman knows how careful 
I am in taking care of the troops. The gentleman knows how careful he 
is in taking care of the troops. None of us are trying to put 
roadblocks in the way. What we are trying to do is hold the 
administration accountable for what they have done. We want stability 
in the whole Middle East, not just in Iraq. So we have got to focus 
also on the future of the country. Russia is starting to come up, China 
is starting to come up. And in our bill, which the gentleman from New 
Jersey was a part of, we started to look ahead. Iraq is occupying us as 
well as we occupying Iraq.

So I have to say to the gentleman, I just want to make sure we keep 
the facts straight. We have fully funded the MRAPS, even though it's 
costing $150,000 per MRAP to get them overseas because of the lateness 
of the request.
