Mr. PERRIELLO. We will not solve Afghanistan without dealing with 
corruption internally and with Pakistan externally. And finally, we 
have a President who's negotiating from a position of strength, not 
weakness, unlike the last two administrations.

So I rise today with a grave seriousness about the supplemental 
before us but also a sense that we're on the right track with this new 
national security strategy. I believe that it is the right thing to do 
to support it.
