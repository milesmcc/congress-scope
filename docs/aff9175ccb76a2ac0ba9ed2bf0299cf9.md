`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 27 September 2008`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize 
Frank W. Buckles. Mr. Buckles, at the age of 107, is the last known 
remaining veteran of World War I.

Having joined the Army at the age of 16, Mr. Buckles fought bravely 
for his Nation in World War I. During the Second World War, as a 
civilian he was imprisoned by the Japanese and spent 39 months in 
captivity.

The freedoms we enjoy today and the prosperity our nation has enjoyed 
throughout its history are due in large part to the sacrifice and 
courage of men and women like Mr. Buckles. As the son of a World War II 
veteran and a former member of the National Guard and Reserve myself, I 
know firsthand and am grateful for the tremendous legacy of patriotism 
shared by our military. I am the proud to be the father of four sons 
who serve in our nation's military, including two sons who served in 
Iraq.

In honor of his sacrifice and dedication to his country, Frank 
Buckles was recognized by President George W. Bush earlier this year 
during a ceremony honoring World War I veterans. On September 24th, the 
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, Southern 
Jurisdiction honored Mr. Buckles by bestowing upon him the Scottish 
Rite honor and rank of Knight Commander of the Court of Honour. As a 
fellow mason, I am proud of the tradition of brotherhood and dedication 
to freedom that masons embody.

I congratulate and thank Frank Buckles for his service to our Nation.
