Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, it is with honor and with a 
profound sadness that I rise to recognize Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy 
of the United States Navy, who last week was posthumously awarded our 
Nation's highest award for valor: the Medal of Honor.

Among my greatest privileges was attending last week's ceremonial 
presentations of the Medal of Honor to his family at the White House 
and the Navy Memorial.

Known fondly as ''Murph,'' Michael was born on May 7, 1976, in 
Smithtown, New York, and grew up in Patchogue, in my district on 
eastern Long Island. He was raised by a family of policemen, 
lifeguards, firemen, and teachers who instilled values reflecting that 
public service is a noble calling.

In high school, Lieutenant Murphy life-guarded at the Brookhaven town 
beach in Lake Ronkonkoma, a job he returned to each summer through his 
college years. He graduated from Patchogue-Medford High School in 1994.

Lieutenant Murphy attended Penn State University, where he was an 
exceptional all-around athlete and student. He excelled at ice hockey, 
graduated with honors, and was accepted to several law schools, but 
instead wanted to serve his country as part of the world's most elite 
fighting force: the U.S. Navy SEALs.

Slightly built at 5 feet, 10 inches, he attended SEAL mentoring 
sessions at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point and was 
accepted to the Navy Officer Candidate School in 2000. Lieutenant 
Murphy was commissioned as an ensign and after 6 months completed Basic 
Underwater Demolition SEAL training in 2001. He then attended Army Jump 
School, SEAL Qualification Training, SEAL Delivery Vehicle School, and 
earned his SEAL Trident by 2002.

Lieutenant Murphy was later deployed to Qatar and to the Horn of 
Africa in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2005, Lieutenant 
Murphy was assigned to SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team ONE as assistant 
officer in charge of ALFA Platoon and deployed to Afghanistan in 
support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

Madam Speaker, the Congressional Medal of Honor commemorates 
Lieutenant Murphy's actions as the officer in charge of a four-man SEAL 
unit in support of Operation Red Wing, tasked with finding a key 
Taliban commander in the mountainous terrain of northeastern 
Afghanistan.

On June 28, 2005, shortly after inserting into the objective area, 
the SEALs were spotted by three goat herders who were initially 
detained and then released. It is believed they reported the SEALs' 
presence to Taliban fighters.

A fierce gun battle ensued on the steep face of the mountain between 
the SEALs and a much larger enemy force. Despite the intensity of the 
firefight and suffering grave gunshot wounds himself, Lieutenant Murphy 
is credited with risking his own life to save the lives of his 
teammates.

He had moved into the open where he could gain a better position to 
transmit a call for help. This deliberate and heroic act deprived him 
of cover and made him a target for the enemy. While continuing to be 
fired upon, he made contact with Bagram Air Base to request assistance. 
He calmly reported his unit's location and the size of the enemy force 
while requesting support for his team.

He was shot in the back, causing him to drop the transmitter. He 
picked it back up, completed the call, and continued firing at the 
enemy closing in. Severely wounded, he returned to his men and 
continued the battle.

In response to Lieutenant Murphy's call, an MH-47 Chinook helicopter, 
with eight additional SEALs and eight Army Night Stalkers aboard, was 
sent. As the Chinook drew near, a rocket-propelled grenade hit the 
helicopter, causing it to crash, killing all 16 men aboard.

On the ground and nearly out of ammunition, the four SEALs continued 
to fight. After 2 hours Lieutenant Murphy, Matthew Axelson, and Daniel 
Dietz had fallen. Over 30 Taliban were also killed.

The fourth SEAL, Petty Officer Marcus Luttrell, was knocked 
unconscious and over a ridge by the blast of a rocket-propelled 
grenade. Though severely wounded, he evaded the enemy for nearly a day 
and was rescued by local nationals who cared for him until U.S. forces 
arrived for him 3 days later.

Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy was buried at Calverton National 
Cemetery, less than 20 miles from his hometown. His other awards 
include the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, the Joint Service 
Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, 
Afghanistan Campaign Ribbon, and National Defense Service Medal.

Throughout his life, he was known for his unwavering loyalty and an 
instinctive responsibility to help others. With unwavering courage in 
the face of certain death, he gave his life for his country and 
teammates, reflecting great credit upon himself and upholding the 
Navy's highest traditions.

Madam Speaker, our Nation is blessed to have a military full of great 
Americans like Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy who are serving with great 
distinction. He epitomized the selfless devotion to duty our young men 
and women have demonstrated time and again in Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
other hostile regions. My heart goes out to the Murphy family and the 
people of Patchogue, New York, for they have lost one of America's very 
finest.
