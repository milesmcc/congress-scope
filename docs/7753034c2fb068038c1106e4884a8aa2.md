Mr. DONNELLY. Madam Speaker, today I honor a brave man who has served 
his country in the military and his community as a patrolman in the 
South Bend Police Department. Patrolman Michael Norby put his life at 
risk in the execution of his duty. In the early morning of April 24, 
2007, he and his partner, Corporal Nick Polizzotto, confronted an armed 
suspect. Both officers were shot; Corporal Polizzotto died and 
Patrolman Norby was injured. The two officers responded to a report of 
gunshots without regard for their own safety, only the safety of the 
community.

During his one and a half years on the force, Michael has received 
three commendations. Prior to his service on the police force, he 
served with the United States Army in support of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom earning the Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, 
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, 
''M'' Device Award and Noncommissioned Officer's Professional 
Development Ribbon.

Madam Speaker, I commend the men and women who dedicate their lives 
in the service of others, particularly Patrolman Norby, to whom we owe 
deep gratitude.
