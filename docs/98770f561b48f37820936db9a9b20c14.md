# ORDER OF PROCEDURE

`Mr. REID â€” 31 January 2007`

Mr. REID. Madam President, I have already apologized to staff and 
others for having to wait around so long, but sometimes it takes a long 
time to get from here to there.

I, first of all, want to acknowledge the hard work of so many 
different people that allowed us to get where we are today, which 
certainly isn't the finish line, but it is a starting point.

People have heard me on other occasions, on other matters, talk about 
the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner. In my 25 years in the Congress--
and I say this without any reservation--I have not had dealings with 
anyone who better represents, in my mind, what a Senator should be. Not 
only does he look the part and act the part, but he is truly what our 
Founding Fathers had in mind when they talked about this deliberative 
body.

So I appreciate very much the bipartisan work of the Senator from 
Virginia, Mr. Warner. He has worked with other Senators--I don't know 
who he has worked with, but some I am aware of because I have read 
about them: Senators Collins, Hagel, Ben Nelson, Snowe, Biden, Coleman, 
and I am sure there are others.

Today Senator Warner and others submitted a new version of his 
concurrent resolution regarding the increase of troop levels in 
Iraq. Senator Levin has taken that language, and tonight we will 
introduce it as a bill. It will be introduced as a bill because that is 
the only way we can arrive at a point where we can start a deliberate 
debate on this most important issue. We will introduce this as a bill 
which will begin the rule XIV process in order to get it to the 
calendar and allow the Senate to move to Senator Warner's legislation. 
We would prefer to do it as a concurrent resolution; however, that 
would only be the case if it would be open to complete substitute 
amendments, for obvious reasons.


In order to permit the Senate to consider amendments which are 
appropriate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of Senator Warner's concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 
7, on Monday, February 5, at 12 noon, and that the entire concurrent 
resolution be open to amendments and that a cloture motion with respect 
to S. Con. Res. 2 be vitiated.
