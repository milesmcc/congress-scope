`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 8 November 2007`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to bid a 
fond farewell to a member of my staff, Brian Eisele. Brian will be 
leaving our office to join the staff of South Carolina Senator Jim 
DeMint. Although I will miss his presence, I am confident Brian will be 
a tremendous addition to Senator DeMint's staff.

Brian came to the Hill earlier this year as an intern for Congressman 
Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania. His hard work, professionalism, 
thoughtfulness and personal integrity have been an enormous asset to 
the people of the 2nd District of South Carolina. He will certainly be 
difficult to replace.

A graduate of the University of South Carolina, Brian is the son of 
David, an Iraq war veteran, and Denise Eisele of Aiken, South Carolina. 
South Carolina is proud of its native son, and I'm excited for Brian's 
success. I wish him all the best in the years to come.

Brian has a bright future as a capable and competent public servant, 
and I look forward to working with him in the future.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th.
