Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, American families continue to struggle in the 
face of this recession and yet in 1 day the Bush administration spends 
$339 million on the war in Iraq.

As General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker appear before Congress 
this week to defend this occupation, congressional Democrats have many 
questions about the costs of this occupation. This country has spent 
more than $500 billion in Iraq. It could go up to 3 to $4 trillion. Yet 
47 million Americans have no health insurance.

Last month, then GAO Comptroller David Walker stated the Iraqis have 
a budget surplus. We have a huge budget deficit.

One of the questions is who should be paying? That's a really good 
question, considering that we are currently pumping billions of dollars 
into this war, which is stimulating economies in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi 
Arabia while the American economy is in recession. What about investing 
money here instead of in education, health care and infrastructure to 
create jobs?

This occupation has placed a massive human and financial cost on the 
United States, and yet President Bush demands more of the same. We must 
end this occupation and bring our troops home.
