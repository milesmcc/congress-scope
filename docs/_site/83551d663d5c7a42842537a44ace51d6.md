Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman.

I want to pick up on two of the things that he mentioned because I 
think these are fascinating contrasts and put into perspective some of 
the challenges that we face.

First, on the subject of oil prices and gasoline prices, he mentioned 
that 300, the price of gasoline has gone up 300 percent since 2001. 
What's interesting is, when you look at what we're now paying in Iraq 
for gasoline, this is one of the truly astounding and very disturbing 
aspects of our involvement there.


And again, as my colleague, our colleague, Mr. Ellison said, we're 
going to be voting on more funding for the Iraq war tomorrow. The 
American people need to know that right now we are spending $153 
million a month on gasoline in Iraq, $153 million a month. And we're 
paying $3.23 a gallon for that gasoline. It's probably up since then, 
but the time that we have the statistics, $3.23 we're paying for 
gasoline in Iraq.

Meanwhile, the Iraqi people, and Iraq is sitting on one of the 
largest oil reserves in the world, the Iraqi people are paying a 
subsidized cost of $1.30 a gallon. Now, wouldn't we all love to pay 
$1.30 a gallon?

Now, that's unrealistic, but it's interesting that we're paying for 
the entire reconstruction cost of Iraq, we have up to this point; we're 
spending all this money to try and stabilize their country, and we're 
paying $2 more per gallon for gasoline than the Iraqi people are. 
That's just one of the strange quirks of our involvement there.
