Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of LCpl 
Raul S. Bravo, Jr. who died on Saturday, March 3, 2007, of injuries 
sustained in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Lance Corporal Bravo, who was on his second tour of duty in Iraq, was 
killed by a roadside bomb during combat operations in the city of Qaim, 
Anbar province, Iraq. Lance Corporal Bravo was assigned to the 3rd 
Battalion, 4th Marines, 1st Marine Division, Marine Corps Air Ground 
Combat Center.

Lance Corporal Bravo, a 2004 graduate of Elko High School, was a hero 
whose desire to serve his country will forever make an impact on his 
family, his community and his country. He joined the United States 
Marine Corps to serve his country in the global war on terror. He will 
not only be remembered for his sacrifice and willing service, but for 
the extraordinary person that he was. His warmth and optimism 
brightened the lives of his family and friends.

Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of LCpl Raul S. Bravo, 
Jr. who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country while fighting the 
war on terror and defending democracy and freedom.
