 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am necessarily absent to 
attend a funeral, and therefore will miss rollcall vote No. 346 on the 
Levin-Reed amendment to provide for a reduction and transition of U.S. 
forces in Iraq. As a cosponsor of this amendment, had I been present, I 
would have voted ''yea.''

(At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to 
be printed in the Record.)
