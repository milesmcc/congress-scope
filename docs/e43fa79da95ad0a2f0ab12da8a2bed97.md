Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I am grateful to 
recognize the South Carolina Army National Guard's 218th Brigade Combat 
Team who was recently honored with the Joint Meritorious Unit Award. 
Presented by the Department of Defense's Joint Chiefs of Staff, this 
award is given to units that have achieved distinction in their duties 
and is the second highest award given to a military unit.

The 218th, led by Major General Bob Livingston, served for a year in 
Afghanistan as part of Task Force Phoenix advising and training Afghan 
police and army forces. As a result of their heroic and dedicated 
service, Afghanistan has doubled the size of its army to 52,000 troops, 
and the number of Afghan police officers killed in action each month 
has been cut dramatically.

As a 28 year veteran of the 218th, I want to extend my gratitude and 
that of the entire nation to Major General Stan Spears, commander of 
the South Carolina National Guard, Major General Livingston, his brave 
soldiers and their families for their tremendous commitment to 
protecting American families by defeating terrorists overseas.
