Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, Americans are divided over many 
issues, but we are not divided over health care for our children. We 
are a good people, and we want our children to have health care. None 
of us want to see children in this country without health care; none, 
except for the President and his Republican supporters in Congress, 
that is.

Madam Speaker, the President and his supporters in Congress want to 
take hardworking American tax dollars and spend them, but not on the 
kids; no, in Iraq, in the middle of a civil war, with the $190 billion, 
which is the President's new request for Iraq, as he turns around to 
the children and the hardworking families of America and says, Just 
don't get sick, kids.

Mr. President, that is not acceptable.
