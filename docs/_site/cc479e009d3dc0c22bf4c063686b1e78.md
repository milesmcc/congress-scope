`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 22 March 2007`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that this is a 
difficult day for me.

I voted against this war from the very beginning when this vote was 
not politically popular. I was an original member of the Out of Iraq 
Caucus.

As far back as 2005 I introduced legislation to end funding for the 
war, which I believe has been one of the worst political, military, 
diplomatic and moral blunders in our Nation's history.

My bill calls for the immediate, safe and orderly withdrawal of all 
of our troops from Iraq, and I urge my colleagues to join me in that 
legislation.

I want this war to come to an end today. Unfortunately, and to my 
deep disappointment, not enough of my colleagues, Democrat or 
Republican, believe as I do.

I have come to the conclusion that defeating the supplemental bill 
before us today would send a message to George Bush and Dick Cheney 
that they will continue to have a free pass


from this Congress to do whatever the hell they want to do.

The Bush administration, with their ''Mission Accomplished'' banners 
and their shifting rationales, must be held to account. We simply 
cannot trust them any longer. I lost my trust in this administration a 
long, long time ago.

I fear that defeating this bill would result in more of the same, 
more deceit and empty promises, more ignored benchmarks and missed 
deadlines, more American casualties, more debt passed on to our 
children and our grandchildren, more harm to our reputation around the 
world, and more war.

I cannot do that. I will not do that. So I will vote ''yes.''

This is not the bill that I want. This is not the bill that I would 
have written. But it is the bill that the Appropriations Committee has 
presented to us today, and it is a bill that reflects the hard reality 
that this is the toughest measure that we can get passed and get 218 
votes for.

For the first time, we can mandate real and meaningful deadlines that 
clearly reflect the disgust so many of us have with how this war has 
been conducted.

This bill also provides $1.7 billion to address the health care needs 
of our veterans, particularly those suffering from traumatic brain 
injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Too many of our veterans 
can't even get diagnosed, let alone treated. That is wrong, and this 
bill begins to fix it.

Quite frankly, I have concluded that this bill is the best that we 
can do, for now. I say that very deliberately, ''for now,'' because 
those of us who oppose this war will continue our efforts to end it. I 
want all of our troops out of Iraq and back home with their families 
where they belong.

I will propose much stronger language and, indeed, continue to press 
for the immediate withdrawal of all of our troops in the defense bills 
that are coming in the weeks ahead.

My old boss, Joe Moakley, stares at me from his portrait every day in 
the Rules Committee. He used to say that if the Democratic Party were 
in Europe, we would be 16 different parties.

So I want to just take a moment to commend the leadership of Dave 
Obey and Jack Murtha and Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn and Rahm Emanuel for 
all of their hard work these past few weeks. They have anguished over 
this issue, as all of us have.

And I especially want to commend our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. She has 
been a forceful and effective opponent of this war from the very 
beginning, and I know she will continue to do all that she can to bring 
all of us, Republicans and Democrats, together to finally bring this 
terrible war to an end.

I am grateful to my colleagues in the Out of Iraq Caucus for their 
continued and forceful leadership. And I also want to thank all of the 
national and grass-roots activists and organizations who have done so 
much to oppose this war. I truly believe that the American people are 
way ahead of the politicians in Washington on this issue, and it is my 
hope that some day soon Congress and the White House will catch up.
