Mr. CRITZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hundreds-of-
thousands of U.S. service members and veterans impacted by traumatic 
brain injuries.

Earlier this morning, Congressman Bill Pascrell and I welcomed 
Pennsylvania State Representative Bryan Barbin to the U.S. Capitol. 
Representative Barbin completed a seven-day motorcycle ride through 
seven state capitals to raise awareness of the impact of traumatic 
brain injuries, and to deliver the following resolution that was 
adopted by the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania on June 23, 2010. It reads:




 Whereas, More than 1.5 million United States military 


 personnel have deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since the 


 start of military operations in 2001, and military statistics 


 show that at least 115,000 troops have suffered brain 


 injuries related to IED explosions since the Iraq and 


 Afghanistan wars began; and



 Whereas, Brain injury has been labeled a signature injury 


 of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and brain injuries 


 occurring among soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan are 


 strongly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and 


 physical health problems after soldiers return home; and



 Whereas, Concern has been emerging about the possible long-


 term effects of combat-related brain injuries. Significant 


 numbers of undiagnosed injuries and the failure by medical 


 personnel to include such information in soldiers' permanent 


 medical files has been identified as serious in studies 


 prepared by medical and army experts; and



 Whereas, Without diagnosis and official documentation, 


 soldiers with head wounds have struggled to receive 


 appropriate treatment, sometimes receiving psychotropic drugs 


 instead of rehabilitative therapy that could help retrain 


 their brains; and



 Whereas, The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, 


 DVBIC, in Johnstown has been assisting returning veterans 


 with rehabilitative therapy since 2006; and



 Whereas, In January 2009, Congress mandated DVBIC to 


 establish an assisted living pilot program to determine the 


 best practices to rehabilitate soldiers with mild, moderate 


 or severe traumatic brain injuries to enable them to return 


 to their own communities, therefore be it



 Resolved, That the House of Representatives designate July 


 7, 2010, as ''Combat-Related Brain Injury and Post Traumatic 


 Stress Disorder Awareness Day'' in Pennsylvania to promote 


 public understanding and encourage all citizens to help bind 


 the wounds of our returning soldiers.





Madam Speaker, I would like to commend State Representative Barbin 
for his advocacy on behalf of this important cause.
