Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I would 
like to close.

I close by saying there is no more powerful way to honor the death of 
an American than flying our Nation's flag at half-staff. Recognizing 
this, Governors across this great country have issued proclamations to 
honor servicemembers from their States who have died in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

This quiet sign of respect is a powerful message to the family that a 
grateful Nation and a grateful community mourns and honors the 
sacrifice made by their fallen hero. It is also representative of the 
shared loss felt by our communities who mourn a family member, a 
friend, a neighbor and a colleague.

The Army Specialist Joseph P. Micks Flag Code Amendment Act will 
ensure that each of our fallen heroes receives the ultimate honor due 
to Joe and his family; his wife, Romona; and parents, Ken and Amy 
Micks. To them we owe a great debt of gratitude. I hope this 
legislation passes the House today and moves to the Senate, and we can 
get it completed by Flag Day on June 14.
