`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 10 July 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we have 
been here before. Every Iraq amendment we have voted on this year--and 
there have been numerous amendments--in fact, I have sort of lost track 
of how many we have had--every single one of them, as most things in 
the Senate that are remotely controversial, requires 60 votes. I 
believe I am correct in saying that every Iraq amendment we have voted 
on this year, no matter what the underlying bill was to which the 
amendment was being offered, was in a 60-vote contest.

What we have frequently done is simply negotiated an agreement to 
have the 60 votes we know we are going to have anyway, and the reason 
for that is--well, there are several reasons. No. 1, if a cloture vote 
were invoked, it would further delay consideration of the bill because 
potentially 30 more hours could be used postcloture on an amendment. So 
what we have done, in a rational response to the nature of the Senate 
in this era, is to negotiate 60-vote votes.

We are perfectly happy to enter into an agreement, as I suggested 
yesterday, for a vote on the Webb amendment and the alternative that we 
would have, the Graham amendment, by consent, two 60-vote requirements. 
That is not unusual in the Senate; it is just common practice in the 
Senate, certainly for as long as I have been here. So, therefore, I 
object.
