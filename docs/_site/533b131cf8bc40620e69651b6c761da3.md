Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, today I join with the hundreds of 
thousands of Dominican residents of my congressional district and 
across our Nation to commemorate today, February 27th, the 164th 
anniversary of the Dominican Republic's Day of Independence. This 
celebration comes at the tail end of what has been a momentous 
Dominican Heritage Month.

Dominican Heritage Month gave us the opportunity to acknowledge and 
applaud the economic, cultural, and social contributions Dominican 
Americans have made to this great Nation. Dominicans living in our 
shores have been motivated by the value of hard work and the bonds of 
family--the same pillars of our society that has built this great 
Nation for over 230 years.

It also gave us an opportunity to consider the many Dominican 
achievements, on the island and in the United States. Many of our 
hemisphere's first institutions were established on the shores of 
Quisqueya, including the first cathedral and the oldest university.

Since the initial wave of Dominican migration in the 1960's to the 
most recent arrivals of today, Dominicans have worked hard to 
contribute to our national identity, educating us all on their culture 
and traditions and enriching the quality of our shared futures. Their 
contributions can also be found in every facet of U.S. life--from the 
many baseball stars in our national pastime, to fashion legend Oscar de 
la Renta to the thousands of professionals that do battle as soldiers, 
doctors, lawyers, journalists, educators, and public servants.

This past year, the Dominican community and I shared the loss of our 
fallen soldier, Cpl. Juan Alcantara, who lost his life tragically on 
August 6, 2007 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. We also shared 
the grief of Hurricane Noel, the deadliest storm of the 2007 hurricane 
season, responsible for at least 140 deaths and the displacement of 
more than 80,000 people in the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican people are known to triumph in the face of tragedy. 
They first began their campaign for the independence of the Dominican 
Republic in 1831 under the leadership of Juan Pablo Duarte, who formed 
a secret society named The Trinity. Thirteen years later, he succeeded 
in commanding a decisive uprising, which resulted in independence for 
the Dominican Republic. After the long and hard campaign for freedom 
had ended, a ceremonial musket shot fired on February 27, 1844 marked 
the Dominican Republic's first official Independence Day.

Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me 
in marking this celebration of not just the independence and triumphs 
of the Dominican people, but also the invaluable impact that they have 
had on our Nation and the world.
