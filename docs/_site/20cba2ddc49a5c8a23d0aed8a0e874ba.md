# MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTER EMPOWERMENT (MOVE) ACT OF 2009
## `20cba2ddc49a5c8a23d0aed8a0e874ba`
`Mr. SCHUMER â€” 27 May 2010`

---


Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, since becoming chairman of the Committee 
on Rules and Administration with jurisdiction over Federal elections, I 
have come to have a better appreciation for and deeper understanding of 
the obstacles and barriers that our military men and women serving 
abroad and at home and U.S. citizens living in foreign lands encounter 
when they try to vote.

As I explained at a Rules Committee hearing held in May of 2009, 
every couple of years around election time, there is a great push to 
improve military and overseas voting. But as soon as the election is 
over, Congress all too often forgets the plight of these voters.

But last year, Congress delivered. Our motive was simple--we wanted 
to break down the barriers to voting for our soldiers, sailors, and 
citizens living overseas. On a bipartisan basis, we agreed that it was 
unacceptable that in the age of global communications, many active 
military, their families, and thousands of other Americans living, 
working, and volunteering in foreign countries cannot cast a ballot at 
home while they are serving or living overseas. For our military, what 
especially moved us to act was the fact that they can fight and put 
their life on the line for their country, but they can't choose their 
next commander-in-chief. This shouldn't happen--not in the United 
States of America where elections are the bedrock of our democracy.

With the 2010 elections less than 7 months away, a new law is on the 
books. The provisions of the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment 
Act, MOVE Act, of 2009 were incorporated in Public Law 111-84, the 
National Defense Authorization Act of 2010. This law will make it 
easier for members of our Armed Forces and citizens living abroad to 
receive accurate, timely election information and the resources and 
logistical support to register and vote and have that vote count.

Mr. President, a legislative history of the MOVE Act is as follows:









 Background and Purpose of the MOVE Act




 American citizens believe voting is one of the most 


 treasured of our liberties and a right to be defended at any 


 cost. It is therefore unacceptable that our military men and 


 women serving abroad and at home, who put their lives on the 


 line every day to defend this right, often face obstacles in 


 exercising their right to vote.



 Empirical evidence confirms that members of the military 


 and citizens living overseas who have attempted to vote 


 through the absentee balloting procedures that has been in 


 place for the last 30 years were often unable to do so. The 


 reasons were many, including insufficient information about 


 military and overseas voting procedures, failure by States to 


 send absentee ballots in time for military and overseas 


 voters to cast them, and endemic bureaucratic obstacles that 


 prevent these voters from having their votes counted. While 


 the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, 


 UOCAVA, enacted in 1986, created a Federal framework for both 


 military and overseas citizens to vote it was clear that, in 


 order to break down these barriers to voting, UOCAVA was in 


 need of an overhaul.



 A history of congressional efforts to aid military and 


 overseas voters highlights the obstacles faced by these 


 voters. In 1942, the first Federal law was enacted to help 


 military members vote in Federal elections. The Soldier 


 Voting Act of 1942 was the first law to guarantee Federal 


 voting rights for servicemembers during wartime. It allowed 


 servicemembers to vote in elections for Federal office 


 without having to register and instituted the first iteration 


 of the Federal Post Card Application for servicemembers to 


 request an absentee ballot. Though this was a commendable 


 first effort by Congress, the 1942 law's provisions only 


 applied during a time of war, and barriers to voting 


 remained. In 1951, President Truman commissioned a study from 


 the American Political Science Association on the problem of 


 military voting. Recognizing the difficulties faced by 


 military members serving overseas during World War II and the 


 Korean War in trying to vote, President Truman wrote a letter 


 to Congress that called on our legislators to fix the 


 problem. In response, Congress passed the Federal Voting 


 Assistance Act, FVAA, in 1955 which recommended--but did not 


 guarantee--absentee registration and voting for military 


 members, Federal employees serving abroad, and members of 


 service organizations affiliated with the military. In 1968, 


 FVAA was amended to cover U.S. citizens temporarily living 


 outside of the United States, thus increasing the number and 


 scope of U.S. citizens that fell within the law's purview. In 


 1975, the Overseas Citizens




 Voting Rights Act at last guaranteed military and overseas 


 voters the right to register and vote by absentee procedures. 


 In 1986, Congress enacted UOCAVA as the primary military and 


 overseas voting law, incorporating the expansion of rights 


 granted under prior Federal legislation and making several 


 significant advances to improve military and overseas voting. 


 UOCAVA has been the operational voting framework provided to 


 military and overseas voters.



 UOCAVA's main provisions placed several mandates on States. 


 First, States must allow members of the uniformed services, 


 their families, and citizens residing overseas to register 


 and vote by absentee procedures for all elections for Federal 


 office including all general, primary, special and runoff 


 elections. Second, States are required under UOCAVA to accept 


 and process all valid voter registration applications 


 submitted by military and overseas voters--as long as the 


 application is received no less than 30 days prior to an 


 election. Third, UOCAVA created the Federal write-in absentee 


 ballot, FWAB, a failsafe backup ballot for Federal general 


 elections.



 Congress has amended UOCAVA several times over the last 24 


 years. The 1998 amendments included certain reporting 


 requirements on States to provide information on military and 


 overseas voting participation; and the 2001 amendments 


 required States to accept the Federal Post Card Application, 


 FPCA, as a combined voter registration and absentee ballot 


 request form, and gave voters the opportunity to request that 


 the FPCA be a standing absentee ballot request for each 


 subsequent Federal election in the voter's State that year. 


 In 2002, the Help America Vote Act, HAVA, modified this 


 provision to allow voters to automatically request an 


 absentee ballot through the FPCA for the two subsequent 


 regularly scheduled Federal election cycles after the 


 election for which the FPCA was originally submitted. HAVA 


 also added a number of substantive provisions to UOCAVA, 


 including a provision to give voting assistance officers the 


 time and resources to provide voting guidance and information 


 to active duty military personnel, a mandate that the 


 Secretary of each branch of the Armed Forces provide 


 information to service personnel regarding the last date that 


 an absentee ballot can reasonably be expected to arrive on 


 time, and a requirement that States identify a single office 


 for communication with UOCAVA voters. Finally, Congress 


 amended UOCAVA in 2004 to allow military personnel to use the 


 Federal write-in absentee ballot, or FWAB, from within the 


 territorial United States.



 Despite these improvements over the years, evidence 


 revealed that significant barriers to voting continued for 


 military and overseas citizens. Registration among military 


 voters has been shown to be substantially lower than among 


 other voting-eligible U.S. citizens. According to testimony 


 submitted by hearing witnesses, in 2006, the registration 


 rate among military personnel was 64.86 percent compared to a 


 registration rate of 83.8 percent for the general voting age 


 population. According to one survey of military and overseas 


 voters conducted after the 2008 election, of those overseas 


 voters who wanted to vote but were unable to do so, over one-


 third--34 percent--could not vote because of problems in the 


 registration process. The same survey found that even among 


 experienced overseas voters, nearly one-quarter--23.7 


 percent--experienced problems during the registration 


 process. Military and overseas voters have had to deal with a 


 lack of information about registration procedures and a slow, 


 cumbersome registration process that often turns into the 


 first roadblock to voting.



 Military and overseas voters also have trouble even when 


 they have been able to properly register. The Congressional 


 Research Service, CRS, found that during the 2008 election 


 military personnel and overseas citizens hailing from the 


 seven States with the highest number of deployed soldiers 


 requested 441,000 absentee ballots. Of these, 98,633 were 


 never received by local election officials. Further, survey 


 data shows that two out of every five military and overseas 


 voters, 39 percent--who requested an absentee ballot in 2008 


 received it from local election officials in the second half 


 of October or later--much too late for a ballot to be voted 


 and mailed back in time to be counted on election day. 


 Sending absentee ballots too late to have the opportunity to 


 actually vote is an unacceptable situation for military and 


 overseas Americans.



 Finally, some States reject ballots from military and 


 overseas voters for reasons unrelated to voter eligibility, 


 including unnecessary notarization requirements and criteria 


 such as the paper weight of the ballot or ballot envelope. As 


 many as 13,500 ballots were rejected from military and 


 overseas voters from the seven States with the greatest 


 number of troops deployed overseas.



 These numbers are totally unacceptable. These barriers 


 effectuate rampant disenfranchisement among our military and 


 overseas voters. Congress has a compelling interest to 


 protect the voting rights of American citizens, and it is 


 especially incumbent upon Congress to act when those very 


 individuals who are sworn to defend that freedom are unable 


 to exercise their right to vote.



 The need for sweeping improvement was clear. The Military 


 and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act is a complete renovation 


 of UOCAVA that brings it into the twenty-first century and 


 streamlines the process of absentee voting for military and 


 overseas voters through a series of common sense, 


 straightforward fixes.



 First, it allows military and overseas voters to request, 


 and when so requested, requires States to send, registration 


 materials, absentee ballot request forms, and blank absentee 


 ballots electronically. It ensures that military and overseas 


 voters have at least 45 days to receive and complete their 


 absentee ballots and return them to election officials. The 


 legislation also requires that absentee ballots from overseas 


 military personnel be sent through expedited mail procedures, 


 making it faster and easier to send voted ballots back to 


 local election officials. In addition, it prevents election 


 officials from rejecting overseas absentee ballots for 


 reasons not related to voter eligibility, like paper weight 


 and notarization requirements.



 Second, the MOVE Act expands accessibility and availability 


 of voting resources for military and overseas voters. It 


 shores up the Federal Voting Assistance Program, or FVAP, an 


 organization within the Department of Defense, DOD. Under the 


 provisions of MOVE, FVAP will make a number of improvements 


 to its voter education efforts for our military and other 


 Americans living and working abroad and serve as the central 


 administrative office for carrying out the Federal 


 responsibilities under UOCAVA and MOVE. It also increases the 


 usability and accessibility of the FWAB. This failsafe ballot 


 allows military and overseas voters to vote even when they 


 face a situation where they don't receive a State-issued 


 ballot in time. In addition to all these improvements, the 


 legislation advances voter registration for our military by 


 directing each of the Secretaries of the military departments 


 to designate offices in military installations where soldiers 


 and their families can register to vote, update their 


 registration information, and request an absentee ballot.



 The MOVE Act also aims to secure future voting rights for 


 military and overseas voters. It increases accountability for 


 future elections by directing the Department of Defense to 


 regularly report to Congress on their activities for 


 implementing the programs and requirements under MOVE, 


 including information on ballot delivery success rates. It 


 also authorizes the Defense Department to create a pilot 


 program testing new technologies for the future benefit of 


 military and overseas voters.



 The enactment of the provisions of the MOVE Act brings to 


 an end a system that could ever allow a quarter of ballots 


 requested by U.S. troops to go missing. It instead aims to 


 ensure that every single military and overseas vote be 


 counted.








 Committee Hearing and Consideration at Markup




 The Committee on Rules and Administration held a hearing on 


 May 13, 2009, which I chaired entitled ''Hearing on Problems 


 for Military and Overseas Voters: Why Many Soldiers and Their 


 Families Can't Vote.'' The first panel consisted of one 


 witness, Gail McGinn, Acting Under Secretary for Personnel 


 and Readiness for the Department of Defense. Testifying on 


 the second panel were Patricia Hollarn, board member of the 


 Overseas Vote Foundation and former supervisor of elections 


 in Okaloosa County, FL; Donald Palmer, director of the 


 Division of Elections at the Florida Department of State; LTC 


 Joseph DeCaro, active duty member of the U.S. Air Force, on 


 his own behalf; Eric Eversole, former attorney at the 


 Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Voting Rights 


 Section, adviser to the McCain-Palin campaign, and former 


 member of the Navy's Judge Advocate General Corps from 1999-


 2001; and Robert Carey, executive director of the National 


 Defense Committee.



 The hearing focused on the reasons why so many military and 


 overseas voters find it difficult or impossible to 


 effectively cast their ballots, with special attention paid 


 to recommendations from the witnesses who possess extensive 


 experience with the military and overseas absentee voting 


 process. The hearing opened with a discussion of the 


 preliminary results from a study of military and overseas 


 voting in 2008 conducted by the Congressional Research 


 Service. The findings showed that in several of the largest 


 military voting States, up to 27 percent of the ballots 


 requested by military and overseas voters were not counted 


 for one reason or another.



 Letters from soldiers serving abroad who wanted to cast 


 ballots in 2008 but were unable to do so were shared. One 


 letter from a soldier in Alaska concisely summarized the 


 problem underscored by the hearing: ''I hate that because of 


 my military service overseas, I was precluded from voting.''



 Gail McGinn, Acting Under Secretary for Personnel and 


 Readiness at the Department of Defense, testified in detail 


 about the logistical and administrative challenges facing 


 military and overseas voters. Ms. McGinn identified time, 


 distance, and mobility as the chief logistical barriers to 


 these voters. She said, ''Our legislative initiatives for 


 states and territories to improve ballot transit time are, 


 first, provide at least 45 days between the ballot mailing 


 date and the date that ballots are due; give state chief 


 election officials the authority to alter elections 


 procedures in emergency situations; provide a state write-in 


 absentee ballot to be sent out 90 to 180 days before all 


 elections; and expand the use of electronic transmission 


 alternatives for voting material.'' Ms. McGinn further 


 pointed out that 23 States do not provide the minimum of a 


 45-day round trip for military and overseas absentee ballots. 


 Patricia Hollarn, board member of the Overseas Vote 


 Foundation and




 former supervisor of elections in Okaloosa County, FL, 


 testified about her personal experience with local election 


 officials who, she said, had a lot of confusion about the 


 proper absentee balloting procedures they needed to provide 


 for overseas citizens and military personnel. She echoed Ms. 


 McGinn in recommending that States and local jurisdictions 


 provide a minimum of 45 days for absentee ballots to be 


 delivered to overseas voters, completed, and returned before 


 the state's deadline. She also emphasized the logistical 


 challenge facing the U.S. Postal Service and military mail 


 service with respect to the speedy delivery of overseas 


 ballots.



 Donald Palmer, director of the Division of Elections for 


 the Florida Department of State, testified about Florida's 


 experience serving its military and overseas voters. Mr. 


 Palmer said that providing 45 days for ballot transmission 


 and delivery, as Florida does, is ''prudent'' and 


 ''absolutely necessary, when relying solely on the mail 


 service.'' Mr. Palmer also discussed Florida's experience 


 using technology, including e-mail, fax, and the Internet, to 


 communicate with military and overseas voters and transmit 


 balloting materials to and from Americans abroad. Mr. Palmer 


 testified about an invitation from the Department of Defense 


 for Secretaries of State to travel to the Middle East and see 


 firsthand how soldiers receive their absentee ballots. 


 Florida Secretary of State Kurt Browning relayed to Mr. 


 Palmer that soldiers abroad many times do not have access to 


 fax machines and often use e-mail as a primary source of 


 communication and expressed their desire to be able to use 


 email or the internet to transmit balloting materials to 


 local election officials. Mr. Palmer also detailed pilot 


 programs in Florida which have used new technologies to 


 facilitate ballot transmission from abroad. He also described 


 Florida's efforts to work with the U.S. Postal Service to 


 reduce error rates in ballot delivery and to use intelligent 


 code technology to track absentee ballots while in the 


 Continental United States.



 United States Air Force LTC Joseph DeCaro, testifying on 


 his own behalf, described his personal experiences with 


 absentee voting while serving abroad in 2004. His experience 


 illustrates the burdens facing uniformed servicemembers 


 overseas who want to vote:




 Every moment I spent researching and coordinating with 


 state-side resources to be able to cast my ballot was against 


 any personal time off. The mission is and always must be the 


 main focus. Being deployed is difficult enough as it is . . . 


 I think every American should do what they can to cast their 


 ballot and make their voice heard. As with many other 


 citizens, I will continue to do this, but there should be a 


 better way in which [service personnel can] cast their ballot 


 while deployed.




 Lieutenant Colonel DeCaro also lamented that he had no way 


 of knowing whether the ballot he mailed to his local election 


 office would ever reach its destination.



 Eric Eversole, former attorney at the Department of Justice 


 Civil Rights Division, Voting Rights Section, began his 


 testimony by arguing that ''when it comes to the military 


 members' right to vote, we seem to forget their sacrifices 


 and we deny them the very voting rights that we ask them to 


 defend.'' He cited statistics which showed that only 26 


 percent of Florida's deployed servicemembers were able to 


 successfully request an absentee ballot in 2008. He also 


 echoed prior testimony that States should mail out absentee 


 ballots to military and overseas voters at least 45 days 


 before the local deadline to have the ballot count. Mr. 


 Eversole testified about the need for improvements in the 


 Federal Voting Assistance Program. Mr. Eversole strongly 


 advocated for military personnel to receive appropriate 


 voting information and voter registration materials when they 


 move or deploy to a new installation or port. In response to 


 a question I asked, Mr. Eversole also testified that certain 


 offices at the Department of Defense should be designed as 


 voter registration agencies under the National Voter 


 Registration Act.



 Robert Carey, executive director of the National Defense 


 Committee, testified about his own experience taking a leave 


 of absence from his duty as a member of the U.S. Navy 


 Reserves and flying back to New York City at his own expense 


 in order to vote in the 2004 election. He cited research 


 showing that only 26 percent of the ballots requested by 


 overseas soldiers in 2006 were successfully cast. Mr. Carey 


 emphasized that insufficient time was the chief reason for 


 these statistics, arguing that States too often send out 


 ballots too late for military voters to complete and return 


 them in time to be counted. He pointed to a study conducted 


 by the Pew Center on the States, Pew, which found that 23 


 States do not provide enough time for military and overseas 


 voters to successfully cast their ballots. Mr. Carey also 


 recommended that ballots be sent out at least 60 days before 


 they were due.



 Several organizations submitted statements for the hearing 


 record. Pew submitted a copy of its 2009 study of military 


 and overseas voting, No Time to Vote, for the committee 


 record. In its accompanying letter, Pew highlighted several 


 recommendations for reform from the study, including 


 ''sending out overseas absentee ballots sooner, eliminating 


 notary and witness requirements and harnessing technology to 


 allow for the electronic transmission of ballots and election 


 materials to voters overseas.''



 The Overseas Vote Foundation, OVF, submitted a copy of its 


 2008 post-election survey for the record. The survey included 


 data obtained from over 24,000 overseas voters and over 1,000 


 local election officials. Among OVF's key findings was that 


 more than half, 52 percent, of those overseas military voters 


 who tried but could not vote were unable to because their 


 ballots were late or did not arrive. OVF also found that 


 despite concerted efforts, less than half of UOCAVA voters 


 were aware of the Federal write-in absentee ballot.



 Democrats Abroad submitted a statement for the record 


 emphasizing the difficulties for military and overseas voters 


 stemming from the patchwork of varied State and local 


 regulations, a lack of awareness of the Federal write-in 


 absentee ballot, and general inability to effectively 


 communicate with local election officials from abroad.



 Tom Tarantino, legislative associate with Iraq and 


 Afghanistan Veterans of America, submitted a statement for 


 the record including testimony about his own experience as a 


 voting assistance officer, citing the lack of sufficient 


 training about how to effectively educate soldiers about 


 absentee balloting procedures. Mr. Tarantino recommended 


 improving the voting assistance officer program and suggested 


 that the Department of Defense be required to ensure safe and 


 timely passage of military ballots to their home districts.



 The Federation of American Women's Clubs Overseas submitted 


 a statement for the record in which it recommended that 


 States send overseas absentee ballots at least 45 days before 


 the deadline and that voter materials, including ballots, not 


 be rejected for reasons unrelated to voter eligibility.



 Everyone Counts submitted a ''white paper'' for the record 


 comparing the effectiveness of various voting technologies 


 for military and overseas voters.



 Alex Yasinac, dean of the School of Information and 


 Computer Sciences at the University of South Alabama, 


 submitted a statement for the record analyzing various 


 technological solutions to improve overseas absentee voting. 


 Dr. Yasinac suggested the creation of a technological pilot 


 program for overseas voters, including the use of virtual 


 private networks, cryptographic voting systems, and document 


 delivery upload systems to ensure secure electronic 


 transmission of balloting materials.














Introduction of the Bill




 I introduced S. 1415, the MOVE Act of 2009, on July 8, 


 2009, and was joined by Senators Saxby Chambliss and Ben 


 Nelson as original cosponsors. After the bill's introduction, 


 56 additional Senators joined as cosponsors. The bill was 


 referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.











 Committee Consideration at Markup




 S. 1415 was considered by the Senate Rules Committee at a 


 markup held on July 15, 2009. The committee adopted three 


 amendments which I submitted on behalf of Senator John 


 Cornyn, who had introduced separate legislation on improving 


 military voting that was pending at the time in the Rules 


 Committee. Senator Cornyn joined in this endeavor by 


 contributing his knowledge and expertise on military voting 


 to the MOVE Act. Senator Robert Bennett, ranking member of 


 the Rules Committee, introduced an amendment with several 


 provisions intent on improving the effectiveness of the MOVE 


 Act.



 The first amendment, which I submitted on behalf of Senator 


 Cornyn, strengthened the bill by ensuring that overseas 


 military personnel can mail their marked absentee ballots to 


 their local election offices with confidence that those 


 ballots will be received and counted by directing the 


 Presidential designee to work with the U.S. Postal Service to 


 provide expedited delivery services for ballots that are 


 collected before a prescribed deadline. The provision 


 provides ample discretion for the Presidential designee to 


 extend that deadline for collection of ballots, allowing the 


 Presidential designee to permit a longer transit time for 


 completed ballots to be delivered to local election 


 officials. To ensure Department of Defense accountability 


 under this section, the amendment directed the Presidential 


 designee to submit reports to the relevant congressional 


 committees to explain the procedures implemented to provide 


 the expedited mail delivery and inform the committees of the 


 number of military overseas ballots successfully and 


 unsuccessfully delivered to local election offices in time. 


 Finally, the amendment included language requiring the 


 Presidential designee to ensure, to the greatest extent 


 allowable, that the privacy of military servicemembers and 


 security of their ballots are protected during the delivery 


 process.



 The second amendment, which Senator Cornyn and I worked on 


 together, fortified the bill by expanding voter registration 


 opportunities, services, and information for military and 


 overseas voters. It also required the Department of Defense 


 to provide voting information and an opportunity for 


 servicemembers to register and update voting information 


 during certain points in service and provided the Secretary 


 of Defense flexibility to designate certain pay, personnel, 


 and identification offices as voter registration agencies. In 


 addition to voter registration, the amendment required 


 written information to be provided to servicemembers on 


 absentee ballot procedures. Finally, the amendment contained 


 reporting requirements for the Department of Defense to 


 evaluate its voter support services and send Congress its




 recommendations for improving those programs.



 The third amendment was technical in nature and altered no 


 substantive provisions of the bill.



 Ranking Member Bennett offered a package of amendments 


 modifying several provisions of the bill. First, the 


 amendment clarified that States may delegate the obligations 


 under the MOVE Act to local jurisdictions. Some local and 


 State election administrators contacted the Rules Committee 


 to express concern because they thought that the MOVE Act 


 could be interpreted to require States, instead of 


 localities, to take administrative responsibility for running 


 elections for UOCAVA voters. Though there was no intent to 


 shift routine administrative responsibility of elections to 


 States, for the sake of clarity in the bill, I supported this 


 amendment. While clarifying that the MOVE Act can be 


 administered and implemented at the local level, the 


 amendment did not modify or otherwise alter the ultimate 


 responsibility of MOVE Act compliance, which remains with the 


 State. Accordingly, States retain the responsibility to 


 ensure local jurisdictions' compliance with UOCAVA and MOVE 


 and thus the State will continue to be the focus of any 


 potential enforcement actions that need to be taken by the 


 Attorney General.



 Senator Bennett's amendments also modified provisions of 


 the MOVE Act which had originally required States to transmit 


 balloting materials ''by mail, electronically, or by 


 facsimile.'' The text of the amendment instead read to 


 require transmission of balloting materials ''by mail and 


 electronically.'' This change clarified the requirement on 


 State and local election administrators that, in addition to 


 mail, they must provide at least one method of fast and 


 effective electronic means of transmitting balloting 


 materials to U.S. citizens overseas and uniformed 


 servicemembers. It is important to note that Bob Carey during 


 his testimony before the Rules Committee on May 13, 2009, 


 testified that ''[R]ecent research by the National Defense 


 Committee indicates that fax transmission is not an effective 


 option for military personnel, especially those suffering the 


 greatest disenfranchisement in this process.'' However, at 


 the same time, the amendment's language clarified that 


 election administrators may provide multiple means of 


 electronic communication in order to ensure speedy 


 transmission of information, registration and balloting 


 materials.



 Senator Bennett's amendments also reinforced the privacy 


 and security provisions of the original legislation by 


 directing States to protect, to the extent practicable, the 


 integrity of the voter registration and absentee ballot 


 process through procedures that shield identity and personal 


 data.



 The amendments also simplified the timing provisions of the 


 original legislation by mandating that whenever a State 


 receives an absentee ballot request at least 45 days before a 


 Federal election it must send out an absentee ballot not 


 later than 45 days before the election. With respect to valid 


 ballot applications received after 45 days prior to such an 


 election, States are required to transmit a validly requested 


 absentee ballot in accordance with State law and as 


 expeditiously as possible. However, the amendment did not 


 impact the 30-day requirement under UOCAVA. At the same time, 


 the amendment removed language from the original version of 


 the bill which would have required States to accept and count 


 absentee ballots received up to 55 days after the date on 


 which an absentee ballot was transmitted or the date on which 


 the State certified an election, whichever was later. The 


 negotiated modification placed a 45-day mandate on States to 


 promptly respond to military and overseas absentee ballot 


 requests.



 The amendments also strengthened Department of Justice 


 oversight of absentee voting by uniformed services and 


 overseas voters by requiring the Presidential designee to 


 consult with the Attorney General before approving any 


 hardship exemptions from States unable to comply with the 


 bill's timing provisions. This will help ensure a unified 


 governmental response to State compliance with the MOVE Act.



 Finally, the amendments repealed subsections (a) through 


 (d) of Sec. 104 of the Uniformed and Overseas Absentee Voting 


 Act, which allowed military and overseas absentee ballot 


 applicants to indicate on their Federal Postcard Application 


 form that their application should be considered a continuing 


 application for an absentee ballot through the next two 


 regularly scheduled general elections. Given the highly 


 mobile nature of military and overseas voters, there was a 


 concern among States that this provision of UOCAVA required a 


 large number of ballots to be sent to old and outdated 


 addresses. Election officials reported receiving a large 


 number of these continuing absentee ballots as ''returned 


 undeliverable,'' thus artificially inflating the number of 


 failed ballots, and potentially wasting State resources. 


 Repealing these sections addressed those concerns. This 


 amended section does not prohibit States from providing 


 continuing applications for absentee ballots, or accepting 


 ballots received under such continuing applications. This 


 amended section also does not prohibit States from 


 considering a Federal Postcard Application submitted for a 


 primary election to carry over to the general election in 


 that same election cycle.



 The committee agreed to all of the proposed amendments and 


 adopted them by voice vote. The committee then voted to 


 report S. 1415, the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment 


 Act, as amended. The committee proceeded by voice vote, and 


 all members present became cosponsors of the legislation. S. 


 1415, as amended, was ordered reported to the Senate.





Passage by the Senate of the MOVE Act provisions in the DOD 













 authorization bill




 On July 22, 2009, I offered Senate amendment No. 1764 to S. 


 1390, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 


 2010, on the Senate Floor.



 Senator Cornyn spoke in support of this amendment that day:




 Our military servicemembers put their lives on the line to 


 protect our rights and our freedoms. Yet many of them still 


 face substantial roadblocks when it comes to something as 


 simple as casting their ballots and participating in our 


 national elections . . . This important amendment contains 


 many other commonsense reforms suggested by other Senators 


 and will help end the effective disenfranchisement of our 


 troops and their families. Our goal has been to balance 


 responsibilities between elections officials and the 


 Department of Defense, and I believe this amendment 


 accomplishes that goal.




 On July 23, 2009, I urged my colleagues to support the MOVE 


 Act amendment to the DOD authorization legislation:




 Now, if [our soldiers] can risk their lives for us we can 


 at least allow them to vote. They take orders from the 


 commander-in-chief. They are the first people who ought to be 


 allowed to elect and vote for a commander-in-chief. And if we 


 can deploy tanks and high-tech equipment and food to the 


 front lines, we can figure out a way to deliver ballots to 


 our troops so they can be returned and counted. And that, Mr. 


 President, is what the MOVE Act does.




 Senator Bennett spoke in support of the amendment:




 Now, then the legislation was introduced in its original 


 form, I raised concerns with Senator Schumer about some of 


 its provisions. He worked with me and my staff to address 


 these concerns and the amendment that we have before us today 


 effectively does so. That's why I'm pleased to now be a 


 cosponsor of the bill. The difficulties our service personnel 


 face in voting and the Senator from New York has described 


 them, and I believe this amendment deals with them in a 


 proper fashion.




 Senator Chambliss also spoke in support of the amendment:




 [N]ot since the passage of the Uniform and Overseas Voting 


 Act in 1986 have we proposed such significant legislation 


 designed to help the men and women of the military who time 


 and time again are called upon to defend the rights and 


 freedoms that we Americans hold so sacred. Unfortunately, our 


 military's one of the most disenfranchised voting blocs we 


 have and today we have the opportunity to correct this.




 Senator Nelson also added comments in support:




 We owe it to our men and women in uniform to protect their 


 right to vote. And for military and overseas votes, that 


 right is only as good as their ability to cast a ballot and 


 have it counted. For years, we have known of the obstacles 


 these brave Americans face in exercising their right to vote, 


 often when far from home and in harm's way. I firmly believe 


 this legislation will make a huge impact in empowering our 


 military and overseas voters to have their votes counted no 


 matter where they find themselves on election day.




 Senate amendment No. 1764 to S. 1390 was agreed to by voice 


 vote on July 23, 2009. The Senate took up H.R. 2647 on July 


 23, approved an amendment that substituted the text of S. 


 1390, then passed the bill by unanimous consent and requested 


 a conference with the House. A Senate-House conference was 


 held, and the House passed the conference report to H.R. 


 2647, H. Rept. 111-288, on October 8, 2009, and the Senate 


 passed it on October 22, 2009. H.R. 2647 was signed by the 


 President on October 28, 2009, and became Public Law 111-84.















 The MOVE Act Today




 The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act of 2009 is 


 a response to an unacceptable situation--the 


 disenfranchisement of Americans serving and living abroad who 


 are unable to vote because of logistical and geographic 


 barriers.



 The MOVE Act brings to an end a system that in the past 


 allowed a quarter of the ballots requested by U.S. troops to 


 go unreturned. It does so by insisting that every military 


 and overseas vote be counted. Congress recognized that those 


 who fight to defend America's freedom often face the greatest 


 obstacles in exercising their right to vote. Congress acted 


 to break down the challenges and barriers to voting faced by 


 these citizens with passage of the provisions of the Military 


 and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act.



 Most of the MOVE Act provisions will be in place for the 


 November 2010 general elections. States started implementing 


 measures and procedures to comply with the MOVE Act almost 


 immediately after passage of Public Law 111-84. At the 


 Federal level, the Department of Defense has been in 


 consultation with the Attorney General to develop and 


 promulgate regulations to administer the waiver process. As 


 the 2010 Federal election approaches, the States and the 


 Department of Defense are making every effort to




 ensure that military and overseas voters have every 


 opportunity to register, vote, and have their vote counted.


Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section of 
the MOVE Act provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2010 be printed in the Record.
