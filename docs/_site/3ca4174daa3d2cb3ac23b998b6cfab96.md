`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 27 February 2008`

Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, the question of the 
Iraq debate, once again at this particular juncture, was not the 
decision of the minority. Nevertheless, having put the Iraq issue back 
before the Senate, there are a number of members of my conference, many 
of whom have been to Iraq recently, who were anxious to discuss the 
undeniable progress that has occurred in Iraq over the last 6 months.

We had a good discussion yesterday. I have more members who would 
like to continue the discussion today. There is obviously an 
opportunity later in the morning or this afternoon to discuss further 
with the majority leader the possibility of shortening the time.

But for the moment, there are a number of Senators on my side of the 
aisle who are anxious to discuss the progress in Iraq, happy to have 
the debate time. Therefore, for the time being, I object.
