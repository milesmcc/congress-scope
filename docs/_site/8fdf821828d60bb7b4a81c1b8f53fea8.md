Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, last night the President did what he said 
he was going to do for weeks now. He vetoed the Democrat supplemental 
that was loaded with pork, tied the hands of our generals on the ground 
and provided the enemy with an ill-conceived exit strategy.

As the President said last night, Mr. Speaker, ''Congress passed a 
bill that substitutes the judgment of politicians for the judgment of 
our military commanders.'' I couldn't agree with him more, and that's 
why I opposed this supplemental, and that's exactly why he vetoed it.

We must not, as a nation, be invested in defeat. Again, I repeat, we 
must not, as a nation, be invested in defeat. Unilateral surrender may 
be the Democrats' plan, but it will not lead to a safer America.

Now that the veto has taken place, it is simply unacceptable for the 
Democrat leaders to delay any further the funding that our American 
troops deserve. Let's pass a clean Iraq supplemental.
