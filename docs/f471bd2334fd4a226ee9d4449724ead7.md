Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5975, to rename 
the post office in Waterville, New York in memory of Corporal John P. 
Sigsbee.

Mr. Speaker, it is with both incredible pride and sadness that I 
address the House today to speak on this bill that pays tribute to the 
life and sacrifice of one of this Nation's fallen soldiers, U.S. Army 
Corporal John Sigsbee.

On January 16, 2008, Corporal Sigsbee of Waterville, New York was 
killed in action 50 miles north of Baghdad during his second tour of 
duty in Iraq.



The family he left behind while in the line of duty will soon receive 
his second Military Purple Heart on his behalf. Corporal Sigsbee was 
only 21 years old when his life was taken in service of our country.

John Sigsbee graduated from Waterville Central School in 2004 and 
attended Mohawk Valley Community College. Upon completing his first 
year of college, John decided to join the U.S. Army to further finance 
his higher education and became wounded one month to the day during his 
first tour of duty in Iraq.

John was sent home to recover at the Brooke Army Medical Center, 
where he was visited by Army personnel who awarded him for his bravery. 
These officers told John that he needed time to heal properly from the 
burns he suffered when his tank drove over two IEDs, and that he needed 
time to consider his decision to return to service. However, John 
replied, with his mother at his side, ''Give me one year and I'll be 
back.'' John did just that, and it was then that his mother started to 
know what ''sacrifice'' truly means.

John went back and gave all that he had to give. In his mind, there 
was no question that his place was back with his fellow troops in Iraq 
to fulfill his responsibilities as a young American soldier.

Corporal Sigsbee valiantly served as a member of the 32nd Cavalry 
Unit in the 101st Airborne Division, a dedicated young man who every 
day honored his responsibility to his country and his mission. Corporal 
Sigsbee's purpose and sacrifices will be remembered by the entire 
village of Waterville, county of Oneida and now, with passage of this 
bill, by the whole Nation.

During calling hours and funeral arrangements for Corporal Sigsbee, 
his family and loved ones received an outpouring of gratitude and 
support by the village of Waterville. Over 2,000 citizens attended 
calling hours to pay their respects for this young American, and 300 
members from local veterans' organizations came to the local high 
school as a show of strength and unity for their fellow soldier. 
Additionally, a 50-car procession escorted his body from the Griffiss 
Airfield to Saratoga National Cemetery where he was laid to rest.

On that day, January 25, 2008, Corporal Sigsbee received a true 
hero's welcome from not only his family and friends, but from people 
who did not know him yet wanted to give their thanks, thanks to a man 
who paid the ultimate price for their safety and their freedom. The 
renaming of this post office may be considered by some as a simple act 
by Congress. But it will forever symbolize to the village of Waterville 
and the citizens of Oneida County, and to future generations, the deep 
appreciation that this legislative body has for this man's life and 
contributions, and for the actions of each and every member of our 
Armed Services.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support this legislation 
renaming the Waterville, New York, Post Office after and in honor of 
Corporal


John P. Sigsbee and to forever honor the life of this soldier, son, 
brother and American hero.
