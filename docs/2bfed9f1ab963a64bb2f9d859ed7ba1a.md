`Mr. REID â€” 30 June 2010`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, with 100,000 troops fighting on the front 
lines of our battle against terrorists in Afghanistan, the stakes could 
not be higher. That's why I was pleased that President Obama chose a 
proven leader for our forces in Afghanistan in GEN David Petraeus.

General Petraeus is the right choice to lead this mission in 
Afghanistan. He has demonstrated that he can effectively carry out a 
counterinsurgency strategy and prepare local forces to take over the 
U.S. combat mission.

The resounding bipartisan support that General Petraeus received in 
the Armed Services Committee and on the Senate floor sends the right 
message to our forces on the ground in Afghanistan, our allies who 
share our mission of defeating terrorism and the enemies who seek to 
harm us.

It says that we are committed to success in Afghanistan and we will 
continue to take the fight to the Taliban. And it also says that we 
will continue to work to transfer responsibility to Afghan forces--with 
the recognition that our commitment in Afghanistan is not open-ended.

As our Commander in Chief, President Obama must have a military and 
civilian team that has his full confidence, and with General Petraeus' 
confirmation, he now has that team in place.
