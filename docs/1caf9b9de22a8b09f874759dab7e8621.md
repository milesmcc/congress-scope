`Mr. CASTLE â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from 
North Carolina for yielding to me.

Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of the Iraq war, one of my foremost 
concerns has been the long-term stability of the Middle East, and the 
potential impact that chaos in this region could have on our security.

Our men and women in the United States military, among the hundreds 
of Delawarians, are doing extraordinary work under very complex and 
difficult


circumstances. We owe them an enormous debt of gratitude.

Notwithstanding the heroic efforts of our military personnel, the 
Iraqi Government has been unable to overcome the constant instability 
and sectarian violence that has marked much of the last 4 years. We 
have increased top levels in the past, including Fallujah in 2004, and 
Baghdad this past July, with mixed results.

Despite the incredible efforts of our brave solders, it is clear to 
me that an increase in American forces alone cannot resolve this 
conflict. Therefore, I will support this resolution, because I believe 
that the surge will be unsuccessful without a comprehensive diplomatic 
strategy to engage the international community and turn the 
responsibility over to the Iraqi Government.

That being said, I am disappointed that today's discussion has been 
structured in such a way that Members are limited solely to an up-or-
down vote on the troop increases. On Friday, after Congress passes this 
resolution, we will still lack the strategy necessary to stabilize the 
Middle East and bring our soldiers home.

This Congress owes the American people a truly complete and 
comprehensive discourse regarding our future in Iraq. The situation 
facing our soldiers is extremely complex, and it is unfortunate that 
the Democratic resolution fails to accurately reflect that reality.

In December, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group presented a 
comprehensive blueprint to achieve stability in the region and transfer 
responsibility over to the Iraqi Government, which I have in my hand 
and I went back and reread this week. I would encourage everyone to 
reread it.

In my opinion, one of the important recommendations made by the group 
was to call for a robust diplomatic effort to stabilize Iraq and ease 
tensions in the region. In fact, some of our Nation's greatest military 
minds, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell, have joined 
the group in recommending that every country with an interest in 
averting a chaotic Iraq, including all of Iraq's neighbors, Turkey, 
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Syria among them, participate in 
this important dialogue.

The group also recommended that we engage the United Nations Security 
Council, the European Union and other international institutions in 
launching this new diplomatic offensive. The intensive diplomacy 
recommended by the Iraq Study Group should be familiar to all of us who 
remember the Cold War.

One of the best examples of this approach to diplomacy was evident 
when a week after President Reagan asked General Secretary Gorbachev to 
''tear down this Wall,'' he sent his administration to Moscow for 
diplomatic talks.

The Iraq Study Group's recommendations are by no means a panacea. But 
their report does represent a new path forward, based on the pragmatic 
style of diplomacy that helped us win the Cold War.

For this reason, I have joined Congressman Frank Wolf and some of my 
colleagues in introducing legislation that endorses the Iraq Study 
Group's call for an integrated diplomatic initiative. In focusing on a 
true strategy for achieving stability in Iraq, this resolution seeks to 
improve our global standing and concentrate our efforts on funding an 
end game based on a genuine commitment to diplomacy.

To obtain these goals, the Wolf resolution seeks to lift our debate 
above the existing political rhetoric and pursue a comprehensive 
strategy to build regional and international support for stability in 
Iraq.

It is equally crucial that we do everything within our ability to 
accelerate the training of Iraqi troops and provide them with the 
resources necessary to assume control of their own destiny.

Mr. Speaker, as we speak, thousands of our Nation's bravest and 
brightest are risking their lives to serve our country in Iraq. 
Protecting American soldiers must continue to be our greatest priority. 
I will oppose any attempt to cut off funds for our troops who are 
serving in harm's way.

Therefore, it is crucial that we advance constructive strategies, 
such as those identified by the Iraq Study Group, to end the violence 
and bring our troops home to their families.
