`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 18 December 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if we want a Presidential signature on 
the Omnibus appropriations, thereby finishing our work this year, we 
need to defeat the Levin amendment and approve the McConnell amendment, 
which will come shortly after the Levin amendment. The McConnell 
amendment provides $70 billion for our troops, whether they are in 
Afghanistan or Iraq, without any strings attached, without any 
stipulations. The key to finishing our work this year successfully lies 
in defeating the Levin amendment and approving the McConnell amendment.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an explanatory statement 
be printed in the Record.
