U.S. Promises on Darfur Don't Match Actions













(By Michael Abramowitz)




 In April 2006, a small group of Darfur activists--including 


 evangelical Christians, the representative of a Jewish group 


 and a former Sudanese slave--was ushered into the Roosevelt 


 Room at the White House for a private meeting with President 


 Bush. It was the eve of a major rally on the National Mall, 


 and the president spent more than an hour holding forth, 


 displaying a kind of passion that has led some in the White 


 House to dub him the ''Sudan desk officer.''



 Bush insisted there must be consequences for rape and 


 murder, and he called for international troops on the ground 


 to protect innocent Darfuris, according to contemporaneous 


 notes by one of those present. He spoke of ''bringing 


 justice'' to the Janjaweed, the Arab militias that have 


 participated in atrocities that the president has repeatedly 


 described as nothing less than ''genocide.''



 ''He had an understanding of the issue that went beyond 


 simply responding to a briefing that had been given,'' said 


 David Rubenstein, a participant who was then executive 


 director of the Save Darfur Coalition, which has been sharply 


 critical of the administration's response to the crisis. ''He 


 knew more facts than I expected him to know, and he had a 


 broader political perspective than I expected him to have.''



 Yet a year and a half later, the situation on the ground in 


 Darfur is little changed: More than 2 million displaced 


 Darfuris, including hundreds of thousands in camps, have been 


 unable to return to their homes. The perpetrators of the 


 worst atrocities remain unpunished. Despite a renewed U.N. 


 push, the international peacekeeping troops that Bush has 


 long been seeking have yet to materialize.



 Just this weekend, peace talks in Libya aimed at ending the 


 four-year conflict appeared to be foundering because of a 


 boycott by key rebel groups.



 Many of those who have tracked the conflict over the years, 


 including some in his own administration, say Bush has not 


 matched his words with action, allowing initiatives to drop 


 because of inertia or failure to follow up, while proving 


 unable to mobilize either his bureaucracy or the 


 international community.



 The president who famously promised not to allow another 


 Rwanda-style mass murder on his watch has never fully chosen 


 between those inside his government advocating more pressure 


 on Sudan and those advocating engagement with its Islamist 


 government, so the policy has veered from one approach to 


 another.



 Meanwhile, a constant turnover of key administration 


 advisers on Darfur, such as former deputy secretary of state 


 Robert B. Zoellick and presidential aide Michael Gerson, has 


 made it hard for the administration to maintain focus.



 ''Bush probably does want something done, but the lack of 


 hands-on follow-up from this White House allowed this to 


 drift,'' said one former State Department official involved 


 in Darfur who did not want to be quoted by name criticizing 


 the president. ''If he says, 'There is not going to be 


 genocide on my watch,' and then 2/1/2/ years later we are 


 just getting tough action, what gives? He has made 


 statements, but his administration has not given meaning to 


 those statements.''



 Since the United States became the first and only 


 government to call the killing in Darfur genocide, Bush and 


 his aides have grappled with how to provide security for 


 civilians in a large, remote area in the heart of Africa.



 While almost everyone involved in Darfur policy agrees that 


 an African Union peacekeeping force of just 7,000 troops is 


 not up to the task, the United States has refused to send 


 troops and, despite promises of reinforcements, has yet to 


 secure many additional troops from other countries. At the 


 same time, it has been unable to broker a diplomatic 


 resolution that might ease the violence.



 Even Bush has complained privately that his hands are tied 


 on Darfur because, with the U.S. involvement in Iraq and 


 Afghanistan, he cannot be seen as ''invading another Muslim 


 country,'' according to people who have spoken with him about 


 the issue.



 ''It's impossible to keep Iraq out of this picture,'' said 


 Edward Mortimer, who served as a top aide to then-U.N. 


 Secretary General Kofi Annan and says resentment over Iraq 


 caused many countries to not want to cooperate with the 


 United States on Darfur.



 Bush advisers argue that the lack of success reflects the 


 limitations of working through institutions such as the 


 United Nations, NATO and the African Union. They cite the 


 billions of dollars of U.S. relief aid that has kept millions 


 of Sudanese alive. They say U.S. pressure has kept the issue 


 on the world's agenda.



 ''If there was ever a case study where the president sees 


 the limitations and frustrations of the multilateral 


 organizations, it is the issue of Darfur,'' said Dan 


 Bartlett, former White House counselor. ''Everybody for the 


 most part can come to a consensus: Whether you call it 


 genocide or not, we have an urgent security and humanitarian 


 crisis on our hands. Yet these institutions cannot garner the 


 will or ability to come together to save people.''



 There is no doubt that responsibility for inaction on 


 Darfur can be spread around. The Sudanese government has 


 resisted cooperation at every step in the saga and has been 


 shielded at the United Nations by China, its main 


 international protector. Few other Western nations, with the 


 notable exception of Britain and some Nordic countries, have 


 shown much interest in resolving the crisis. The process of 


 raising peacekeepers from U.N. members has proved tortuously 


 slow.



 ''There's an enormous stain on the world's conscience,'' 


 said Mitchell B. Reiss, former State Department policy 


 planning chief. ''We collectively stood by and let it happen 


 a decade after it happened in Rwanda.''














 A President's Passion




 In late 2005, Bush gathered his most senior advisers to 


 discuss what to do about Darfur. He wanted to know whether 


 the U.S. military could send in helicopter gunships to attack 


 the militias if they launched new attacks on the refugee 


 camps. Could they also shoot down Sudanese military aircraft 


 if necessary? he asked. His aides worried that the United 


 States could get involved in another shooting war, and the 


 president backed off.



 ''He wanted militant action, and people had to restrain 


 him,'' said one senior official familiar with the episode. 


 ''He wanted to go in and kill the Janjaweed.''



 The meeting underscored both Bush's personal investment in 


 Sudan, dating back to the beginning of his administration, 


 and his instinct, which aides have kept in check, to take 


 direct action.



 Many close to Bush believe that this intense interest in 


 the issue was heavily influenced by American evangelicals, 


 who have adopted the cause of Christians in southern Sudan. 


 Even before the crisis in Darfur, in western Sudan, one of 


 Bush's foreign policy goals was to try to end the civil war 


 between the Muslim government in Khartoum and rebels in the 


 south, a conflict that had lasted more than two decades and 


 cost more than 2 million lives.



 Former Senator John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), whom Bush 


 appointed as his special envoy for Sudan, said the 


 president's interest in the country is rooted in a larger 


 sense of morality. ''This isn't a country that has much 


 strategic interest for the United States,'' he observed.



 Bush's initiative to broker a north-south deal worked. 


 Despite difficult negotiations, Sudanese President Omar 


 Hassan al-Bashir agreed in January 2005 to a plan to share 


 power and oil revenues with the rebels--and even gave the 


 south the right to secede in six years if the leadership 


 could not reconcile their differences.



 But by then a separate conflict had exploded in Darfur, as 


 long-standing conflicts between African farmers and Arab 


 herders over land, and a failure by the Khartoum government 


 to redress local grievances, boiled over into armed 


 rebellion.



 The government turned to a tactic it had employed in 


 fighting the southern rebels: arming local Arab militias, the 


 Janjaweed, to carry out a counterinsurgency on its behalf. 


 The militias rampaged throughout Darfur starting in mid-2003, 


 burning hundreds of villages, raping women and summarily 


 executing African villagers, according to numerous human 


 rights reports. More than 200,000 people have died in Darfur 


 since the crisis erupted, according to U.N. estimates. Some 


 estimates place the figure as high as 450,000.



 Many familiar with Sudan believe that Bush and his aides 


 initially averted their gaze to the flaring violence in 


 Darfur because raising the issue might interfere with the 


 difficult negotiations with Bashir. Some U.S. officials saw 


 another reason for the reluctance to get involved: preserving 


 a burgeoning intelligence relationship with Khartoum, which 


 had begun sharing critical information about al-Qaeda and 


 other Islamic extremists.



 ''There was a tendency not to see Darfur initially for what 


 it was,'' said Gerard Gallucci, who served in 2003 and 2004 


 as the top U.S. diplomat in Khartoum. It was well known among 


 Western governments, he said, that Sudan ''was using terror 


 to cleanse black Muslim Africans from land that they had 


 promised the Janjaweed.''



 Such claims are vigorously contested by Danforth and other 


 Bush advisers, who say the president repeatedly warned Bashir 


 about the consequences of sending Arab militias after 


 defenseless civilians.



 Over time, Bush has become increasingly outspoken about the 


 situation in Darfur, raising the issue with foreign leaders 


 and meeting privately with dissidents and other little-known 


 political players in Sudan to encourage a solution. In recent 


 months, he has singled out Bashir for harsh condemnation, 


 accusing him of subverting efforts to bring peace to Darfur.





 Meeting with the Darfur activists, Bush acknowledged that 


 Sudan had cooperated in anti-terrorism initiatives--but he 


 insisted that Khartoum could not ''buy off'' the United 


 States, Rubenstein said.



 Last spring, when the White House worked on a new plan to 


 try to press Sudan's government to accept international 


 peacekeepers, it was the president himself who was the 


 driving force in the interagency process, many officials 


 involved the debate said. According to national security 


 adviser Stephen J. Hadley, Bush refused to accept a program 


 developed to confront Sudan because he was concerned that it 


 was not tough enough. He kicked it back to the bureaucracy.



 ''I've had it with this incrementalism,'' Hadley quoted the 


 president as saying in the Oval Office. ''We're going to 


 lead, and if people don't want to follow us, they're going to 


 have to stand up and explain why they are willing to let 


 women continue to be raped in Darfur.''



 At one point, one senior official said, Bush wanted action 


 to crimp Sudan's booming oil business, a move that would have 


 severely aggravated relations with China--and that no one 


 else in the government favored.



 There was stunned silence in the room, the official said, 


 when Hadley disclosed Bush's idea to other government 


 officials. Hadley made clear he was not interested in having 


 a discussion, but the administration never went as far as the 


 president seemed to be demanding. Instead, Treasury officials 


 came up with a sanctions plan aimed at tracking and squeezing 


 key individuals and companies in the Sudanese economy, 


 including the oil business.

I want to thank the gentlewoman from California, my good friend 
Barbara Lee, for her leadership on so many issues. As we come to the 
floor tonight, I want to thank her for her work that she has done in 
Darfur and thank her for joining me again in this hour.

As has been said previously, there were three pieces of legislation 
on Darfur that were voted on on the floor today, and one of those 
resolutions happened to be a resolution authored by my colleague and 
good friend Sheila Jackson-Lee from the great State of Texas.

She has had many great opportunities to take the lead on some of 
these issues as well. I have to say she and Barbara Lee have been 
wonderful about helping me with this CBC message hour every week.

I am happy to yield to my colleague and good friend Sheila Jackson-
Lee of Houston, Texas.
