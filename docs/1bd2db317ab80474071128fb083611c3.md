Mr. SHAYS. I thank the gentleman for making this point. The bottom 
line is: In this Chamber, only 69 Members voted against having the Iraq 
Study Group revisit Iraq so they could come out with a report that 
could complement, either agree with or disagree with, what General 
Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are going to conclude.

It seems to me it would be in the best interest of both Republicans 
and Democrats to find areas where we can agree, where we can work 
together. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this Democratic 
Congress is opposed to bringing the Iraq Study Group up for a vote.
