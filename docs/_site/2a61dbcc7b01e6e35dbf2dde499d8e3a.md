Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Lois 
Capps and Eddie Bernice Johnson for bringing this forward on H. Res. 
1086, recognizing National Nurses Week.

I have spent over 30 years as a nurse, and it was mentioned earlier, 
someone said, Once a nurse. Well, let me say, Once a nurse, always a 
nurse. We carry our duties even here to the House of Representatives.

I sit on the Education Committee, and what I have been working on 
since I came here was making sure that our nurses get every opportunity 
to increase our numbers. As has been mentioned before by both of my 
colleagues, the nursing shortage in this country is of a crisis 
proportion. We see that our nurses today are a lot older; they're at 
the retirement age, and we must do everything that we can to make sure 
that we have our young people coming into a very, very rewarding 
career. Nursing can be demanding, it can be tiring, it can be 
physically draining; but it couldn't be a better career.

When I first joined nursing over 30 years ago, I worked in the 
intensive care unit, and I spent most of my life there and just to be 
able to help a patient in their greatest need but also to work with 
their families to comfort them as they saw their loved one going 
through a traumatic injury.

We need to make sure that this country has a supply of nurses 
continuously. We have many young people that want to go to nursing 
school, but what we have found over the years is we don't have enough 
professors to be able to teach them to be nurses. So in the Higher 
Education Act, there is going to be funding in there to make sure that 
those that want to go into a higher education to be able to teach 
nursing, it can work out for us.

When we look at the future, we're seeing today in our hospitals such 
a shortage of nurses that a lot of the nurses are doing a lot of 
overtime. When they take a day off, they're always called to come back 
in. That is not acceptable, mainly because you have to be totally alert 
at all times. And I certainly tip my hat to my fellow nurses that go 
through this every single day.

They stay in the profession because they love the profession. They 
stay in the profession because it is a calling. Not everyone can be a 
nurse. It is a calling. I salute those men and women that go into 
nursing, and I also salute the women and men that are fighting in Iraq 
and Afghanistan and taking their nursing care to the soldiers and 
giving them comfort when they need it. There is no greater, in my 
opinion, profession than to be a nurse.

With that being said, I hope my colleagues will support H. Res. 1086 
and recognize National Nurses Week.
