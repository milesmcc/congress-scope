Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Guard and in 
celebration of their 371 years of service. I would like to thank my 
colleague from Florida, Ginny Brown-Waite, for bringing this measure to 
the floor.

In my State of New Hampshire, the first citizen militia formed in 
1623 with the settlement of Portsmouth. In 1679, the New Hampshire 
National Guard was formally established, marking the humble beginnings 
of my State's storied tradition of service.

Today, nearly 2,700 men and women continue that same tradition of 
service in the New Hampshire National Guard, and they, too, are 
distinguishing themselves on the battlefield and at home.

In New Hampshire, our Guardsmen routinely perform search and rescue 
operations. They respond to floods and to ice storms that threaten the 
region each year. And the New Hampshire Guard joined many other States 
that answered the call to aid victims from Hurricane Katrina.

This story of selfless sacrifice is not unique to the members of New 
Hampshire's National Guard, but it is one example of how all National 
Guardsmen put others before self, and their service and sacrifice is 
honored here in this bill.

Today, over 30,000 Guardsmen are serving on the ground and in the 
skies over Iraq and Afghanistan. As we celebrate the National Guard for 
its 371 years of service, our thoughts are with those men and women who 
continue to serve bravely overseas and with their families back home. 
And our hearts are heavy remembering the 483 Army and Air Guardsmen 
that have given their last great measure of devotion. For them we vow 
to care for their families and honor their sacrifice.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
