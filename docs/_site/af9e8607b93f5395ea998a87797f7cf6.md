Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
resolution. I join my colleagues in celebrating the amazing life and 
accomplishments of Mahatma Gandhi. Through his fearless leadership in 
promoting civil rights and justice for the people of India, he 
demonstrated the power of non-violent civil disobedience to effect 
change. He has contributed immeasurably to the legacy of peace.

While I wholeheartedly support this resolution, the best way for this 
body to recognize Gandhi's accomplishments is to stop funding the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Stability in Iraq and Afghanistan cannot be achieved as long as war 
and occupation are the tools with which we purport to build peace. When 
the U.S. kills innocent civilians and destroys families, homes and 
communities, the results often incite fear and rage. After more than 8 
years of war in Afghanistan and more than 6 years of war in Iraq it is 
clear that lasting peace and stability cannot emerge from such 
beginnings.

Rather, stability is best fomented through the seeds of peace such as 
upholding human rights, promoting social and economic justice, and 
ensuring education, employment and access to basic goods and services. 
Regrettably, the billions of dollars of funding that this body has 
dedicated to the wars have devastated Iraq and Afghanistan. If this 
body wants to see peace and stability in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. 
must stop engaging in policies of aggression.

I strongly support this bill, the powerful accomplishments of the 
great Mahatma Gandhi, and urge my colleagues to honor his vision.
