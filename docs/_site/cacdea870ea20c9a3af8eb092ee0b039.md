`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I was remiss before in not 
commending the gentleman from New Jersey on his knowledge of logic and 
philosophy. I should have known he would get us on that one.

With that, I also note that the Iraq Study Group said that the United 
States should significantly increase the number of U.S. military 
personnel, including combat troops.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman 
from Indiana, a member of the Homeland Security Committee (Mr. Souder).
