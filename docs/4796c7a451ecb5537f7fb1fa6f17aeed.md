`Mr. LEWIS of California â€” 1 July 2010`

Mr. LEWIS of California. I rise to oppose the Lee amendment to 
essentially cut off the funding for our troops in Afghanistan.

I am very proud to yield 5 minutes to my colleague, our leader on the 
Defense Subcommittee, the gentleman from Florida, Bill Young.
