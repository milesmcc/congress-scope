`Mr. FORTENBERRY â€” 15 September 2010`

Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, he was called ''a young man of 
integrity and respect,'' ''a great marine who loved the Marine Corps,'' 
''a loving husband and father.'' This is how the late Staff Sergeant 
Michael A. Bock was remembered by those who knew him.

Staff Sergeant Bock was conducting combat operations in the Helmand 
province in Afghanistan when his patrol came under fire. He died from 
those injuries on August 13. He had served four deployments in both 
Iraq and Afghanistan and was awarded the Purple Heart, the Navy and 
Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and the Combat Action Ribbon.

He was raised in Springfield, Nebraska, and attended Elkhorn's Mount 
Michael High School, where he met his future wife, Tiffany. Tiffany and 
Michael also had a 3-year-old son, Zander. Zander's birth, Michael 
said, was the happiest moment of his life. While in Afghanistan, he 
watched online as his son blew out three birthday candles; and for 
Valentine's Day, he recorded a message and sent it to his young son. 
Now I'm certain that Zander will always carry his father's voice in his 
heart.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I offer my condolences 
to the Bock family. May God bless Staff Sergeant Bock and grant eternal 
life unto him.
