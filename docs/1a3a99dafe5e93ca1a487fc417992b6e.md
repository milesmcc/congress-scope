Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in 
consideration of H.R. 514, legislation naming a postal facility in 
Brooksville, Florida, after Sergeant Lea Robert Mills of the United 
States Marine Corps.

Sergeant Mills was killed April 28, 2006, while conducting combat 
operations against enemy forces in Al Anbar Province, Iraq. He was 21 
years old. A native of Masarkytown, Florida, Sergeant Mills joined the 
Marines in 2002 after graduating from Hernando High School. After his 
initial service, he renewed his commitment to the Marines and 
volunteered to serve his country in Iraq.

He spent only 6 weeks in that country before an improvised explosive 
device took his life. Sergeant Mills is survived by his wife, Keesha, 
his parents, Rob and Delores, and his brother, Parker. This young man's 
death is a tragedy for our Nation and for all those who loved him, but 
his sacrifice is a triumph of human courage and selflessness. Sergeant 
Mills is due the gratitude and remembrance of his country and its 
people.

I urge the swift passage of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
