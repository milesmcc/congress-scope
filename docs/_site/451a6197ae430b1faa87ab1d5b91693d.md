Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No, I'm sorry. The gentleman does not 
seem to understand the rules. I'm giving you a lot more of my time. 
Well, I guess free speech that we put in is for other countries.

Look, I understand the thought. The minority thought they came up 
with a clever idea and they outsmarted themselves. They put language in 
here that I think would interfere with the ability to have economic 
relations with Iraq. And apparently what I'm being told is if you 
believe that the Government of Iraq has no business interests with 
Iran, then you can vote for this bill and not worry about Iraq.

I yield back the balance of my time.
