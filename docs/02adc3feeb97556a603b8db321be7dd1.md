Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, over the break I had the opportunity to 
travel to Iraq to meet with our troops and military commanders on the 
ground there.

Two observations: the morale of our troops is high, and the surge is 
working. General Petraeus has crafted a highly sophisticated 
counterinsurgency strategy that has put the terrorists on


the defensive and brought some level of security to many Iraqi 
communities where there had been none before.

Now I know it's hard to admit when you are wrong, but there are many 
in this Chamber who came to this floor and opposed the surge saying it 
would be a failure. Well, it hasn't been. It has been a success. In 
fact, even the United Nations is recognizing the success of the 
Petraeus strategy. The U.N.'s top envoy in Iraq acknowledged the 
improvements in security and even tentative steps towards national 
reconciliation this week.

Even for the war's opponents, it is now time to admit the success of 
the surge strategy in Iraq. But, instead of honoring the great work of 
our troops, all I hear is silence.
