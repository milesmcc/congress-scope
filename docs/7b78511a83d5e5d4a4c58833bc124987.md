Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I would just point out to my good friend 
from Virginia that these translators did risk their lives to help our 
troops in Iraq. If they stayed in Iraq, they would in all likelihood be 
killed. The reason they come here is to escape assassination.

With that, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the distinguished chairman of the committee.
