Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to express my sympathy over the 
loss of U.S. Army SPC Justin Pellerin, a 21-year-old resident of 
Concord, NH. Specialist Pellerin was killed while conducting combat 
operations in Wardak Province, Afghanistan, on August 20, 2009.

Specialist Pellerin was a 2006 graduate of Concord High School. It 
was there that he met Chelsea, his high school sweetheart, whom he 
would later marry. The two had just celebrated their 1-year anniversary 
and were looking forward to Justin returning home in December. His 
family and friends remember him for his sharp sense of humor, his 
selflessness, and his love of American muscle cars.

Justin joined the Army because he wanted to make a difference in the 
world. For his distinguished service, he has been awarded the Bronze 
Star, the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal and the National Defense 
Service Medal. He, and the thousands of brave men and women of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, represent the best in America's long tradition of duty, 
sacrifice, and service.

In addition to his wife Chelsea, Specialist Pellerin is survived by 
his mother Melissa; stepfather Dale Farmer; and two younger sisters 
Molly and Hannah. He will be missed dearly by all those who knew him.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring the life 
of SPC Justin Pellerin.
