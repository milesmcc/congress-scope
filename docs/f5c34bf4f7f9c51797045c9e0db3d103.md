Mrs. TAUSCHER. Well, yielding myself some time, I don't disagree with 
you, but one recommendation out of some 70-odd does not make the Iraq 
Study Group what the President is doing.

Mr. Speaker, at this time I am going to yield myself 25 minutes, and 
at this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois, the 
chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, Mr. Costello.
