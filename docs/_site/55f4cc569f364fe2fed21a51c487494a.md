Mr. HUNTER. I will just tell the gentleman, in the MOSs that our 
folks sign up for, especially the aerial supportive MOSs, that is 
always out there, that they are going to have to go, because where the 
armed services go, where the active folks go, let me just finish my 
answer to the gentleman. He asked me a question. I am going to ask 
answer it.

If you are in a supportive service that involves things likes aerial 
refueling, C-130 work, which is the workhorse of the U.S. military, you 
understand when you go in, you are going to be making probably multiple 
tours. If you join the U.S. Marines right now, the recruiter tells you 
as you sign up, you can be guaranteed that you will go to Iraq.

I would say to the gentleman another thing: Knowing those things, we 
are meeting all of our enlistment goals in the Guard and Reserve. So 
the active duty people who are undertaking multiple tours are coming 
back and reenlisting. And knowing that, knowing that you are exposed to 
multiple tours, we have more people signing up for the Guard, for the 
Reserve.

And interestingly, I will tell the gentleman, the place where we have 
had problems with recruiting in the last year from the information I 
have seen is the Naval Reserve, which doesn't do tours in Iraq. But the 
combat arms have multiple tours.
