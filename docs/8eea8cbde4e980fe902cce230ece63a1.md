Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the Senator is exactly right. And I 
will add one other point to his very prescient comments. Let us say we 
have this surge and then troops leave after a certain amount of time--
some say the end of the summer, some say it will go on 3, 4, 5 years. 
What is going to happen then if we don't have a political solution the 
good Senator asks about? The Sunni and Shia will resume fighting, and 
we will have accomplished nothing. We will have seen the lives of some 
of our brave men and women be taken from them, American soldiers. We 
will have created more havoc in Iraq. And we will have, again, delayed 
the very political solution my friend from Massachusetts talks about, 
which is essential.

If there had been a change in Government, if there had been a change 
in strategy, perhaps--I can't say because I don't know what it would 
be, given this administration hasn't changed anything--maybe the 
American people, maybe some on this side of the aisle would say: Give 
it a chance. But to send more of our brave troops over there when there 
is no change in strategy, when it is just increasing policing of a 
civil war, and when, at the end of this so-called surge, this 
escalation, nothing will have changed, the American people have every 
right to ask: To what end?

That is what we are asking. That is why we want a simple vote. And 
that is why today is going to go down in history as a day when this 
Republican minority in this House said to the President: We are 
supporting your surge. We don't want to vote on it, but we are allowing 
it to happen. We are encouraging it to happen. And the very rubberstamp 
nature, when the minority was in the majority, that brought them to 
such trouble in November of 2006 is simply continuing.
