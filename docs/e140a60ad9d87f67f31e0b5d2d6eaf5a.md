Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, we must begin to think differently in America 
and join hands across the aisle. Our Nation must become secure now, not 
next week; and that is why I rise in support of H.R. 1.

As other Members have, I ask the current administration to present 
this Congress with a comprehensive plan for Iraq, a plan that makes 
sense, a plan based on the realities on the ground in Iraq and in the 
region, for all of us have the same goal: to build a better and more 
secure Nation.

By working together, we will accomplish our shared mission, first, by 
implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission; secondly, by 
securing our borders; and, finally, by protecting our Nation from 
threats from nuclear warfare.

Please join me in supporting H.R. 1 as we begin to work together to 
build a better Nation and a more secure Nation for everyone.
