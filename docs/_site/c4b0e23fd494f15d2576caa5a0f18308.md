Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for 
the very kind words they have given about this great piece of 
legislation, this resolution.

I think it is very, very important, Mr. Speaker, that we come 
together as a country and celebrate the contributions of other 
countries and the roles that they played in assisting us not only with 
our independence but making it concrete.

Mr. Speaker, as we look at House Resolution 909, I want to give my 
sincere thanks to the Committee on Foreign Affairs for bringing this 
resolution to the floor, and especially shed light on Chairman Lantos 
for his forward-leaning and making sure that this resolution made it 
through the process. And he will be forever missed here in this body. 
And hopefully his memory will continue on, not only on the committee, 
but here in Congress.

I think it is also important that we pause to not only thank staff 
but also thank Haitian Americans throughout this country that have 
fought very hard on behalf of this country, not only in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and other theaters, but have contributed in many other 
areas. And that is where this bill came about.

The Haitian American Historical Society in Miami, Florida, moved 
forth with a monument in Savannah of the great battle, and I had an 
opportunity to go there recently. And there are a number of Haitians 
and those that care about the well-being of Haiti that wanted to make 
sure that the contributions of these soldiers were recognized in a way 
that will be able to allow not only this generation but future 
generations to understand Haiti's contributions.

When you start talking about 500 freed Haitian slaves traveling to 
Savannah, Georgia, to be a part of a multinational force to fight on 
behalf of this country against the Brits at that particular time, and 
to be in the same city where you had people who look like me that were 
enslaved, and traveling to Savannah is a very moving experience for 
every American, because so many battles have taken place there and it 
is such a historical and beautiful city that you can't help but pause 
to think about the courage.

So for us to be on the floor, Mr. Speaker and Members, to not only 
talk but to pass, hopefully, this resolution will be the first time in 
the history of the Republic that we have actually said thank you to 
Haiti, that we have said thank you to the families of the 300 to 500 
troops that actually traveled to Savannah to fight on our behalf. I 
don't believe it is too late, but I think that it is very appropriate 
for us to be on the floor and allow the Members to show their 
appreciation for their contributions.



As we celebrate not only the contributions of these soldiers but we 
also shed light with our Members and Americans about the contributions 
that Haitians have made, I think, as we look at this debate and we look 
at what we are doing for Haiti right now, we must bring Americans up to 
speed on the history. The fact that these freed slaves came to Savannah 
and fought, and the fact that Haiti was one of the first countries to 
denounce slavery and to fight for their own independence, to fight 
Napoleon that pushed him to carry out the Louisiana Purchase with the 
United States of America, these Haitian fighters traveled throughout 
the Western Hemisphere and played a very strong role in allowing the 
United States to be who we are.

So when we start talking about assistance for Haiti, it is not like 
it is a one-way street; it is a two-way street. And I am proud to 
represent a constituency where we have more Haitians than anywhere else 
in the United States of America, but Haitians throughout the diaspora, 
this will be a very proud day for them; and I believe it will be a very 
proud day for them when we vote in the affirmative.

When we look at the contributions of Mr. Henry Christopher who fought 
in the American Revolutionary War, to use his experience from the first 
free government in the Western Hemisphere, and when we look at what the 
Haitian Americans Historical Society has spent a number of years to be 
able to not only bring the Haitian American history to the Congress but 
to also bring to everyday Americans, I think it is very, very 
important, Mr. Speaker, that Members share with their constituency the 
contribution of these great men, and to be able to make sure that we 
share the history of all communities that have come to this country to 
make us strong.

Once again, I want to thank the committee, and I want to also thank 
the staff that has worked very hard on it. I know that we have other 
Members that want to speak in affirming the passage of this 
legislation. But I am personally moved because I represent a number of 
individuals that, when we look at immigration policy, when we look at 
aid to Haiti, when we look at our interventions when coups have taken 
place in Haiti, as recent as the 82nd Airborne, when we look at those 
in the State Department that serve within the Foreign Service and the 
conditions that they have to work under, when we also look at the Peace 
Corps and other organizations like it, religious institutions, a number 
of NGOs, that we call nongovernmental organizations, and what they do 
and where they live in the rural parts of Haiti, providing not only 
education and food; when we look at their contributions and we look at 
the conditions they have to work under now as Haiti struggles with 
natural disasters and struggles with hard economic times, this 
legislation will help enshrine not only the contributions of Haitians 
towards the United States, but also Americans returning not only the 
favor but the goodwill back to the great country of Haiti.

With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members to vote in the affirmative 
on House Resolution 909.
