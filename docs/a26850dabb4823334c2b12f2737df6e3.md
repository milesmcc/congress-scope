Mr. HODES. It is a fair thing for the American people to expect 
competence from their government. They expect us to manage their money 
well, to manage it wisely, to be smart and be prudent and to be 
basically competent. That is one of the things that an effective 
government does.

When you think about some of the ways that our government has 
unfortunately mismanaged the effort in Iraq, the imagination cannot 
even keep up with what kinds of things have gone on.

Here are a couple of things. We know that the Bush administration has 
tragically mismanaged the war. The money we have spent on contracting 
has just been like throwing it out the window because we have had 
contracts upon contracts and subcontracts, nobody knows where the money 
has gone. Somebody is making a lot of money in Iraq. It was a free-for-
all from the beginning with no-bid contracts, contractors piled on top 
of each other, and millions and billions of dollars.

We heard in one of our hearings in the Oversight Committee how we 
shipped $12 billion in cash over to Iraq during the early days of the 
occupation. The money was just given away to the ministries in Iraq and 
spent without any kind of accountability. And there have been how many 
prosecutions for war profiteering? Very few.

Luckily, our Congress in the past few days has enacted the War 
Profiteering Act, and we hope that will mean some real accountability. 
But there are billions unaccounted for. We have spent more than $50 
billion on U.S. contractors for relief and reconstruction activities in 
Iraq alone; yet we heard in our hearings how these contractors who were 
being paid millions and billions of dollars weren't getting the jobs 
done. Things were left unfinished. The money was being wasted, and with 
all that, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction had a 
report recently. He said that the Coalition Provisional Authority in 
Iraq, that was the government that we set up under Mr. Bremer, who is a 
good friend of the President, we set up this Coalition Provisional 
Authority. He said, I am the ruler of everything, I'm running the show. 
He ran the show. They can't account for $8.8 billion. I will say it 
again: They can't account for $8.8 billion.

If you look at what that involves, that is about the money to insure 
over 8 million kids under SCHIP, $8.8 billion. That is about the 
equivalent that it means. Gone, unaccounted for, can't figure it out. 
That is not competent management.

Take the issue of Blackwater that we have dealt with in hearings the 
other day. We found out that this company, Blackwater, which is 
providing security in Iraq and which now is under question for a 
terrible incident in which many Iraq civilians seem to have been gunned 
down, it is now being investigated by the FBI. Well, Blackwater is 
charging the government $1,222 a day for the services of a private 
military contractor. Each person they have got, $1,222 a day. That is 
$445,000 a year for each of these security guards, and that is over six 
times what we pay an equivalent U.S. soldier.

When we heard that during the hearing, we sat there stunned. We 
scratched our heads. We brought in the State Department and asked them 
what they knew about it. They couldn't give us any good answers. They 
were being


guarded by these guys at these exorbitant costs, but they were not 
willing to talk to us. They weren't able to talk to us and couldn't 
give us any answers. We wanted to know why shouldn't we have U.S. 
soldiers perform these duties at a much lower cost.

Now, one of the things that we expect from our government is 
competent management. We certainly haven't gotten it in this effort in 
Iraq, and we want to make sure that our kids are covered. We have 
incompetent management in Iraq, or are we going to cover our kids. 
Those are the kinds of choices that we are facing. They are pretty 
basic choices.
