`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 14 December 2010`

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday America lost one of the 
most talented and dedicated diplomats it has ever produced. Richard 
Holbrooke began his diplomatic service several decades ago as a young 
foreign service officer in Vietnam. The storied career that followed 
spanned the globe and will remain an integral part of the diplomatic 
history of our Nation.

Dick Holbrooke will always be remembered for pursuing the hardest 
missions, whether negotiating the Dayton Accords which helped end the 
war in Bosnia or his immensely difficult final assignment as Special 
Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Ambassador Holbrooke 
doggedly pursued what in his view best enhanced the diplomacy and 
national security objectives of our Nation. We honor his legacy of 
service to America's foreign policy interests by continuing his efforts 
to help Afghanistan deny the Taliban a return to power and to disrupt, 
defeat, and dismantle al-Qaida.

I might just add, I remember running into Dick at the White House a 
couple of weeks ago. He never missed an opportunity to be selling what 
he was doing. So he sidled up to me and in his usual aggressive way 
began to discuss his current mission in Afghanistan. He was a dedicated 
public servant, and we will all miss him greatly.
