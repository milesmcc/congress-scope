Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, during the course of the war in Iraq, the 
American people have paid a very heavy price, not just financially, 
although the war has already cost over 400 billion taxpayer dollars, 
but also through the tragic loss of at least 3,775 American lives, with 
countless more injured. And under the President's plan to continue our 
failed policy in Iraq, these immense sacrifices will continue.

According to General Petraeus, if we go forward with this war as the 
President wants us to, on average, two U.S. men and women will die 
every day; another 15 will be wounded each day; and we will spend $300 
million each and every day we are there.

It seems that these massive losses do not register with some of my 
Republican colleagues who continue to support an open-ended commitment 
in Iraq. In fact, Republican Leader Boehner even said recently, when 
asked how much longer we should stay in Iraq, that the sacrifice being 
made will be a small price. I don't think so.
