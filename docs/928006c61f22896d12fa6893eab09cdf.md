Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I submit the following:

Requesting Member: Congressman Kevin Brady, Texas 8th Congressional 
District.

Bill Number: H.R. 2638--The Consolidated Security, Disaster 
Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009.

Account: Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology, 33 
0603005A.

Requesting Entity: Verdient Technologies LLC.

Address of Requesting Entity: 1401 McKinney Street, Suite 900, 
Houston, TX 77010.

Description of Request: For the final year of a 2 year project, I am 
requesting funding aimed at completing a project that will allow 
military personnel in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters to stay 
cool in their vehicles without running the engine. Today vehicles must 
run their engine to keep crew members cool, a heat-signature is created 
and that provides a target for enemy fire and fuel is wasted resulting 
in decreased combat effectiveness and operational range.

The request funds completion of the No-Idle Complex Compound 
(''NICC'') project, which is developing technology powered by diesel 
fuel to cool or heat the crew cabin in military vehicles when the 
vehicle engine is not operating. Without this system, the vehicle 
engine must be idled to provide cooling or heating thus wasting 
significant amounts of fuel, polluting the environment and creating a 
thermal and acoustic signature. The proposed development will design 
and build prototypes of the NICC system for military combat vehicles, 
address critical manufacturing, and quality control processes and 
manufacturing technology. When utilized in combat, the NICC will cool 
personnel and electronics with minimal thermal or noise signature, 
enhancing both the comfort and safety of our troops--allowing them to 
more safely and effectively execute their mission.

The $1.6 million project will be completed in four stages: (1) 
manufacture of three prototypes at $750,000 (47%); (2) tracking results 
of field testing at $450,000 (28%); (3) implement second round of field 
testing at $250,000 (15.5%); and (4) design of final product for 
vehicle integration at $150,000 (9%).

District.

Bill Number: H.R. 2638--The Consolidated Security, Disaster 
Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009.



Account: R1: Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology.

Requesting Entity: Sam Houston State University.

Address of Requesting Entity: Sam Houston State University, 1806 Ave 
J, Suite 303, Huntsville, TX 77340.

Description of Request: With one more year to go before completion, 
this is the second year I have requested funding for TRIES. The project 
has received funding for a total of 7 non-consecutive years. This 
request will provide funds to Sam Houston State University and Texas 
State University System to finalize research of a technology for the 
treatment of contaminated water to make it usable for our troops in the 
field or during natural disasters.

Of the $1.6 million TRIES received this year, approximately $312,000 
(19.5%) will go to direct labor; $360,000 (22.5%) for materials; 
$824,000 (51.5%) for other direct expenses; and $104,000 (6.5%) for 
demonstration.
