`Mr. KLEIN of Florida â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when President Bush announced that 
he was keeping the troop escalation plan in effect until next summer, 
it was clear that he had no plan for ending the war in Iraq. In fact, 
the administration admits that they see our troops remaining in Iraq 
for at least 10 more years.

President Bush continues with the status quo in Iraq even though the 
Iraqi Government is not fulfilling its promise to meet the political 
benchmarks that were outlined by President Bush himself earlier this 
year.

House Democrats are not going to tolerate another decade of our 
troops serving as referees in a civil war. And while this Congress 
cannot force the President to change course in Iraq until some of our 
Republican colleagues break ranks with the administration, I think that 
they even see the value in forcing this administration to finally come 
up with an exit strategy that is strategic in purpose.

Today the House will vote on legislation that would require the 
President and his administration to develop and submit a comprehensive 
redeployment strategy within the next 60 days. This war cannot go on 
indefinitely, and this administration needs to begin preparing for the 
day that we can finally bring our troops home.
