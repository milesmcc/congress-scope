Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, less than a month ago, Congress 
finally began the debate on the war in Afghanistan that really should 
have been held 9 years ago, but the fact remains Congress cannot 
continue to write a blank check for a war in Afghanistan that has 
ultimately made our country less safe. Our brave men and women in 
uniform have been put in an impossible situation in Afghanistan where 
there is no military solution. We should use this money to bring them 
home.

The Congressional Black Caucus included in the previous supplemental 
that the House passed the black farmer settlement and youth employment 
provisions, and in the supplemental it was passed several times. It was 
paid for, yet the Senate took these provisions out.

Let's support jobs and justice for the black farmers who have waited 
so long


for our government to act. Let's support our teachers. Let's not spend 
another dime to escalate America's longest war.

I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on this supplemental that we will 
be considering later in the day.
