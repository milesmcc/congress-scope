Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we are about to 
begin the 2010 fiscal year having enacted just one appropriations bill. 
I am even more disappointed that we passed a continuing resolution, 
airdropped into the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, that 
provides money to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. While I am 
pleased that the President has committed to withdrawing our troops from 
Iraq by the end of 2011, this redeployment schedule is too long and may 
undermine our ability to combat al-Qaida while straining our Armed 
Forces unnecessarily. In addition, while the President is right to 
focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan, I remain concerned that his strategy 
for those countries does not adequately address, and may even 
exacerbate, the threats to our national security we face in Pakistan.

We need to keep the Federal Government operating and make sure our 
brave troops get all the equipment and supplies they need, but we 
should not be providing funds to continue those wars without, at a 
minimum, engaging in a serious debate about their effects on our 
national security.
