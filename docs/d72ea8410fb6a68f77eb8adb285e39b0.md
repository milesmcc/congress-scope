Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the Senator's question. The fact is, as I 
mentioned earlier in my comments, we have used the National Guard in an 
unprecedented way. They have been called for deployment abroad, both in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, and elsewhere in unprecedented numbers. The 
stress we


have created on the force by virtue of these two continuing 
engagements, as well as any other national emergency that might occur, 
is incredibly challenging. It is real challenging to those forces. My 
view is the Senator is right.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
