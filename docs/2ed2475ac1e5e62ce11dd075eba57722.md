Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this final 
legislation to provide emergency supplemental appropriations for Fiscal 
Year 2007. While this final compromise is not perfect, I will vote for 
it to provide necessary funds for our troops in the field as well as 
meet other important priorities.

This bill contains more funding than the President requested for 
military health care and veterans health care. It expresses the support 
of the U.S. Congress for a new direction in Iraq by tying economic aid 
to 18 specific benchmarks on political, security and economic progress, 
although it provides the President the waiver authority he negotiated 
before agreeing to sign the bill. This bill also includes the first 
raise in the minimum wage in a decade as well as critical funding for 
domestic needs like hurricane recovery efforts.

I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress from both 
political parties as well as the President and the Administration to 
provide a new direction in Iraq and to meet the critical needs of the 
people of North Carolina's Second Congressional District.
