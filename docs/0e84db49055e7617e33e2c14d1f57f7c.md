`Mr. FEINGOLD â€” 10 July 2008`

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is generally my policy to defer to 
Presidents on executive branch nominations. Accordingly, I voted to 
confirm the nominations of General Petraeus and Lieutenant General 
Odierno. However, I am concerned that General Petraeus has not always 
been forthright in his congressional testimony about matters such as 
the limitations of the Iraqi Security Forces and Iran's influence over 
the Iraqi government. I am also concerned that General Petraeus, as 
CENTCOM Commander, would continue to prioritize deployments to Iraq 
over Afghanistan, despite al-Qaida's safe haven along the Afghanistan 
border in Pakistan and its support for a resurgent Taliban. I look 
forward to a new administration that recognizes that the Iraq war is a 
distraction from our top national security priority--the global fight 
against al-Qaida and its affiliates.
