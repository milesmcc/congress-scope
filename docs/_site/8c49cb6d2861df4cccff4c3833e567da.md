 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the 114th Fighter 
Wing of the South Dakota Air National Guard for being awarded the 2007 
Outstanding Air National Guard Flying Unit Award.

Since 1956, the 114th Fighter Wing has been an outstanding unit and 
has played an important role in the South Dakota National Guard. The 
unit has a proud history of accomplishment and this award is in keeping 
with that tradition. Over the years, the 114th has received numerous 
unit citations such as the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award and the 
Armed Forces Expeditionary Streamer for combat duty as a part of 
Operation Just Cause in Panama. The 114th Fighter Wing has trained with 
the Navy, Marines, and the Air Force during Operation Provide Comfort 
II in Turkey, Commando Sling in Singapore, Operation Southern Watch in 
Al Jaber, Kuwait, and numerous others. Today, the unit is continuing to 
uphold its


standard of excellence by providing significant contributions in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the War on Terror. Their 
courageous efforts in protecting America should make both South Dakota 
and the Nation proud.

It gives me great pleasure to represent the men and women who make up 
the 114th Fighter Wing and congratulate them on their award.
