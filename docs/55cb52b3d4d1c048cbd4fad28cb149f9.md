Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished 
chairwoman for yielding me the time.

The question here is one of unexpended balances. The amendment is 
requesting an additional $140 million for rule of law democracy-related 
programs, but the supplemental that is still warm on the President's 
desk provided $250 million for those democracy activities, and they 
have not been expended; $67.6 million for civil society and $57.4 
million targeted for development for $125 million in governance 
programs, and they still haven't been expended; $150 million in rule of 
law activities that have not been expended as we move forward with the 
surge.

So, Mr. Chairman, it is premature to request $140 million additional 
dollars, page 40, line 26 of the gentleman's amendment, for moneys that 
have not been expended that the Congress just voted on in this 
particular bill. The same can be said of the gentleman's request on 
page 58, line 18, and page 63, line 23, $2 million. We have $18 billion 
to date appropriated for Iraqi Security


Forces. Where does the figure $2 million come from? It comes from 
nowhere, Mr. Chairman.

Support the chairwoman's request to defeat this amendment.
