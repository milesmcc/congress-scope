Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, the best way to stop a disastrous war would 
have been not to have started it, but the American people know that, it 
having been started, we did have a moral obligation to the Iraqi people 
to give them a reasonable chance to form a government. But after 4 
years, after 3,600 lives, after $450 billion of American money sunk 
into the sands of Iraq, that moral obligation has been fulfilled in 
spades.

Now we have a moral obligation to our sons, a moral obligation to our 
daughters, a moral obligation to our husbands and wives. The moral 
obligation to Iraq has been completed. The moral obligation to our 
families now needs to be honored, and it could only be honored by 
passage of this resolution.

Now, people have said that we can't just leave; we need a way 
forward. There is only one way forward to security, to reduce the 
threats from the Mideast, and that is to break our addiction to oil 
from that region of the world.

Take one-half of the $80 billion and put it in energy efficiency, 
we'll give you security. Pass this resolution.
