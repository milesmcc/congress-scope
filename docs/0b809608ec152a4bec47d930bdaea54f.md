# PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 301,  PAKISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `0b809608ec152a4bec47d930bdaea54f`
`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 27 July 2010`

Mr. KUCINICH. The Times quotes General Petraeus as acknowledging 
''longstanding ties between Pakistan's Directorate for Inter-Services 
Intelligence'' and what he calls the ''bad guys.''

And the Times goes on to say in this editorial, ''The Times's report 
of the new documents suggests the collusion goes even deeper, that 
representatives of the ISI''--that's their spy agency in Pakistan--
''have worked with the Taliban to organize networks of militants to 
fight American soldiers in Afghanistan and hatch plots to assassinate 
Afghan leaders.''

I'm saying, do we want these people to be our partners, people who 
are playing a double game with us? This is why we've got to get out of 
Pakistan. We have to take a different approach here, and in the debate 
that will ensue in the next, you know, few hours, whenever it's 
scheduled, I hope to be able to get to some of the specifics of why 
this resolution is important at this time.

Thank you, Mr. McGovern. Thank you, Mr. Dreier, for the opportunity.
