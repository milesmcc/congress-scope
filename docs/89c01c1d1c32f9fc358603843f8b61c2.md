Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, today we take a vital step toward 
fulfilling one of Congress' most basic and important responsibilities. 
We will provide the men and women of the United States military with 
the resources they need to carry out their missions in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, missions for which they are risking their lives.

While I wish we would have been able to send a bill to the President 
sooner, passage of this bill today will ensure that funding is provided 
to the Department of Defense without any operational disruptions.

Without this bill, the Department of Defense would be forced to use 
inefficient and costly budget workarounds throughout the month of 
August. According to testimony the Armed Service Committee received 
last week, without this bill the Department of Defense would be forced 
in September to furlough thousands of civilian employees and would even 
be forced to reprogram funding to pay the troops.

Instead, by passing this bill today on a strong bipartisan vote, we 
can uphold the best traditions of Congress in support of our national 
security.
