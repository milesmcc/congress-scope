Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, I stand with my colleagues from the 
State of Georgia in support of H.R. 6847, which designates a postal 
facility in Ellijay, Georgia, in honor of First Lieutenant Noah Harris.

H.R. 6847 enjoys the support of the entire House congressional 
delegation


from Georgia and was introduced by my colleague, Representative Nathan 
Deal of Georgia, on September 9, 2008.

H.R. 6847 calls for honoring First Lieutenant Harris and his service 
for our country by designating the post office in his hometown of 
Ellijay, Georgia, as the ''Noah Harris Post Office.''

First Lieutenant Noah Harris was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 69th 
Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Benning, 
Georgia, when he died on June 18, 2005 in Iraq of injuries sustained on 
June 17 when he was on mounted patrol and his Humvee was attacked by 
enemy forces using rocket-propelled grenades. Also killed was First 
Lieutenant Harris' friend and comrade, Corporal William A. Long.

Madam Speaker, in honor of First Lieutenant Noah Harris, his 
sacrifice and service to this Nation, I urge my colleagues to join in 
support in the passage of H.R. 6847.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
