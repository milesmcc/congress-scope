Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.

Perhaps my good friend from California has not heard the news. The 
Pentagon has now said that we are indeed enmeshed in a civil war and we 
now have a plan B. What we are going to do now is deal with insurgents 
so that we can try to pacify them and get pockets of peace somewhere, 
here and there in Iraq, never mind the Iraqi Government we have been 
holding up all this time.

This may be news to him, but as far as I am concerned, the Pentagon 
has really called it straight, and I consider it a break with what the 
White House has been telling us.

We know the President said time and again he would never negotiate 
with any insurgents. Well, that was yesterday.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
