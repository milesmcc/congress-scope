`Mr. CANTOR â€” 27 July 2007`

Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentlewoman. Again, it is very rare for that 
to happen, especially when there was absolutely no amendment deadline 
given to the Members and the notice only coming since 9 o'clock last 
night.

I would ask the gentlewoman further on the DoD approps bill, you have 
been talking about having an Iraq vote each week before we leave. Do 
you anticipate a freestanding bill next week, or do you expect 
legislation to be confined to a DoD approps bill having to do with 
Iraq?
