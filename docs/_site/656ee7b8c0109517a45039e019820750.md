Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, and 
I thank her for her leadership on this rule and to get this bill to the 
floor so we can begin the big task of restoring accountability and 
oversight in our Federal contracting system.

I rise in support of the rule today and in support of H.R. 1362. I 
strongly believe we must restore the American people's faith in our 
government, and that is what this bill is about.

This bill will help stop the abuses of the Federal contracting 
system, a system that has deservedly come under fire recently, and 
sadly, whether it is in Iraq, Walter Reed, or many other places.

H.R. 1362 will increase transparency and accountability to help bring 
back the integrity to a system that has lost so much of the public's 
trust, and it is no wonder that we have lost so much of the public's 
trust when we have government auditors testifying that an estimated $10 
billion in reconstruction spending has been wasted as a result of 
overcharging, poor tracking, and mismanagement by U.S. contractors. But 
this is not only an issue about waste, abuse and fraud, it is about 
getting the job done right and ensuring we have the proper people in 
place to help those who need Federal Government services.

Recent hearings brought to light an Army memorandum showing that the 
decision to privatize support services at Walter Reed was causing an 
exodus of ''highly skilled and experienced personnel.'' And as a 
result, the ''patient care mission are at a risk of mission failure,'' 
the memorandum continued.

So not only do we need to end the waste and ensure taxpayer dollars 
are being used wisely, we need greater oversight and accountability on 
the contracting decisions that are being made in the first place. And 
we need to tell these contractors that if they are going to get a 
contract with the Federal Government, they must play by the rules and 
they must fulfill their responsibilities in an effective and efficient 
manner.

Passing H.R. 1362 and the other bills that have been on the House 
floor this week are important steps in our effort to restore the faith 
in government that has been lost by the American people. I understand 
that additional legislation regarding contractor oversight and 
accountability is in the pipeline,


and I look forward to working with this new Congress and chairmen of 
the committees of jurisdiction on this most important issue.
