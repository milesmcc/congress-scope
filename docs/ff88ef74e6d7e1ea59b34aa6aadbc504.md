# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `ff88ef74e6d7e1ea59b34aa6aadbc504`
`Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
allowing me to speak.

I rise today in support of this resolution. The President's 
escalation, or surge, as he calls it, is not a strategy that will quell 
the violence in Iraq.

We have heard for too long that change in Iraq is just around the 
corner, and we continue to spend billions of dollars and have taken 
thousands of U.S. casualties.

I supported our goals to bring democracy to Iraq, voted for the Iraq 
resolution, and voted for the billions of dollars to support that 
effort. And I will not vote to cut funding for our troops while they 
are in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan.



They are doing their best with a very flawed plan, and that doesn't 
come from just Gene Green saying it. I heard it less than a year after 
we went there, from e-mails that parents forwarded me.

Our goals were great in Iraq. The plan was not. The administration's 
plan has not worked since the first year. It is time we send a strong 
message to the President that we no longer support the administration's 
strategy.

President Bush addressed the Nation on January 10 of this year to 
announce his plans to send an additional 21,500 soldiers and marines to 
Iraq. This move ignores advice from the military and has been tried 
before without success.

General John Abizaid, former commander of the Central Command, 
testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on November 15, 
2006, that he and General George Casey, the Corps Commander, and 
Lieutenant General Martin Dempsey all agreed that more troops were not 
needed. The White House is continuing with the same flawed strategy to 
pacify the country that has not worked, and adding another 20,000 
troops will not make it work.

March 19 of this year will mark 4 years since we went into Iraq. May 
1 will mark 4 years since the President declared ''mission 
accomplished.'' But we turn on the news today and still see headlines, 
''Car Bombers Kill 60 in Baghdad,'' ''Four More American Soldiers 
Killed in Gunfight With Militia.''

We have made great strides in Iraq, but we are now trying to police a 
war between sectarian armies. Our troops have performed all that has 
been asked of them, and according to the National Security Council's 
analysis, we have achieved many of our initial objectives: removing 
Saddam Hussein from power, assisting Iraq with a constitution and free 
elections, and helping establish democratic institutions.

It is time for the Iraqis to take control of their own country and 
that we begin bringing our troops home. This is in the best interests 
of our military, the Iraqis and our national security.

Our forces cannot indefinitely sustain the demands we currently are 
placing on them. Joint Chiefs Chairman Peter Pace acknowledged last 
week when testifying before the House Armed Services Committee that 
nondeployed U.S. forces are not sufficiently equipped, echoing similar 
concerns expressed recently by Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker and 
Lieutenant General Steven Blum, chief of the Pentagon's National Guard 
Bureau.

The Guard, nationwide, is only equipped to about 30 percent of their 
needs. Units are taking equipment with them into theatre and being 
forced to leave much of it for other units to use when they come home. 
It will cost about $25 billion to reequip the National Guard and 
Reserves to pre-Iraqi war levels.

We cannot continue to send troops to Iraq for 12-month deployments 
every other year and expect to maintain a well-equipped and experienced 
fighting force with high morale.

This resolution expresses the beliefs of many Members of this House 
that sending an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq is not in our Nation's 
interests and not a solution for the violence in Iraq. The solution is 
for the Iraqi Government, the elected government, to do what they need 
to do. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.
