Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is with deep sympathy and a heavy 
heart that I express my condolences to the family of SGT Joshua Kirk 
who was killed on October 3 in Afghanistan. Joshua was serving his 
second tour of duty as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The American 
people will forever be grateful for his ultimate sacrifice.

Sergeant Kirk enlisted in the Army in the spring of 2005, joining the 
4th Infantry Division based out of Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, CO. 
He was originally from Thomaston, ME and attended Southern Maine 
Community College, where he met his wife Megan of Exeter, NH, and 
earned a degree in construction technology.

Joshua believed deeply in his mission and in the cause of freedom for 
which he and seven of his fellow soldiers sacrificed their lives 
together. Words will not assuage the anguish each of these soldier's 
family will feel, nor the sense of loss at Fort Carson when these brave 
men failed to return home, but we hope that one day these families will 
take solace in what President Lincoln described as ''the solemn pride 
that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of 
freedom.''

Our Nation can never fully repay the sacrifice Sergeant Kirk and his 
family have made. Through his service, he helped preserve the safety 
and security of the American people. It now falls to all of us to take 
up this responsibility and ensure that the cause Sergeant Kirk gave his 
life for is won for his wife and young daughter.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring the life 
of SGT Joshua Kirk.
