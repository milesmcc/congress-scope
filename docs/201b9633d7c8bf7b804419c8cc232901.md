Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.

As the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) has said, I am 
privileged to stand up here as a former Navy officer with someone who 
has served so well in the U.S. Marine Corps. Someone has said that the 
Navy without the Marine Corps is like a coat without buttons. So it is 
a great bipartisan effort here on what I think is an instrumental bill.

As Mr. Kline knows, and why he has worked on this so assiduously over 
the years, when you lead men and women in combat, what you most want 
them to have is their head in the game. You don't want them looking 
back at some problems at home, at debt at home that is hurting their 
families, nor do you want them looking ahead into some type of future 
that they want to have. Their safety and the safety of their brethren, 
the men and women standing on either side of them, depends upon them 
having their head in the game. That is why this bill is so very 
important.

It is extremely important now in Iraq and Afghanistan. I compare the 
men and women out there and having their head in the game compared to 
those great patriots of the world's greatest generation, World War II. 
Back in World War II, the average soldier was in combat 182 days. There 
were horrific battles from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima to the Battle of the 
Bulge, but there was dwell time in between those great battles. Our 
soldiers, our marines over there in Iraq and Afghanistan go outside the 
wire every day for 15 months. There is unremitting strain upon them. In 
order to have a measure of relieving that, I am proud to stand beside 
you, sir, on this bill.

I urge my colleagues to do what is important, recognize the 
bipartisan approach of this and recognize that this is the way to take 
care of our troops.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
