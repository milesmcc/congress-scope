`Mr. NELSON of Florida â€” 29 June 2007`

Mr. NELSON of Florida. I say to the Senator, Mr. President, that the 
young corporals and privates who are not returning home from Iraq and 
Afghanistan, who leave widows and children who are paying today out of 
their own paycheck into that survivor's benefit plan, of which in that 
insurance program their survivors are entitled, that, in fact, because 
of the current law of the offset, they don't get that which has already 
been paid for by the active-duty military member because of the 
eligibility of the widow and the children under the indemnity 
compensation through the Veterans' Administration. The current law 
offsets one against another.

What is so sad is that the survivors, the widows and children of 
these young corporals and privates, are finding it very difficult to 
make financial ends meet as a result of that offset.

This Senator is going to give the Senate an opportunity to change 
that in 2 weeks when we are on the DOD bill. If the Senate responds as 
we did last year and the year before in passing it, then we are going 
to have to insist when it gets down to a conference committee with the 
House it doesn't get stripped out like the House leadership last year 
and the year before did in stripping out what the Senate has passed.

I share that with my friend from Virginia.
