Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I want to make the point, but I think that is one of 
the things that concerns me most is that this global war on terrorism 
is a real war. So when we talk about bleeding out or getting out or 
whatever you want to call it of Iraq, the thing that the other side has 
not brought to us is what they are going to do next, what is next on 
the agenda, what are they going to do if they pull out of Iraq, then 
how are we going to continue to keep these bad people from following us 
back to the U.S.?

I think that is a real concern, and I think that the fact that the 
gentleman, I did the see the copy of the press conference, and it is 
disconcerting that those folks that are the folks that have the next 
plan.
