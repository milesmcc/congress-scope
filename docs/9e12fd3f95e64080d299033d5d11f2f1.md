Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I thank the gentleman.

I will tell you, ladies and gentlemen, when you begin to fight those 
who are classified as your neighbors--and I don't use that term 
loosely. The Taliban live in Afghanistan. And whenever you determine to 
fight those individuals, it makes it very difficult to win this war.
