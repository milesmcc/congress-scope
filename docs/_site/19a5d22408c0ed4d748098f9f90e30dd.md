Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for the recognition. I rise in 
support of this important piece of legislation. This bill would ensure 
that members of the U.S. military, the Foreign Service, or the 
intelligence community who are deployed overseas are not penalized by 
the requirement to repay the first-time homebuyer tax credit.

For those who have been stationed abroad for at least 90 days this 
year, it would also provide an additional year to qualify for the 
first-time homebuyer tax credit. This would include the 1st Squadron, 
221st Cavalry out of Las Vegas, Nevada, and the 1st Battalion of the 
168th Medevac Unit of the Nevada National Guard. Both are deployed 
overseas in Afghanistan on behalf of their Nation.

The brave men and women who selflessly serve this country should not 
be penalized because of their commitment to our Nation. This 
legislation ensures that they do not miss out on the important housing 
tax benefit.

I encourage my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.
