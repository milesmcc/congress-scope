`Mr. PITTS â€” 3 May 2007`

Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, as we debate our policy in Iraq, perhaps it's 
useful to consider a lesson from history.

In all the media coverage of the war supplemental debate, a shameful 
anniversary in our history slipped by, mostly unnoticed.

Last week marked the anniversary of Congress's decision to cut off 
military funding for our involvement in Southeast Asia. The result, as 
predicted, was genocide; 3 million innocent people slaughtered in 
Cambodia's killing fields.

Mr. Speaker, similar warnings exist today in Iraq. Observers from 
across the political spectrum say a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. 
forces from Iraq could very likely result in a region-wide bloodbath. 
No one wants to see this, yet withdrawal is what many in this body are 
pushing for.

Mr. Speaker, before we act, let's remember the lesson of history. And 
we all want our troops to come home safely, but we need to win first 
and then come home. Defeat, surrender and genocide are not acceptable 
alternatives.

And Mr. Speaker, as a personal note, I'd like to say before I end, 
welcome to the world to little Joseph Thomas Offutt, a new grandson, 
namesake born earlier this week, 9 pounds, 14 ounces. You've brought 
great joy and happiness to our family. May you enjoy a long, good life.
