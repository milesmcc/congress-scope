`Mr. McCAIN â€” 20 September 2007`

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will 
not object, I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator Levin. I want 
to mention this: Is it the chairman's understanding that after that, we 
would probably go to the Levin-Reed amendment and have a time agreement 
following that? Is it also the chairman's understanding that any Iraq-
related amendment would probably be a 60-vote requirement? Finally, is 
it also the understanding of the chairman that at 3 p.m. today we would 
expect all amendments to be filed on this bill?
