`Mr. HOYER â€” 6 November 2007`

Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I first want thank the Chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee, David Obey--who also chairs the Subcommittee 
on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education--for his hard work 
and vision in putting this appropriations conference report together.

I also want to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military 
Construction and Veterans Affairs--Congressman Edwards of Texas--for 
his outstanding work on this conference report and his unwavering 
dedication to our Nation's veterans.

This is an excellent, fiscally responsible conference report that 
makes vital investments in expanding access to health care for our 
people, in educating our children, in job training, in medical 
research, and in providing the largest single increase in the 77-year 
history of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Simply put, this conference report deserves the overwhelming support 
of members--just as the individual bills did when they were considered 
in both the House and Senate.

Recall, we passed the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill on a 
bipartisan vote of 276 to 140, with 53 Republicans joining a nearly 
unanimous Democratic caucus.

The Senate passed its own version of this bill 75 to 19.

And, both chambers passed the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs 
Appropriations bill by overwhelming margins--409 to 2 in the House, and 
92 to 1 in the Senate.

This conference report demonstrates our democratic priorities--as 
well as the President's misguided, shortsighted budget proposals, which 
would cut funding for Labor, Health and Education programs by $3.6 
billion below the enacted funding level in fiscal year 2007.

If the President had his way, he would cut vocational education; 
eliminate all student aid other than work study and Pell Grants; cut 
medical research; cut law enforcement grants; cut education for 
children with disabilities; cut rural health programs; cut clean water 
programs; and cut the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program. The 
American people do not support such a proposal. And neither do 
Democrats.

Thus, this conference report provides $9.8 billion above the 
President's request for Labor, Health and Education programs--which 
barely keeps pace with inflation and population growth.

Through this conference report, 1.2 million more Americans would have 
access to community health centers, and we would increase funding for 
programs that help parents pay for college, for No Child Left Behind 
programs, for vocational education and Job Corps, and for medical 
research into life threatening diseases.

Through this conference report, we also will keep our commitment to 
our Nation's veterans, providing $3.7 billion more than the President 
requested for veterans' medical care, claims processing personnel, and 
facility improvements.

The President has said such funding is unnecessary.

We absolutely disagree.

The idea that we cannot find the funds necessary to invest in health 
care, education and medical research, and in medical care of the men 
and women who have sacrificed for this country is patently absurd--and 
it must be rejected.

How is it that the President can demand that this Congress spend 
another $200 billion of taxpayers' dollars for his failing policy in 
Iraq while he seeks to shortchange critical programs at home?

His vain attempt to try to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility 
by threatening to veto this conference report--particularly in light of 
his disastrous and irresponsible fiscal policies--will fool no one.

Madam Speaker, this is an excellent conference report that reflects 
the priorities of the American people, and rejects the President's 
misguided proposals.

Finally, let me say that Mr. Obey effectively dispensed yesterday--in 
his speech at the National Press Club--with the Republican complaint 
that this conference report threatens enactment of the Military 
Construction-Veterans Affairs bill.

Only once in the last 5 years did the Republican Majority send the 
President a free-standing Military Construction conference report. 
Three times you packaged that bill with others. And last year, you 
failed to even enact a Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bill.

I urge my colleagues: vote for this fiscally responsible conference 
report, which makes critical investments in our Nation, our people and 
our future.
