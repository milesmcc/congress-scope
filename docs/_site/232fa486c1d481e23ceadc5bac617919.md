Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, I appreciate you coming down and articulating 
that. And it's been consistent since we've gotten in with the first 100 
hours as to what we're doing now, what we plan on doing, what we've 
passed out of this House, what we've passed out of this House sometimes 
on several different occasions.

And if you look at the two major supplemental votes, you look at, you 
know, what did we do in the first one is we put timelines in there, 
deadlines in there, date certain we're going to get out of there.

And you stated, I think, so articulately, that the Iraqi soldiers, if 
they know we're going to be there, then they're going to continue to 
rely on us. And if you leave the training wheels on the bike, you're 
never going to learn how to ride on two wheels. And it's time to take 
the training wheels off, Mr. Meek.
