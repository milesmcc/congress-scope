Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I oppose this legislation because it 
does


nothing to bring our open-ended and disproportionate military 
commitment in Afghanistan to an end and/or to ensure that our troops 
are safely and expeditiously redeployed from Iraq. I am concerned that 
our current military strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan may undermine our 
ability to combat al-Qaida while imposing a tremendous burden on our 
brave servicemembers and on American taxpayers.

This bill includes several important provisions, including provisions 
I authored that will help improve care for wounded warriors and the 
hate crimes legislation that was first introduced over 8 years ago. But 
I cannot support a bill that does not do enough to protect our country 
from our top national security threat, al-Qaida.
