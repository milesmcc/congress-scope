`Mr. LEVIN â€” 14 December 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator is recognized, I wish to 
thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, obviously for the comments he 
made about me, which were extremely meaningful to me and will be 
memorable to


my family, although they will discount it hopefully somewhat. I also 
thank him for his leadership in this body and for the way he has fought 
for so many causes, not just for our veterans but our troops. Year 
after year, he is on this floor improving the situation for those who 
have been badly wounded, retired, and disabled. Without that effort, 
the progress we have made in the last few years simply could not have 
happened. I thank him.

I am glad Senator Webb was able to get to the floor. I have already 
thanked him for his work on the Commission on which he and Senator 
McCaskill led an effort, a Commission on contracting in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and there are so many other areas in which he is involved. 
I am delighted he was able to get to the floor for a few minutes.
