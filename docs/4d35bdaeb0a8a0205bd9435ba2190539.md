`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 9 April 2008`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of course, no one has said that, and my 
dear friend, the majority leader, knows it. That is a swipe at Senator 
McCain, who was talking about troop deployments overseas, not the 
continued engagement in warfare. The mainstream media--which has not 
been particularly friendly to the war--has hammered those who have 
accused Senator McCain of saying we were going to have a 100-year war 
in Iraq.

This is a deliberate misrepresentation of what he has said. Anybody 
who looks at the entire exchange, which occurred in a town meeting in 
New Hampshire back in January, knows precisely what he was saying. He 
was talking about having troops deployed overseas, which we have had in 
Germany and Japan and South Korea for many years. He was talking about 
a situation under which they are not under attack, not being killed or 
wounded but deployed overseas, not only to protect our security 
interests but also to reassure our allies. That is what Senator McCain 
was talking about. No one I know is suggesting--and it is almost 
laughable to suggest--that we are talking about that kind of lengthy 
military engagement.
