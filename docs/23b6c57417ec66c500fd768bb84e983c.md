Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his assessment in 
support of this Blue Dog resolution to demand accountability in Iraq. 
And with the remaining 3 or 4 minutes left in this Special Order, Mr. 
Speaker, I yield as much time as the gentleman from Florida, a new 
member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a new Member of this Congress, Mr. 
Mahoney, may so desire.
