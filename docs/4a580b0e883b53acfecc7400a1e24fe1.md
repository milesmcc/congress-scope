Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Staff 
Sergeant Jeffrey Alan Hall. On June 1, 2009, Jeffrey was killed in 
action in Afghanistan. As north Alabama mourns this sudden, devastating 
loss, I would like to recognize Staff Sergeant Hall and his entire 
family's sacrifice.

Jeffrey was an 8-year veteran of the United States Army, earning many 
well-deserved awards and decorations, including two Army Commendation 
Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, a NATO Medal, and a Global 
War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.

Staff Sergeant Hall is an inspiring example of someone we can all 
look up to and inspire to be like. He put the safety of all Americans 
before his own, and the people of this Nation will be forever grateful. 
He motivated and inspired those who were around him, and he will be 
greatly missed by all who knew him, as well as those who never had the 
honor and privilege of meeting him.

Our country has lost a great soldier and an even better son. All of 
us in north Alabama are deeply saddened by the loss of Jeffrey. On 
behalf of the entire community in the Tennessee Valley and across 
Alabama and the Nation, I rise today to join Huntsville Mayor Tommy 
Battle, the United States Army, and the family of Jeffrey Hall in 
honoring his service, memory, and life.
