`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 22 March 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my support for the 
supplemental, not because I agree with everything that is in it, but 
because I agree with one thing that is in it, and that is a binding 
deadline to end the war in Iraq and redeploy our troops to where they 
are truly needed, and that is to fight the real war on terror where the 
terrorists started to bomb our country and planned to bomb us on 9/11 
and that is in the mountains of Afghanistan.

Why are we fighting a civil war in Iraq? Why are we fighting a civil 
war in Iraq when it is in Afghanistan where the war should be fought? 
Why are our Republican friends talking about protecting our national 
security in Iraq when in fact it is al Qaeda in Afghanistan that is 
posing the greatest threat to our national security?

It is this supplemental that talks about fighting the real national 
security threat to our Nation, and that is


why I support this important supplemental, because it truly supports 
our troops and it supports our veterans as well.

Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my support for this supplemental, not 
because I agree with everything in it, but because I agree with the 
most important thing in it: a binding deadline to end the war in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, we need to redeploy our troops from Iraq first and 
foremost because it is in our national security interest.

As someone who voted for the original resolution, I am particularly 
pained by the hardships and suffering our troops and their families 
endure. I want them to come home.

But I also know that the men and women in uniform, and the families 
behind them, are willing to make the sacrifices they do if that is what 
it takes to make America more secure.

The truth is policing a civil war in Iraq does not bring us closer to 
defeating the global network of extremists who wish to harm us.

But redeployment from Iraq will enhance our security by allowing us 
to properly address other challenges around the world, most importantly 
the fight in Afghanistan and Pakistan against a resurgent al Qaeda and 
Taliban, the enemies who actually did engineer 9/11.

The moral authority we've lost in the eyes of the world compromises 
our ability to lead multinational efforts against national security 
threats ranging from terrorism and nuclear proliferation to global 
warming and drug trafficking.

The sooner we begin redeployment, the sooner we begin unraveling the 
tremendous damage that this war and its mismanagement have wrought on 
our national security.

We need to restore America's leadership. We need to strengthen 
America's security. We need to pass this supplemental and begin the 
redeployment from Iraq.

I believe in a strong U.S. engagement around the world, including 
using military force when necessary. I also believe, as did Presidents 
Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Reagan, that America's greatest 
strength comes from its values and its ability to lead.
