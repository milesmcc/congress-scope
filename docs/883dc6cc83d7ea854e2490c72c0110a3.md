`Mr. CONRAD â€” 21 March 2007`

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois, 
Senator Obama, for the wisdom he has displayed with respect to the 
conflict in Iraq. I read a speech he gave when he was a State Senator 
warning about the dangers of going to war in Iraq. In many ways it 
reflected many of the same feelings and analysis I had given in my 
speech on the floor of the Senate.

I gave the last speech before that fateful vote to authorize going to 
war in Iraq. I believed at the time it was a mistake to go to Iraq 
before finishing business with Osama bin Laden. After all, it was 
Saddam Hussein in Iraq whom this administration decided to go after. 
But it was not Saddam Hussein or Iraq that attacked this country on 9/
11, it was Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida network that had attacked 
this country. We have still never held Osama bin Laden to account. I 
have always felt that was an extremely serious mistake, a military 
mistake for this country. I was so impressed that the Senator from 
Illinois, who was a State senator at the time, had the wisdom and the 
judgment to see that. I wish more had seen it.

I, again, thank the Senator from Illinois.
