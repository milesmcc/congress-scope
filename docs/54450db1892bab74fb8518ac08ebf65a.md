## `54450db1892bab74fb8518ac08ebf65a`
`Mr. GINGREY â€” 10 September 2007`

Mr. GINGREY. The gentleman is so, so right. Here we are talking about 
a four-star general, West Point graduate, 35 years of military service, 
third rotation in Iraq, to have to put up with that kind of despicable 
attack. And, like I say, we are going to give our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle an opportunity to repudiate that, which I am sure 
they will.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Tennessee, 
Mr. Wamp.
