`Mr. KLEIN of Florida â€” 28 June 2007`

Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. 
Hodes).

I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight as members of our 
freshman class. We try to get together about once a week to speak to 
each other and to speak to the Members on the floor here about the 
importance of what we were elected to do, along with every other 
Member, Democrat and Republican, in this Chamber.

Certainly this last election had a lot to do with the war and the 
strategy of the war and whether waging the war in the way it was being 
waged was successful. And of course success, at least in my view and 
the people that I have spoken to, is what can we do to enhance and 
protect the American people? All of us, in our homes, our cities, our 
country, and certainly our friends abroad.

At this time, it seems pretty clear, and I think it's been pretty 
clear to the American people for a long time who have been ahead of the 
President and ahead of the Congress in their thinking about this, that 
the national security of our country, of course coming first, is not 
being enhanced by having our fighting men and women, our brave men and 
women fighting a war that by and large is the participation of a civil 
war, a civil war among groups of people that unfortunately have been 
fighting each other for a long, long time; that by us dropping in our 
own form of democracy in that region, it just doesn't necessarily work 
that way. Although we would like to believe as Americans, and we know 
that we have the best system in the world, it just can't be planted in 
some other part of the world and just accepted as it is.

So the reality is, what can we do? What are the choices? And I have 
not been one who said immediate withdrawal. There are some in this 
Chamber that believe in immediate withdrawal, there are some that say 
we should be there for 10, 20, 30, 50 years, as long as it takes.

I think the reality is, there has to be a better way. And I think 
that we've heard from many of our military experts. When President Bush 
says, let's listen to the military experts, I agree. But it's not just 
the military experts that are telling you what you want to hear, it's 
the military experts that have been our generals, people that have 
served in that region, continue to serve in that region, and not just 
as soon replace them if they don't agree with the present 
administration.

There are answers, just like anything else. It doesn't matter if it's 
health care or energy, there are answers to all these things. People 
solve problems all day long. Americans are very innovative, energetic 
people. There are answers to this one as well. They may not be the 
answers we're looking for that are the ultimate best answers, but there 
are ways that we can best protect our interests in the Middle East, our 
support of the State of Israel and other friends in that region, and 
then most importantly, the people that live in our country. And those 
may be redeployment, moving our troops out of harm's way and into areas 
where maybe the borders are secured; or maybe, as we know now, 
the major mistake was that the entire Iraqi leadership of its armed 
forces was basically eviscerated, they're gone and moved away. And so 
the result is you have an Iraqi Army that by and large is leaderless. 
And they've been trying to make amends on that and trying to deal with 
that, but they're still way behind their curve. We can probably provide 
some support in that area.


But we do also know at the same time, in terms of our national 
security interests, if we think about what brought us to this point so 
far and why we have this threat of terrorism, is because we were 
attacked on 9/11, nothing to do with Iraq, but Osama bin Laden and al 
Qaeda. That issue has to do with Afghanistan and maybe other areas of 
Pakistan. That's where our military might, our strength, our troops, 
our ability to build coalitions around the world, which we've lost 
along the way here, that's where we can have the most impact.

So Mr. Hodes, I would just like to open with those thoughts. I know 
we're going to have a little bit of discussion on that. But I want the 
American people to know and I want our Members here in the Chamber to 
understand, there are choices; there are good choices, there are better 
choices, and there are choices to move forward. To stand still, to say 
the surge and all those things, we need to move forward and best 
protect our troops and best protect Americans.
