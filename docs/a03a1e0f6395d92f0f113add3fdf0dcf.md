Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.

First, we all acknowledge that Iran is involved in sending deadly 
weapons into Iraq which are threatening the lives of American soldiers 
as well as those who are trying to seek a peaceful and stable Iraq. 
That is a fact. It is one that the Senator from Connecticut has 
condemned, and I join him in that condemnation. I think that is a large 
part of his effort with this amendment.

Secondly, I might add that Senator Smith of Oregon and I have 
introduced a resolution relative to the proliferation issue in Iran, 
and we have quite a few cosponsors on both sides of the aisle. We are 
not calling it on this bill, but we may soon, and to find diplomatic 
ways to discourage Iran from developing nuclear weapons, which would be 
destabilizing and dangerous to the Middle East and the world.

But I have a specific question I want to ask of the Senator from 
Connecticut in light of the modification of his amendment. Does this 
amendment, now, that the Senator has presented, as modified, authorize 
the use of military force by the United States against Iran?
