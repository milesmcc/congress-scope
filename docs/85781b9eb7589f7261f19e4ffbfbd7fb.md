# PAKISTAN DISLOYAL ALLY?

Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I heard from a Texan yesterday who 
was mad about why taxpayers are shelling out another $500 million for 
Pakistan. Americans are already giving Pakistan $1 billion a year. And 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said officials in Pakistan know 
where Osama bin Laden is hiding. Well, why don't they tell us where the 
terrorist of the desert, Osama bin Laden, is?

Isn't Pakistan supposed to be with us in this war in Afghanistan? And 
if they're not our ally, why are we giving them billions of taxpayer 
dollars? Now, in light of the illegal release of classified documents, 
Pakistan also appears to be taking our money and supporting our enemy, 
the Taliban. Maybe Pakistan isn't the loyal ally we pay them to be.

We should not be giving money we need here at home to countries that 
are friends in public and thieves behind closed doors. As my colleague 
Louie Gohmert says, ''We don't have to pay these people to hate us. 
They will do it for free.''

And that's just the way it is.
