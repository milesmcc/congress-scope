Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, Major Scott Nisely, a father, athlete and musician, made 
the ultimate sacrifice for his country on the field of battle and 
deserves the honor of having his name on the post office in 
Marshalltown, Iowa, where he worked for 12 years.

Scott was born in Syracuse, Nebraska in 1958, and excelled in track 
and cross country. He attended Doane College on a track scholarship and 
pursued a degree in biology.

He showed a passion for his country and did not shy away from the 
duty of serving his Nation. While in college, he enlisted in the United 
States Marine Corps ROTC, and after completing his Bachelor's degree in 
1981, he was commissioned an Infantry Second Lieutenant in the U.S. 
Marine Corps.



He rose to the rank of captain and commanded an infantry company 
during Operation Desert Storm. After his tour in Kuwait and Iraq, he 
returned to the Reserves, where he was promoted to the rank of major.

Scott continued to serve his community even when out of the military. 
In 1994 he began working for the U.S. Postal Service in Marshalltown. 
He participated in his church's music ministry program and was active 
at the local tae kwon do. Above all, he worked tirelessly to serve 
others.

Even with such an impressive record of service under his belt, he 
could not ignore the call of duty. When his country went to war again, 
he enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard and accepted the rank of 
staff sergeant in order to do so. In 2005, he returned to Iraq with C 
Company of the Iowa National Guard's 133rd battalion.

On September 30, 2006, he was providing security for a convoy in Al 
Anbar Province, Iraq, when his company came under insurgent small arms 
fire. He and a fellow member of the Guard were killed.

His decorations include the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Bronze Star 
Medal, the Oak Leaf Cluster, the Purple Heart, the Army Achievement 
Medal, and a dozen others.



Let us pay our respect to Major Scott E. Nisely and remember his 
commitment to serving this Nation by naming the Marshalltown post 
office in his honor.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
