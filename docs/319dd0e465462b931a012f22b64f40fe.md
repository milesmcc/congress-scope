# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `319dd0e465462b931a012f22b64f40fe`
`Mr. SMITH of Texas â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank my 
friend and colleague from New Jersey for yielding me time.

Madam Speaker, this nonbinding resolution is really a nonsensical 
political statement. It would deprive our troops of the reinforcements 
they desperately need. Let us trust their judgment and give them the 
reinforcements they want.

How would you feel if you were an American soldier in Iraq and 
Congress passed this resolution? It is like telling you to fight with 
one arm behind your back, and that is no way to defeat a terrorist.

It is our responsibility to assist our troops, not discourage them by 
ignoring their needs. This political resolution shortchanges our 
generals and their troops. Instead, we should support those who are 
sacrificing their lives to protect ours.



Our men and women in uniform desire only to serve their country with 
honor. Rather than deny them what they want, we should give them the 
resources they deserve.

Unfortunately, many terrorists hate our country, our citizens, our 
freedoms and our way of life. The global war on terror is fierce; this 
is no time to appear weak. London, Moscow, Madrid and six other cities 
around the world have suffered terrorist attacks since 9/11, but there 
is a reason no terrorist attack has occurred in America since 2001. It 
is not because some would second-guess our military; it is because our 
troops want to win, and we should give them that opportunity.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and 
send the troops this message: We are here to help you.
