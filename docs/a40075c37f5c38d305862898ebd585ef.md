Mr. McCAIN. Again, I also would ask my colleague, have we forgotten 
the lessons of history? We were there and we assisted the Afghans in 
driving out the Russians. Our assistance was critical. The Russians 
left and we left.

When we left, it left a vacuum that ended up with the fighting 
between warlords, and the Taliban filled the vacuum, the Taliban had an 
arrangement with al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden, and the terrorists who 
attacked us on 9/11--which we just commemorated--were able to be 
trained in Afghanistan.

I hope our memories are not so short that we are willing to risk a 
repetition of that kind of threat, which the President, during the 
campaign, seemed to recognize very accurately; called it the ''good 
war.'' He said it ''was a war we had to win,'' ''do what is necessary 
to win.''

Now I worry--I wonder if my colleague does--that every day we delay 
doing what we all know is necessary puts the lives of young Americans 
who are already there at risk and makes it a longer period of time 
before we can prevail.
