Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of SSG Coby 
G. Schwab, a true American hero, who died on Thursday, May 3, 2007 of 
injuries sustained in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Staff Sergeant Schwab died of injuries sustained when an improvised 
explosive device detonated near his vehicle in Ar Ramadi, Iraq. He was 
assigned to the 321st Engineer Battalion, United States Army Reserve 
stationed out of Hayden Lake, Idaho.

Staff Sergeant Schwab was a hero whose desire to serve his country 
will forever make an impact on his family, his community and his 
country. He joined the United States Army to serve his country in the 
Global War on Terror. He will not only be remembered for his sacrifice 
and willing service, but for the extraordinary person that he was. His 
warmth and optimism brightened the lives of his family and friends.

Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the life SSG Coby G. Schwab. He 
acted heroically and made the ultimate sacrifice for his country while 
fighting the War on Global Terror defending democracy and freedom.
