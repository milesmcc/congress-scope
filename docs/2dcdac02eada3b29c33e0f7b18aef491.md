Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to be here and to speak on 
behalf of this resolution that honors the members of the Agri-business 
Development Teams that have been operating. These are joint missions 
that combine some of the best of our military capabilities, the best of 
our civilian capabilities, and they are operating in some of the most 
important areas we need to succeed.

We've seen the success of these teams on the ground in Afghanistan. 
We have heard from our military leaders how essential they are to our 
success. We are very pleased that our Missouri National Guard has been 
one of the leading groups that has done this. They have worked with our 
universities, with our rural electric co-ops, and many of our civilian 
capabilities have been brought to bear from our farming communities in 
Missouri to help bring more advanced agricultural methods to 
Afghanistan and to be sure that we succeed in the fight against 
terrorism.
