## `251f4437a448e1fc7c3488d3acf40f55`
`Mr. WARNER â€” 24 January 2007`

Mr. WARNER. Did not the CENTCOM commander, who is still the CENTCOM 
commander, General Abizaid, testify before our committee and, in the 
precise words, said he felt that at this time added troops were not 
necessary, more troops would lessen the incentive of the Iraqis to pick 
up the burdens which we are trying to have them assume under 
sovereignty?
