Mr. McCAUL. I submit they should be.

The administration has been vague in its response on this issue and 
perhaps we should entertain the idea of a bill that I would be happy to 
work with the chairman on to ensure that those who have been captured 
on the battlefield in Afghanistan, those terrorist suspects who were at 
Guantanamo who have since been released--many of whom have been 
returned to the battlefield to kill our soldiers--that at the very 
least if we're going to put anybody on the No Fly List and the 
Terrorist Watch List, that these individuals should be placed on this 
list.

And I will be happy to yield.
