# A MEMORIAL DAY TRIBUTE
## `956d55e1fbb49b082b359539641add09`
`Mr. ADLER of New Jersey â€” 24 May 2010`

---


Mr. ADLER of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I wish to honor our fallen 
veterans this Memorial Day on May 31, 2010. On Memorial Day, we pay 
homage to the thousands and thousands of individual acts of bravery and 
sacrifice that stretch back to the battlefields of our revolution and 
to those taking place today in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of 
Afghanistan.

Today we honor and remember four brave soldiers from Moorestown, NJ 
who lost their lives in combat. Mr. Walter Seel Jr., Mr. Howard Mayer, 
Mr. George Yohnson, and Mr. Roger Ross were all killed in action during 
the Vietnam War. They are our Nation's heroes who fought so bravely and 
made the ultimate sacrifice to defend the American Dream.

I will never stop fighting to ensure we do right by the men and women 
who serve our Nation and defend our freedom. As we observe Memorial Day 
this year, I ask all of my colleagues and fellow Americans to pause and 
reflect on the centuries of sacrifice by the many men and women that 
this day represents. And let us make sure that all who served with 
honor are honored in return.
