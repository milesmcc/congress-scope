Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I represent the 10th Mountain Division, which 
is located at Fort Drum in my district, and I rise today to honor the 
brave men and women of the Armed Forces who are serving both home and a 
broad to prevent future terrorist attacks against our homeland.

After 8 years of failing to identify a clear plan in Afghanistan and 
provide the resources necessary for our troops to succeed, we are now 
taking the fight against the terrorists to their own turf, and we have 
them on the run. Democrats have worked with this President to 
successfully kill and capture hundreds of al Qaeda and Taliban leaders 
in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Last week, a suicide bombing attack 
on a convoy in Kabul reminded us of the brave sacrifice the men and 
women on the front lines of this fight are making. Two officers from 
the 10th Mountain Division, both lieutenant colonels, were among those 
killed. Lieutenant Colonel Paul R. Bartz and Lieutenant Colonel Thomas 
P. Belkofer were part of a team that was conducting training and 
setting conditions for the 10th Mountain Division deployments to 
Afghanistan later this year. This is a heartbreaking loss for the Fort 
Drum community, and our hearts go out to their families.
