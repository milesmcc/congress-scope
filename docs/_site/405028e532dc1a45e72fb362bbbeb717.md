Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5740, the 
Post 9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Act--bipartisan legislation 
that honors our men and women in uniform and strengthens our military.

I am pleased that this bill was included as part of the emergency war 
funding measure that the House is considering today because I believe 
taking care of those who serve in war is a cost of war. America should 
never fight wars without taking care of our own.

Since World War II, our Nation has offered education benefits to 
returning GIs. The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, the first GI 
Bill, which was passed unanimously by this House, paid for the tuition, 
books, fees, training costs, and even a monthly stipend for our 
returning veterans.

After World War II, nearly 8 million veterans, out of a wartime 
veteran population of 15 million, used the original GI Bill to earn an 
education. The economic return was unprecedented. For every dollar we 
spent on the GI Bill, we generated seven more into our national 
economy. Millions of newly educated veterans led our Nation in business 
and innovation and created the American middle class. It's no wonder 
the GI Bill of 1944 is regarded as one of the most successful pieces of 
legislation to earn this House's approval in the 20th century.

Since that time, Congress has passed other GI bills, but over time, 
the value of the education benefit has declined. The current Montgomery 
GI Bill, for example, was designed for peacetime service, and is not 
meeting the needs of our newest generation of veterans, many of whom 
are returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Our veterans--whether active duty, Reservists, or National 
Guardsmen--deserve an education benefit that accounts for the stress of 
war and keeps up with the rapidly increasing cost of a higher 
education. That is why, with the backing of a broad, bipartisan 
coalition, I introduced H.R. 5740, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational 
Assistance Act.

Under the legislation, GIs returning from Iraq or Afghanistan would 
receive up to 4 academic years of education benefits, including 
stipends for housing and books. They can even use their benefits at 
private schools through the Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement 
Program, in which the Federal Government will match, dollar for dollar, 
any voluntary additional contributions to veterans from institutions 
whose tuition is more expensive than the maximum educational assistance 
provided under this legislation.

Veterans would even have up to 15 years after they leave active duty 
to use their education benefits.

When I was elected to this House, my constituents asked me to work in 
a bipartisan way to find reasonable solutions to our common problems. 
And I think we achieved that with this bill.

Working together with my Democratic and Republican colleagues, we 
attracted more than two-thirds of the House as cosponsors. Ninety-five 
Republicans, nearly half of the minority party's membership, lent their 
support.

I am happy that House leadership was able to build on this support 
and work with the President to come to a bipartisan agreement to 
provide this robust educational benefit to our veterans.

I encourage the Senate to act quickly to pass this new GI Bill and 
make good on our promise of a higher education.

Our veterans have fought for us. The least we can do is fight for 
them.
