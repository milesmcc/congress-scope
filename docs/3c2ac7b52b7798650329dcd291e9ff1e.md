Mr. DENT. I thank the gentlelady. And I thank you for your leadership 
as


a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. But to just 
follow up on what you said, if there are two insurgents or two 
terrorists in Iraq talking to each other by cell phones, what appears 
to be a wireless communication, one to the other, it's likely that that 
call will be routed through the United States, hit a wire, and then 
that would pretty much trigger the Wire Act. And that's what caused the 
intervention of all the lawyers.

So we're talking about the denial of tactical intelligence to our men 
and women who are on the ground, soldiers on the ground and marines on 
the ground not being able to pursue a hot tip or a hot bit of 
information because of the inadequacy of current law.
