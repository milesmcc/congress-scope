Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
amendment to provide funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

These funds should have been provided much earlier this year. They 
are vital if we are to ensure that our troops have the support they 
need until enactment of a full-year supplemental appropriations bill 
for the Global War on Terror.

As I've said before, engaging in a debate on war policy is a 
legitimate and proper role for the Congress. However, we should never 
put ourselves in the position of threatening funding for our troops in 
the field. They deserve our full, unrestricted support.

With passage of this amendment, both the Army and the Marine Corps 
will have the funds they need to continue war operations for the first 
half of fiscal year 2008. However, we need to move quickly next year to 
provide full funding for our soldiers and marines, and for all our men 
and women in uniform. Let's not hold them hostage to Congressional 
debates ever again.

In conclusion, I strongly support this amendment and urge that it be 
adopted by the House. Then we can truly wish all our military a Merry 
Christmas and a Happy New Year.
