Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
publicly condemn the recent remarks of Senator Harry Reid, the majority 
leader of the United States Senate. For the leader of one of the 
greatest legislative bodies in the world to concede defeat in Iraq is a 
sad commentary on the state of politics in our Nation.

Our troops are the finest fighting force this world has ever known. 
Our generals are among the finest military minds in the world. My faith 
is with these brave men and women who put their lives on the line each 
day in battle, and not on the political choices of a Washington, DC 
politician.

The American public does not want our troops to shuffle out of Iraq 
with our tails between our legs. America wants to achieve victory in 
the global war for freedom, a battle whose center is in the Middle East 
and in Iraq. Defeatist comments like ''the war is lost'' should be 
condemned by any freedom-loving Member of this body.
