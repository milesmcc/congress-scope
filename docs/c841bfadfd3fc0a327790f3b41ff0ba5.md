`Mr. KYL â€” 13 July 2007`

Mr. KYL. The reason I want to put this article in the Record is that 
it very clearly points out the problem with the strategy of many of the 
Democrats that I have just outlined, including the notion that somehow 
you could reduce our forces by perhaps half or more and still achieve 
this goal of defeating al-Qaida and training up the Iraqi units.

One of Biddle's key points is that the only way you can successfully 
train up these Iraqi units is having relative stability in the country, 
that if you have an out-of-control war going on, you have to be 
fighting that war, and it is very difficult to at the same time be 
training up these forces. The best way to train the Iraqi military is 
to work in conjunction with U.S. units, as General Petraeus has 
devised, go into an area, clear it, and then leave primarily Iraqi 
units behind to continue to maintain control in the area. But if you 
have constant fighting and you haven't been able to clear or hold the 
area, those Iraqi troops never have that opportunity or the experience 
of holding the area.

So, as Mr. Biddle points out, you can't have it both ways. This 
compromise may satisfy some political requirements back home, but it is 
totally unworkable in the place where it matters, and that is in Iraq. 
You can't withdraw half or more of the troops quickly and have any 
chance of success in maintaining peace and stability and in helping to 
train up the Iraqi forces.

So why are people in the Senate focused on bringing the troops home 
or otherwise micromanaging the way the President deploys the units to 
achieve the mission's objectives? Well, it is either one of two things. 
Now, from outside this body, I know there are a lot of people who have 
a motive of trying to make the President look bad and undercutting his 
authority and undermining the strategy he is following, I gather both 
for partisan reasons and because they just don't think it can work. But 
within the body, here in the Chamber, I know my colleagues do not want 
any American life to have been lost in vain and that they treasure 
every life that has been put on the line. That is why it is troublesome 
to me to have to defeat amendments which have as their core point 
undercutting the President's authority, micromanaging the war from the 
Congress, and specifically calling for early withdrawal, and by early I 
mean before the surge has even had an opportunity to play out.

In that regard, I would like to place in the Record a piece that was 
carried this morning in the Washington Post by Charles Krauthammer, and 
I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.
