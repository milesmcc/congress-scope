Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, last Friday, 24-year-old Army First 
Lieutenant Mark Noziska was laid to rest at West Lawn Memorial Park 
Cemetery in Grand Island, Nebraska. He was killed on August 30 near 
Malajat, Afghanistan, following an IED attack on his patrol. His 
decorations include the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Army 
Commendation Medal.

Lieutenant Noziska was born in Grand Island, and attended high school 
in Papillion. He enlisted in the Army National Guard in March 2004, 
before he graduated from high school that year. He was named Nebraska 
Soldier of the Year in 2005, and after graduating from the University 
of Nebraska-Omaha in 2008, earned his commission. His love of Husker 
football was well-known among his family and friends, many of whom wore 
''Husker Red'' to his funeral. He also loved the Army. He planned a 
lifelong career of service to our nation, and hoped to one day become a 
General.

While Lieutenant Noziska's life was tragically cut short, it is clear 
that he touched and inspired so many of those around him, including the 
many people from the local community who lined the streets to honor his 
service and memory. May God bless Lieutenant Noziska and his family, 
and all our nation's fallen soldiers.
