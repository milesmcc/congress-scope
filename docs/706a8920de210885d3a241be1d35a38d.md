Mr. WARNER. I say to my friend, I have worked on this amendment. I 
spent a good deal of time in the office


of colleagues on the other side of the aisle yesterday, incorporated 
several provisions in this amendment at their request. I say it was a 
good-faith effort to do my very best to point out the need for this 
Senate and the Congress as a whole to get the most timely flow of 
information available to us, both from the President and from two 
independent groups. I say when you get a man of the stature of General 
Jones, who is willing to go out and work with private sector 
organizations to make a professional assessment of the military of 
Iraq, that, I say to my friend, the distinguished leader of the 
Democratic side, is not weak tea. That is a commitment by a very brave, 
credible American to try to help this institution, the Congress, have a 
better understanding about the viability and the professional 
capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces.

I yield the floor.
