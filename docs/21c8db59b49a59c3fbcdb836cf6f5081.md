Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, I fully support the amendment offered by my good friend 
from Virginia (Mr. Wolf). This amendment gives vital assistance for 
demining, counterterrorism, rule of law programs, funding for Iraq 
military training and international human rights. We must remain 
committed to assisting the development of Iraq into a nation that is 
capable of governing itself, sustaining itself, defending itself and 
independently taking all necessary actions to root out terrorists and 
militias that seek to undermine the transition to a free and sovereign 
Iraqi Government, continue to promote democracy and the rule of law, 
continue to provide necessary services to the people of Iraq and 
maintain the authority of the Government of Iraq in all parts of its 
national territory.

My colleagues seek to cut integral components of our effort for 
cooperation and coordination with Iraqi leaders. Mr. Wolf's amendment 
correctly is aimed at strengthening the Iraqi Government to make sure 
that that nation can truly become self-reliant and stable, and not 
count on the U.S. as a blank check any longer.
