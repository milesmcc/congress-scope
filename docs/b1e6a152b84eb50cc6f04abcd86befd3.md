Mr. DONNELLY of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today to solemnly 
remember and honor the life and dedicated service of Specialist Justin 
B. Shoecraft, a native son of Elkhart, Indiana, and a proud member of 
the United States Army. SPC Shoecraft died on August 24, 2010 in Tarin 
Kowt, Afghanistan of wounds sustained when his Stryker vehicle was hit 
by a roadside improvised explosive device in Kakarak, Afghanistan.

Justin graduated from Elkhart Memorial High School in 2001 and worked 
for the United Parcel Service for seven years before enlisting in the 
United States Army. He was assigned to B Troop, 1st Squadron, 2nd 
Stryker Cavalry Regiment out of Vilseck, Germany. His regiment had 
assumed control of Tarin Kowt in July of 2010. Justin was five weeks 
into his first deployment when an improvised explosive device detonated 
near his unit.

Justin was posthumously promoted to the rank of Specialist. His 
awards include the Bronze Star medal (posthumous), the Purple Heart 
Medal (posthumous), the Army Good Conduct Medal (posthumous), the 
National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 
Bronze Service Star, the Global War On Terrorism Service Medal, the 
Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the 
Combat Action Badge (posthumous), the Basic Marksmanship Qualification 
Badge with Expert Rifle Bar, and the Overseas Service Bar.

Justin loved working on old cars and motorcycles, and was a fan of 
stock car racing. He had always wanted to drive tanks for the Army. He 
will be remembered by his friends, family, and fellow soldiers for his 
generosity, work ethic, and sense of humor. He is survived by his wife, 
Jessica, whom he married the day before he left for basic training, his 
parents, Carroll ''Blue'' and Donna, his grandfathers, Walt and Floyd, 
his grandmother, Helen, his brother Michael and sister Sherry, extended 
family and many friends. He will be missed by all.

It is my solemn duty, and humble privilege, to honor the life, 
service, and memory of Specialist Justin B. Shoecraft, which stand as a 
testament to the great honor possessed, and sacrifices made, by our men 
and women in the armed forces, and by their families. We mourn his 
passing and offer solemn gratitude for his service and sacrifice.
