`Mr. YARMUTH â€” 25 September 2007`

Mr. YARMUTH. With brave American soldiers dying in record numbers, I 
have just two questions for the President: Just whose posteriors are we 
kicking? And how do you know?

With Sunnis and Shiites killing themselves and each other, plus an 
incompetent Maliki government, we don't know who we are fighting much 
less where we are kicking them. And while we are tied up in Iraq, al 
Qaeda thrives in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

So the President's turn of phrase will go into the Blooper Hall of 
Fame with other Bush golden oldies, like ''last throes,'' ''links to al 
Qaeda,'' and ''mission accomplished.''

There was a time when American success meant defeating Nazis, tearing 
down communism's iron curtain, and walking on the Moon. Supporting our 
troops meant honest safeguards, not trash talk. How low have our 
standards fallen when the President points to the debacle he created 
and says, ''This is what I am proud of''?

Most Americans believe in a country that is capable of much higher 
standards. And if America were really kicking butt, the President 
wouldn't need to say anything. Everyone would know it.
