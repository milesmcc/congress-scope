Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from 
Michigan. I know he shares my concern about the work that needs to be 
done in the next few days to try to get this bill completed. We do urge 
our colleagues to come forth with relevant amendments. As I mentioned, 
there are at this time, obviously, a number of amendments my colleagues 
will want considered and debated, including two very big amendments on 
Iraq, the Salazar-Alexander amendment, as well as the Reed-Levin 
amendment which I am sure will take up considerable time. Before we 
move to the wounded warrior bill, which I praise for its bipartisanship 
and its effort to bring together both sides of the aisle to address one 
of the most compelling issues of our time, and that is the treatment of 
the men and women who are serving in the military--I will have more 
remarks about that later--I would like to draw my colleagues' attention 
to an editorial that ran last Sunday in the New York Times titled ''The 
Road Home.''

I ask unanimous consent to have that editorial printed in the Record.
