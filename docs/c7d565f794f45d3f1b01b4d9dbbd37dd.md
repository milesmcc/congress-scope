Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, I was pleased 
to see The New York Times acknowledge Afghanistan and Iraq as the 
central front in America's struggle against Islamic extremism. It 
further cites how the United States is making progress turning security 
efforts over to the Iraqi military and police forces.

The Washington Post covered the year-end review by General David 
Petraeus and General Ray Odierno and highlighted how over the last 2 
years there's been a 92 percent decrease in security incidents and a 90 
percent decrease in civilian deaths due to the surge. Attacks have 
dropped from more than 200 a day in 2 years to approximately 15 today.

I want to thank General Petraeus and General Odierno, our troops, 
military families, and veterans for their commitment to victory in Iraq 
and Afghanistan to protect American families at home by defeating 
terrorists overseas.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.

Welcome, Anna Grace Wilson, born December 17, 2009, daughter of 
Jennifer and Alan Wilson, at Lexington Medical Center, West Columbia, 
South Carolina.
