Description of Request: Provides $20,907,000 for construction of 
Phase IV of the Regional Training Institute (RTI), Project Number 
120191, located at Camp Blanding, Starke, Florida 32091. It is my 
understanding that the Florida Army National Guard (FLARNG) and Army 
National Guard readiness will be affected if the school cannot educate 
and train soldiers. This final phase will finish construction of the 
remaining 65,000 square feet of billeting, all remaining 
infrastructure, supporting facilities, and all necessary work not 
completed in the prior phases to support and house students attending 
the courses at the training institute.

Requesting Member: Congressman C.W. Bill Young.

Address of Requesting Entity: Central Avenue, Suite 1370, St. 
Petersburg FL 33701.

Description of Request: Provides $2,400,000 for Battlefield Sensor 
Netting (BSN). BSN will provide the warfighter with unparalleled access 
to mission critical, real-time sensor data. Although tremendous 
progress has been made in the advancement of sensors, there has not 
been a corresponding advancement in data link network technologies that 
can effectively disseminate, display and exploit the tremendous amounts 
of


data generated by modern sensor systems. The Battlefield Sensor Netting 
program bridges the sensor to shooter gap. It would provide a high 
bandwidth data network that combines the advantages of low cost, highly 
capable commercial wireless technologies with the extended range, 
jamming resistance and security provided by phased array antennas, 
military encryption systems and network software.

FL 33764-7290.

Description of Request: Provides $2,400,000 for a Chip Scale Atomic 
Clock project. Atomic clocks allow for accurate time reference for 
communications and navigation systems. However, most atomic clocks are 
very heavy (100 lbs or more), too large for handheld or compact 
electronic systems and also too costly. This project will miniaturize 
the atomic clocks for inclusion on the battlefield, help prevent IED 
jammers from interfering with each other and will provide position 
accuracy even in areas where GPS is unavailable or denied.

Oncology Group (COG) treats 90 percent of children in the U.S. 
diagnosed with cancer, including hundreds of children of the men and 
women serving in our armed forces. In order to meet the needs of 
military families who have children with cancer, the COG developed the 
Uniformed Services Oncology Consortium (USOC). The USOC is a group of 
military institutions within the COG. Because of the COG network, 
children are able to receive state of the art care in COG institutions 
throughout the country and are often treated at institutions other than 
those on a military base because of the increased availability of care. 
This funding will expand on ongoing research by COG with the Department 
of Defense and improve investigations of the genetic, epigenetic and 
signal transduction pathways.

Chemical Biological Threats. Prior to the anthrax laden letters of late 
2001, USF and the other 10 institutions which comprise the State 
University System of Florida were working on preparing the United 
States for an unannounced bioterrorist attack. Until then, basic 
microbiologic research had not been widely transferred from the 
laboratory to actual application in the field. It is in this 
environment that the State University System of Florida with the USF 
College of Public Health as the lead and coordinator was awarded 
Congressional project funds.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: CTC Tampa Bay Inc.

Address of Requesting Entity: 7887 Bryan Dairy Road, Suite 220, 
Largo, FL 33777.

Description of Request: Provides $2,400,000 for Combating Terrorism 
Technical Support Office (CTTSO) and STAR-TEC Partnership. Disruptive 
technologies for potential solutions in combating terrorism are 
frequently created by small, fragile start up enterprises with highly 
unique skills. Historically, 80 percent of these emerging technology 
companies fail before their fifth birthday due to an unbalanced focus 
on product development and insufficient attention to fiscal operational 
management. Statistically, 87 percent of small companies mentored by 
professional business incubators succeed. This project seeks to meld 
STAR-TEC's business incubation and acceleration expertise with CTTSO's 
mission to rapidly field new combating terrorism technology solutions 
to ensure the fiscal health of the domestic, small business partners 
selected by CTTSO for technology acceleration.

to more safely operate this new aircraft. Since most


helicopter flights in Iraq and Afghanistan happen during darkness, it 
is vital that our pilots have this new capability for these wars and 
also in training.
