Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, when General Petraeus was confirmed, the 
majority leader called him a great man. My colleague from California 
referred to him as an amazing man, saying: Of course I listen to 
General Petraeus.

The Senator from Delaware said: I do not know anyone better than 
Petraeus. This is the thanks he gets after 9 months of service in Iraq.
