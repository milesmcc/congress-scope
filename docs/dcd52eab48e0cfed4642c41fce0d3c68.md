Mr. MINNICK. Madam Chair, no group better exemplifies the power of 
what a college education can accomplish in building on practical life 
experiences than that of our Nation's servicemen and -women. So many of 
my State's and our Nation's leaders grew into adulthood through the 
military and then, with the benefit of a quality college education, 
went on to serve their communities and countries in positions of 
significant leadership in all walks of life.



It is critical that members of the Armed Forces who thirst for 
further formal education and show the extra initiative to earn college 
credit while in the service have the opportunity later to count those 
credits toward an advanced degree.

I'm proud to say that my amendment to the Student Aid and Fiscal 
Responsibility Act will enhance that opportunity by allowing servicemen 
and women to transfer academic credits earned while serving in the 
Armed Forces between institutions of higher education so as to benefit 
not only themselves but their families and their country.

My amendment has been endorsed by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans 
of America, the Idaho Division of Veteran Services, and the Idaho 
American legion.

I would like to thank Chairman Miller and members of the Education 
and Labor Committee for their hard work on this legislation.

I urge my colleagues to support the Minnick amendment.

Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
