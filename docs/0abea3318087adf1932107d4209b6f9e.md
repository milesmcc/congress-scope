Mr. CANNON. Thank you, Mr. Peterson. We agree on that point. I think 
that for the first time in maybe our tenure in Congress, we're going to 
see a huge increase in the Natural Resources Committee markup of an 
energy bill to see if we're going to actually drill in ANWR, if we're 
going to drill in the Intercontinental Shelf and loosen up our drilling 
elsewhere around the country.

But that sort of begs the question, right now we're talking about 
various kinds of oil and gas. Let me put some context here.

In our conventional oil resources we have about 50 billion barrels 
that we know about. That includes 10 billion in ANWR. These are in the 
United States of America. We have some oil sands. Those are very 
difficult to develop in America. They're very different from the oil 
sands in Canada where each grain has a little molecule of water so the 
oil comes off the sand with just a little bit of heat.

We have about 100 million barrels of oil on the Outer Continental 
Shelf, and all of that adds up to about 200, 225 million barrels of oil 
that we have available to us today in the United States.

Think about that. 225 barrels of oil. We now have, and I'm going to 
pull up a chart here. We have in oil shale about 1.4, 1.3, let's see, 
that's ''trillion'' barrels of oil. I'm sorry. That's not ''billion'' 
barrels of oil, that's ''trillion'' barrels of oil in Colorado. In 
Utah, we have about 800 million barrels of oil and Wyoming about 500 
million barrels of oil. Those are millions. We're not talking about a 
lousy 225 million barrels in all of our other resources. We're talking 
about 2.6 trillion barrels of oil that are available to America today 
in oil shale.

Now, let's pull up the map, if we can here. This is a map of Utah. 
Idaho is over in the corner, southeast Wyoming and northeast Colorado, 
and you can see the dark green are areas with more intense reserves of 
oil shale and that the lighter green are areas where you have not quite 
as dense oil shale. And these are the areas that have the oil that we 
were just talking about, 1.2 trillion barrels in Wyoming, 800 million 
barrels in Utah. These reserves are different, and the way to get them 
out, the way to get the oil out is going to differ between those.

Let's talk for just a moment about why we can be actually talking 
about producing oil out of shale today whereas it did not work in the 
past.

In the old days, and over here you see on the side it says ''past oil 
shale efforts,'' we used heat to convert kerogen. We broke the shale up 
and put it into a rotary kiln, and then heated it up. The problem is 
you needed enough heat in that rotary kiln to get the kerogen out, but 
at the same time, that was hot enough so that the rock melted into 
itself; and so you would have to shut the operation down occasionally 
and go in with sledge hammers, literally, and knock the rock out that 
had melted into itself.

Today you use chemistry and minimal heat to convert the kerogen to 
oil.

That's a profound difference, and there are about six different 
companies, four large companies and two small companies, that are using 
different kinds of technology to get with a smaller amount of heat to 
convert that kerogen to take it out of the shale. Kerogen, by the way, 
is a lot like diesel fuel and comes out of the system, very close to 
that. Needs to be cleaned up a little bit. It's like JP-8 diesel fuel.

In the old days, we mined this. We had a strip mine or room and 
pillar mining, and then we brought the shale to the surface to be 
processed. Today, the focus is on in situ recovery and conversion.

Back in the day, low-quality energy, intensive product, or low-
quality energy, intensive product to refine; that is you had to put a 
lot of energy in it and it was hard to refine. And today you have high-
quality value product with minimal cost to refine, and then we were 
focused on the resource back then, and now we're focused on balanced 
environmental, technical, and economically sustainable methods.

The fact is we've transformed the way we work technologically in the 
world today, and we can get these resources out of the ground much more 
cheaply.

Let's talk just for a moment about the reserves that we have--or what 
we use imported to the United States and the world's reserves.

The Saudi Arabians have about 264 billion barrels of reserves that we 
know about. Canada has about 179 million or billion barrels of oil, 
Iran has 138, Iraq, 115, and Kuwait 102. And the people that supply 
this oil are Mexico, and these are average barrels per day that we 
import.

So from Canada we import about 2.43 million barrels of oil, from 
Mexico 1.53, from Saudi Arabia 1.49, from Venezuela 1.36, and from 
Nigeria 1.13, and then we import a great deal more from other countries 
who export lesser amounts to us as we go.

These are not exactly the kind of people that we want to be relying 
on except with the exception of Canada perhaps and also to some degree 
Mexico, and that's improving.

And in the last couple minutes we have before we finish this, let me 
just say that this is complicated. The natural resources is complicated 
and the technology is complicated, but we've advanced dramatically in 
our knowledge and understanding of how to do that. We have now, today, 
for the first time in 30 years a commercial test going on here in 
eastern Utah of how to get oil shale out of--oil out of shale, and we 
think that test will be done about September 15, and the projection is 
we will be able to get oil out of shale for $30 a barrel.

Now consider this: Trillions of barrels of oil at about $30 a barrel. 
That's profound. I think that cost is going to actually go lower than 
$30 a barrel, and I'm about to introduce a bill that will allow the 
President to cut through the permitting processes and allow us to 
develop our oil shale at a reasonable time using reasonable 
understanding of the technology and the environmental impacts so that 
we can actually bring that shale to market, bring down the cost of oil, 
stop funding our enemies in Iran and Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and 
start producing oil in America.
