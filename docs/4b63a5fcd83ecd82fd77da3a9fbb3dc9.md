Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, we all urge passage of H.R. 1284, the so-called 
Veterans' Compensation, COLA, Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act. It would 
direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, effective 
December 1 of this year, the rates of veterans' compensation to keep 
pace with the rising cost of living in our Nation. The rate adjustment 
is equal to that provided on an annual basis to Social Security 
recipients and is based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer 
Price Index.

Regardless, Mr. Speaker, of where any of us are on the current war in 
Iraq, we all believe that our returning young men and women who have 
served this Nation so courageously get all the attention, care, respect 
and love that we can give as a Nation. Nothing bothers any of us more 
than to see returning troops, whether it be at Walter Reed or any of 
our VA hospitals, have to face the bureaucracy that seems indifferent, 
and does not provide the services they need.

The cost of serving these veterans, which includes this annual COLA, 
is a continuing cost of war. We will have from Iraq and Afghanistan an 
increase in injuries and disabilities that will yield an increase in 
claims for compensation. Over 1.5 million servicemembers have been 
deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan without any end, it looks like, in 
sight, and the President calls for more troops. Therefore, the Veterans 
Administration, as well as the military hospitals, can expect a 
significant increase in the number of new claims for compensation and 
new demands on the health care system. I think that recent events have 
shown that neither system is adequately prepared for that onslaught, 
and, in fact, the systems are stretched to the breaking point.

We as a Congress, we as a Nation, have got to give our veterans all 
the care that they need, all the resources they need, and we as 
Congress have to provide accountability for the spending of those 
resources.

Let me say that certainly we on the Democratic side, and I am sure 
supported on the Republican side, have made major increases in the 
resources to our veterans care that is now demanded from our Nation. I 
am told that the budget resolution will have an additional $6.6 billion 
over what we appropriated last year for the Veterans Administration.

You know that we appropriated an additional $3.6 billion for fiscal 
year 2007, the year that we are in now, in the so-called continuing 
resolution, the biggest increase of any department in that continuing 
resolution.

The supplemental that we will be considering at the end of this week 
has $3.5 billion for military and veterans health care: we say if you 
are going to deal with the cost of war, deal with the costs of the 
warrior.

So just in 60 days, Mr. Speaker, the new majority in the Congress has 
provided an additional $13.5 billion for the care of our Nation's 
veterans, and that is a bigger increase than was totaled in the last 5 
years combined.

So I think we are responding to the Walter Reed scandal. We are 
responding to the tragic suicides that came from indifference from the 
bureaucracy. We are responding to the needs of traumatic brain injury 
that have so increased in this war. We are responding to the needs of 
those who have post-traumatic stress disorder. We are responding to the 
needs of a Veterans Administration that is backlogged 600,000 
disability claims.

So we are going to respond with the dollars. We also need to make 
sure we have accountability, and we will have more to say on that in 
the future.

Congress regularly enacts an annual cost-of-living adjustment for 
veterans compensation to make sure that inflation does not erode the 
purchasing power of veterans and their families who depend upon this 
income to meet their daily needs. This bill before us, in


fact, will benefit all veterans from the World War I era through the 
current conflicts.

So I hope that we will have support for this. I would like to add my 
thanks for the increases that I talked about just a second ago in this 
budget for 2008 and the continuing resolution for 2007 and the 
supplemental that we will be considering to our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, 
who insisted that we care for our Nation's veterans; also, the chairman 
of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey of Wisconsin; to his chairman 
of the subcommittee that looks at veterans affairs, Mr. Edwards from 
Texas; and the chairman of our Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt, all of 
whom said we are not going to fail this test that America is faced with 
today, the test of whether we are going to make sure that our veterans 
get the care they need

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
