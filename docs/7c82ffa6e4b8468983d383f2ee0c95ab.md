Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this Democratic Congress has been successful 
in raising the minimum wage with help from people on the other side of 
the aisle, and the President signed that into law.

It has also passed stem cell research with some help from people on 
the other side of the aisle. The President has threatened to veto that 
bill and that's unfortunate.

The biggest issue hanging over this Congress is the war in Iraq; and 
while this Congress has made moves to have timetables and benchmarks, 
it hasn't achieved a consensus that the President will agree to and 
effectuate policy that brings our troops home.

It will take colleagues on the other side of the aisle, people who 
have been wedded to this war, President Bush's war, and have been 
unable to get themselves derailed from that train that's on a collision 
course. Until Republicans come forward and heed America's call to bring 
our troops home, more and more Americans will die in Iraq, more and 
more American dollars will be spent in Iraq where they shouldn't be.

We need to redeploy our troops to fight terrorists in Afghanistan and 
other places and keep our country safe. I ask my Republican colleagues, 
Mr. Speaker, to join us.
