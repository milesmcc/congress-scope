Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Let's really look at what we are talking about. It is important to 
note that the amendment allows the Secretary of Defense to classify 
videotapes. Under the existing rules--by the way, there are three 
theater internment facilities in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. Under 
those rules, one can only be held 14 days. But any interrogation 
between the time of capture and the time a person is entered in the 
theater internment facility does not have to be videotaped.
