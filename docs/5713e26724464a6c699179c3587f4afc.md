Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of the 
men and women of the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division of 
the Minnesota National Guard and in strong support of H. Con. Res. 185.

I want to thank my colleague and friend Tim Walz for bringing this 
important resolution before the floor.

The dedicated men and women of 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry 
Division of the Minnesota Guard have just finished serving the longest 
continuous deployment of any United States military unit during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. This Minnesota National Guard unit served 22 
months, 16 of which were in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I believe our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to the 
members of the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division along 
with all the men and women who have honorably served in Iraq.

H. Con. Res. 185 represents a small token of appreciation for our 
grateful Nation. The resolution formally recognizes the achievements of 
these citizen soldiers and officially thanks them for their service.



This resolution thanks the 1st Brigade Combat Team for their work and 
the time they have sacrificed from their families, neighbors and 
communities in their valiant service to our country.

I urge my fellow colleagues in Congress to support this important 
resolution.
