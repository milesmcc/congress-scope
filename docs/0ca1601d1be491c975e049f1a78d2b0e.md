Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we can proceed to this bill. This is 
another bipartisan piece of legislation. Senators Boxer and Inhofe have 
worked on this bill for months and months. It has been very difficult. 
It has been like pulling teeth. They get one thing done and something 
else crops up. It is now done.

I hope we can move to this bill. If there are those who want to offer 
an amendment, good. Let them offer an amendment. This is something that 
is important and we need to do. I hope, recognizing this bill relates 
to the highway bill that we passed 3/1/2/ years ago, any amendments 
offered would be in keeping with the content of the bill. I don't want 
to get off on Iraq or some tax issue. I hope we can confine it to this 
legislation.

This is the Senate. After we get on the bill, I hope we could go 
immediately to it; we wouldn't have to use the 30 hours. If there are 
things that need to be done, no one is trying to stop anybody from 
offering amendments. We are not going to be, unless there is a change, 
and I will certainly give lots of prior warning to the Republican 
leader after we are on this a while. I hope we can just go through the 
ordinary process, that we don't have to do any parliamentary maneuvers 
to get this very important bipartisan piece of legislation done.
