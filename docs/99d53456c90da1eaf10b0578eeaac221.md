`Mr. LEVIN â€” 24 May 2007`

---


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I continue to believe that Congress must 
act to change course in Iraq because the Bush administration will not. 
Congress needs to force the Iraqi political leaders to accept 
responsibility for their country's future. Four years of painful 
history have shown that the only way to accomplish that goal is to 
write into law a requirement that we reduce the number of U.S. troops 
in Iraq beginning in 120 days. That amount of time would give the Iraqi 
leaders the time to make the political settlements that are the only 
hope of ending the sectarian fighting.

Setting that beginning point would also force the Iraqi leaders to 
face the reality that we will not be their endless security blanket. 
That approach got 51 votes in the Senate on March 29. It was sent to 
the President. The President vetoed it. But pressure continues to build 
for a change in course, even in the President's party.

We will renew the effort to force a change in course in June when we 
take up the Defense authorization bill currently scheduled for late 
June. The way we will do that is we will make and renew the effort to 
require the President to begin reducing American troops in Iraq within 
120 days.

I voted against the authorization to attack Iraq 4 years ago, and I 
will continue to fight for a bill that forces the President to do the 
one thing which will successfully change course in Iraq. Reducing our 
presence starting in 120 days is a way of telling the Iraqi leaders 
that we cannot save them from themselves and that only they can make 
the decision as to whether they want an all-out civil war or they want 
a nation.

I cannot vote, however, to stop funding for our troops who are in 
harm's way. I simply cannot, and I will not do that. It is not the 
proper way we can bring this war to an end. It is not the proper way we 
can put pressure on the Iraqi leaders. It is a way of sending the wrong 
message to our troops because now that they are there, and now that 
they are in harm's way, I believe we must give them all of the support 
they need.

It is not only the absence from this bill of a beginning point for 
troop reductions, which is so troubling, I am also concerned about the 
benchmarks in this bill because they are not only toothless, they may 
actually be counterproductive. Benchmarks with no consequences for 
failure to achieve them will not put the necessary pressure on the 
Iraqi leaders to reach a political settlement. Only a law requiring the 
reduction of our troops can do that.

The benchmarks as written in this bill are doubly problematic because 
the schedule for reports, July 15 and September 15, could be used as a 
way of forestalling pressure on the administration and the Iraqi 
leaders since those reports are not due until after we are planning to 
take up the Defense authorization bill in June.

Perhaps the supporters of the current course in Iraq will say that 
those of us voting to fund the troops bill before us are also signing 
on to the toothless benchmarks with their arguably momentum-slowing 
requirements. So let me say plainly, I oppose the benchmarks and the 
reports as provided for in this bill.

Well, let me say plainly: I oppose the toothless benchmarks and 
momentum-delaying reports in this bill. I agree


with the Iraq Study Group that continued U.S. military support for Iraq 
''depends on the Iraqi government's demonstrating political will and 
making substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on 
national reconciliation, security and governance.''

It has been clear for a long time that there is no military solution 
in Iraq and that an Iraqi political settlement is necessary if there is 
a chance of ending the violence in Iraq.

Most telling, perhaps, was Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's 
acknowledgement of this essential point when he stated in November:




 The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the 


 cycle . . . of bloodletting of innocents are the [Iraqi] 


 politicians.


Apparently, the Iraqi leaders, however, will realize that their 
future is in their hands only when they are forced into that 
recognition. That is one of the many reasons that we must pass a law 
requiring our President to begin reducing U.S. troops in Iraq in 120 
days. We will continue our efforts to do so when the Defense 
authorization bill is before us.

The Washington Post reported yesterday that General Petraeus and 
Ambassador Crocker are working on a new strategy in Iraq. According to 
the Washington Post: ''The end of 2008, is more political than 
military: to negotiate settlements between warring factions in Iraq 
from the national level down to the local level. In essence, it is as 
much about the political deals needed to defuse a civil war as about 
the military operations aimed at quelling a complex insurgency, said 
officials with knowledge of the plan.''
