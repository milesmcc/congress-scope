`Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts â€” 20 March 2007`

Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds 
to say I agree with the gentleman that we should not be spending a lot 
more money where it has been badly spent. Also, I did not think we were 
going to be talking about Iraq until later in the week.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Baca).

(Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
