Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I wanted to take a moment to recognize a 
great American, a constituent of mine from Bayonne, New Jersey, Dr. 
Jack Smith.

After seeing the second plane hit the World Trade Center on 9/11, Dr. 
Smith immediately left his Bayonne practice and went to help treat 
victims in Lower Manhattan. He said he felt the world had changed that 
day, and he decided to enlist in the Army Medical Reserve at the age of 
49 years old.

Dr. Smith has since served two tours overseas. He was sent on his 
first tour to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan where he served in the 
325th Combat Support Hospital Unit. His second tour was with the First 
Squadron of the 167th RSTA Cavalry Unit in Iraq. There he worked at the 
battalion aid station, the Air Force Theatre Hospital, and gave medical 
support for two intelligence gathering missions outside the wire.

When asked about managing his service, family, and practice, Dr. 
Smith says he's been blessed. I believe we are blessed to have 
individuals like Dr. Smith serving our country. His courage and service 
are an example to us all, and I want to thank him and his family for 
his service.
