Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, February 18, 2010, Indiana lost 
one of its brave sons. Marine Sergeant Jeremy McQueary was killed in 
the Helmand Province, Afghanistan, by an IED while on foot patrol 
supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. Sergeant McQueary, a Columbus, 
Indiana, native, had survived two prior IED attacks while in 
Afghanistan.

Jeremy, a model Hoosier, enjoyed fishing, four wheeling and giving 
back to his community by mentoring troubled high school students. He 
married his high school sweetheart, Rae, and together they had a baby 
boy, Hadley. He was only a month old when Jeremy shipped out for his 
third tour, this time to Afghanistan, having already served two 
previous tours in Iraq.

Eager to join the Marine Corps, Jeremy graduated from high school 
early and enlisted in 2002. Jeremy's passion for the Corps was so 
strong that he completed basic training on a broken foot, informing his 
superiors of his injury only after he had finished basic training. This 
level of commitment shown by Jeremy to the Corps and our country is an 
example to us all.

Jeremy McQueary was a devoted father and family man who paid the 
ultimate sacrifice serving his country. I mourn the loss of Jeremy. I 
want to thank Jeremy and his family for his service to our country. He 
and his loved ones are in my prayers.
