`Mr. MURTHA â€” 15 May 2008`

Mr. MURTHA. Well, as Bill Young said, we worked together when he was 
chairman. When Jerry was chairman, we worked together.

The only thing I disagree with, when it comes to the floor, I am not 
sure I like to hear a lot about amendments. I mean, you know, I like to 
see it try to work in a hurry.

But, anyway, I am concerned, when I heard the other day the Secretary 
of Defense say that the United States military must prepare for more 
fighting, future wars against insurgents and militias, such as in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, rather than spend money and time preparing for 
conventional conflicts.

Overemphasizing the Department's focus on training and equipment for 
counterinsurgency missions appears to be simply a rationalization of a 
short-term budget decision made in the waning months of this 
administration. I am worried because we have been saying over and over 
again, let's look beyond Iraq, let's make sure we get the military back 
to the position where it should be.

These decisions have left the Armed Forces in a degraded state of 
readiness. Both of us, when Jerry was chairman, when Bill was chairman, 
we have tried to increase the amount of money for the military to 
increase our readiness without the support of the administration in 
many cases.

They have let the facilities, which directly impact service 
personnel, quality of life, in disrepair. Every place we have gone we 
have seen the disrepair. They have left many defense acquisition 
programs broken or badly damaged.

I sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense saying, Mr. Secretary, we 
have got some real problems here. We have got to fix these procedures 
by sending a budget up to it. We have got to stop the supplementals, 
put it in one budget so we can have some semblance of order when we 
look at these decisions. These decisions fail to take into account the 
potential missions the U.S. armed forces must prepare for and may have 
to undertake in the years ahead.

I find these comments questionable that he has made at a time when 
not one combat unit in the United States is rated as combat ready. We 
need a national strategy. We have tried to provide a national strategy 
to identify both near term and long-term threats to this country. We 
need a vigorous debate to achieve this strategy, and it hasn't happened 
since the Cold War.

Now, I hope that in the base bill and this supplemental we are moving 
in that direction. I hope that's what we are going to be able to 
accomplish.

Now, we spend more money on intelligence than any other country in 
the world. Put them all together, and we spend more money. I have got 
Punxsutawney Phil in my district. Punxsutawney Phil comes out once a 
year, he sees his shadow, and 50 percent of the time he is right.

Well, I will tell you, I wouldn't say that the intelligence effort 
that we spend so much money on is any more than that, because so many 
things have not been right.

I am concerned that if we don't pay attention to what we know, we who 
have been here a long time, we are not going to be prepared not only to 
fight a war, but to prevent a war. We can no longer be the world's 
policeman, and I think all of us understand that.

We need to rebuild our diplomatic alliances, and we need to restore 
our international credibility. Our military and diplomatic force must 
include the strengths of our allies. We cannot do it alone.

Now, let me say in this bill we have $3.6 billion for C-17s. We 
produced 34 C-130s. We went through it with the subcommittee in detail. 
We had to make some changes because the full committee wanted us to 
make some changes, $3 billion for medium and heavy trucks. I remember 
when we went to Saudi Arabia the first time, we asked General 
Schwarzkopf, what was the biggest shortage, and he said trucks.

We have tried to take care of the things we realize need to be done. 
We put money in for Humvees and Marine Corps facility maintenance, and 
we put in for medical maintenance. We transferred money to the military 
construction committee, and they made the decision where that money 
should go--and $570 billion--no one in Congress, probably in the 
history of Congress, paid more attention to medical care for the 
military than Mr. Lewis, Mr. Young and myself. We have tried to be in 
the forefront in making sure that they have what they need in order to 
take care of the troops.




As a matter of fact, we put money in some years ago for a center to 
take care of the amputees, and it took them awhile to understand that 
we were serious about it, but it happened. I am proud to say that is 
working very effectively.

So what we have done under the Constitution is appropriate the money 
where we think it will do the most good, and we will continue to do 
that. This is a good bill, and I hope Members vote for it so we can get 
the money to the troops that they need.
