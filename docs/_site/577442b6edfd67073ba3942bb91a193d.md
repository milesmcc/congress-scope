`Mr. STUPAK â€” 23 April 2008`

---


Mr. STUPAK. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.

I am proud to come to the floor to talk about solutions that the 
Democratic Party has put forth and this House has tackled in the last 
year. But let's not try to rewrite history, as we see being done on the 
other side.

Let's remember when President Bush came to office in 2001, crude oil 
sold at $25.88 a barrel. When the Iraq war began, that terrible, 
misguided war, crude oil was $35 a barrel. Gas was approximately $1.56. 
In my district today, gas is $3.56. Crude oil is over $119. That is 
what the Republican policies have brought us, a bad war and gas and oil 
that we cannot afford.

The Energy Information Agency says gas will be $4 this summer. Diesel 
is already $4. So what have the GOP and this President said they are 
going to


do? Remember? He is going to jawbone his friends the Saudis to produce 
more oil so we would have it here in this country.

Oh, he jawboned all right. He jawboned all the way up to record 
prices, record profits, where ExxonMobil can pay its CEO a $400 million 
pension with $44 billion in profits last year. Oh, boy, they jawboned 
all right. Their jawbone is chewing on our pocketbook and is hurting 
the middle class in this country.

What have we done? The energy price gouging bill, H.R. 1252, which we 
passed last May 284-141. One hundred forty-one on the other side 
wouldn't even vote for us to stop the gouging of prices that we see day 
in and day out. This legislation would have provided the Federal Trade 
Commission with the authority to investigate and prosecute those who 
engage in price gouging, predatory pricing and other unfair practices.

I don't know about you, but I am tired of seeing gas go up 30 cents 
like it did earlier this month in my district. One day, 30 cents. Now, 
if that is not excessive pricing, predatory price gouging, I don't know 
what it is.

Let's take a look at the PUMP Act, a piece of legislation we have 
been working on since April of 2006, and we have plenty of cosponsors. 
We had a hearing last December, December 12. What did they say? Pass 
the PUMP Act to prevent the unfair manipulation of prices. Professor 
Greenberg said we could save $30 a barrel. For every barrel of oil that 
comes into this country, we can save $30 by getting the speculators out 
of the market.

Why do we continue to allow speculators to run this country? They 
sure did a good job with mortgages, didn't they, with the subprime 
mortgages. That is why the values of our properties have gone down. Now 
the speculators are in the oil field, in the energy field. And why is 
that? Because of a little thing when the Republicans were in charge 
called the Enron loophole. The Enron loophole in 2005 allowed the 
speculators to come into the energy field, and therefore they have run 
up the price. What did the hearings show?
