Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. We will certainly accede to his 
request. I would like to tell my colleagues that I do not intend to 
conclude debate on this legislation until such time as we have straight 
up-or-down votes on the two amendments about which I talked. One is 
striking the funding for the C-17, $2.5 billion and adding $2.5 billion 
for operations and maintenance. I will be glad to discuss it with the 
managers of the bill how that sequence will take place, how much 
debate. I do not intend to hold up the bill in any way. I just wish to 
tell my colleagues I want consideration and recorded votes on both of 
those amendments.

What we have done tonight by not waiving the budget, the rule, is an 
outrage and is going to damage very badly the men and women who are 
serving this country because we are not giving them the equipment they 
need to operate in harm's way--120,000 of them in Iraq, 68,000 of them 
in Afghanistan. That is the opinion of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, General Petraeus, General McChrystal, and the Secretary of 
Defense. It is a remarkable moment--a remarkable moment--in the history 
of the Senate, although I have seen it happen before. Congratulations 
to the lobbyists from Boeing. I yield the floor.
