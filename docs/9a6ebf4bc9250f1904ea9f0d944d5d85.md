`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 25 June 2007`

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting that you would 
say that, and I can definitely share with you that we have to put a 
face on this issue.

Mr. Speaker, I know time after time again there are some Members that 
are concerned that we may have a single focus on Iraq, and that is not 
the case. We are moving the House. We have appropriation bills that are 
moving through the process. We have legislation. We have the 9/11 
legislation coming up this week. The Senate is fast at work, doing work 
before we leave on Friday. It is important to put a face on this.

I said before, Iraq, Iraq, and that other issue, Iraq. But look what 
it is doing to the country. Look where it is holding up the resources; 
where it is taking up so much of our time, not only of the Congress, 
rightfully so, because our troops are in harm's way.

We have a President that is saying ''troops will be in Iraq,'' he 
said this in the past, ''troops will be in Iraq as long as I am 
President.'' ''We will be in Iraq,'' saying ''we.''

This is the first time he has not had a rubber stamp Congress since 
he has been President. I think it is important that our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle, those that have to vote with their 
constituents and for their constituents, make sure we can work towards 
measures in getting our men and women out.

But to punt the ball down and say, well, let's try on the next series 
of downs, we have to actually try to run the ball on fourth down. 
Running the ball on fourth down is having not only American families 
that are affected by this war in Iraq, but those that are not, letting 
their Members of Congress know that enough is enough.

Now, let me share this with you. We are going to fight the policy 
battle and we are going to make sure that our men and women have what 
they need to have that are in harm's way. That is


a no-brainer. I have never run into an American or even received a 
letter that says ''I encourage you not to support the troops.'' Or ''I 
don't support the troops.'' You never hear that. You always hear people 
support the troops.

The policy is an entirely different issue, and I think it is very 
important to say time after time again that to move in a new direction, 
that is the what the American people wanted last November, is being 
able to have not only the guts, but the integrity to move in that 
direction.

It is beyond good government. It is making a commitment to those who 
have made a commitment to us. And they are counting on us to stand up. 
And when I say us, I am not talking just about good Democrats. I am not 
just talking about Republicans. I am talking about all Members of the 
House.

The reason why it is very difficult, Mr. Larson, as you know, to move 
the kind of legislation that we would like to move through this 
process, is because in the Senate they need a number of votes to be 
able to do so, 60 votes, I think that is the number.

Here in the House, the majority is not all that big, even though we 
are in the majority. I know that the record speaks for itself, and 
before we leave here tonight, I am going to read what I read a week ago 
into the Congressional Record about the accomplishments of this 
Congress and what we have done as it relates to this issue of Iraq and 
where we have run into a roadblock with the President on not only 
vetoing legislation, with the help of our Republican colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle that have been standing with the President.

I would like, if I can, I don't know if my chart is on the floor, Mr. 
Larson, I had this chart with the President on it and the Republican 
Congress, where they borrowed so much money. I want to have a prop so I 
can make the point even clearer to the Members.
