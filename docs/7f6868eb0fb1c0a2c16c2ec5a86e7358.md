Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of two 
heroic brothers, Ryan and Aaron Job, constituents of the 8th District 
of Washington State, whose time spent in defense and service of our 
Nation are both inspirational and incredible. Both served under 
harrowing conditions in Iraq and are two fine examples of the young men 
and women who serve in our Armed Forces.

Aaron, who signed up for the Marine Corps before his senior year at 
Skyline High School in Sammamish, Washington, in 2001, served two tours 
in Iraq. He participated in the invasion of Iraq in early 2003 and he, 
along with his Marine Corps comrades, renovated schools and medical 
clinics, dredged water canals and helped build six new markets. Before 
returning home from his second tour of duty, he helped oversee the 
first free elections in Iraq in early 2005 while in Najaf. Najaf is 
also where he suffered shrapnel wounds to his hand and narrowly escaped 
insurgent sniper fire. Once home, he served in Mississippi in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina with his fellow Marines.

Ryan, who was nearing the end of Navy Seal training when Aaron was 
ending his second tour, was on patrol in Ramadi in 2006 when sniper 
fire hit the rifle he was holding and severely damaged both of his 
eyes, leaving him permanently blind. His lack of sight did not stop him 
from recently climbing Mt. Rainier, a 14,441 foot mountain.

Throughout their service, Ryan and Aaron's commitment to God and 
Country never wavered. With selflessness, courage and resiliency, Ryan 
and Aaron served our country admirably and this entire body is grateful 
for their sacrifice.
