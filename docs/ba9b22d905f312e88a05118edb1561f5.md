Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the Iraqis are 
deciding now to start to defend themselves. I think it is wonderful. I 
wish it had happened a number of years ago.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5/1/4/ minutes to the gentlewoman from South 
Dakota, a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Representative 
Stephanie Herseth.
