`Mr. GINGREY â€” 7 February 2007`

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for 
yielding.

And I want to take just a second to join my colleagues from Georgia 
and particularly the two that are on the floor tonight, Dr. Price and 
Representative Westmoreland, in saying to our colleague Charlie Norwood 
that we are praying for you, buddy. All of us from Georgia, but every 
Member of this body on both sides of the aisle are praying that the 
miracle of God's healing will deliver you back to us soon, and we think 
about you constantly.

Mr. Speaker, this hour is a great opportunity for us to discuss the 
budget. And I had an opportunity this morning to be on the C-SPAN 
program, and the host said to me, Congressman, are you aware of the 
fact that one of the Members of the other body has recommended that 
maybe we need something called a war tax to pay for our Operations 
Iraqi and Enduring Freedom? And I said to the host, I know that has 
probably been done in the history of this country. Maybe it was 
necessary to fund a previous war. But the thing about this President 
and this administration is because of these economic principles of 
cutting taxes and growing revenue, fortunately, Mr. Speaker, we have 
been able to do this without raising the people's taxes. And I 
certainly commend President Bush for that foresight and wisdom and the 
former majority party as we supported those tax cuts when it was 
predicted that it would cost the economy over a 10-year period 
something like $1.3 trillion.

So what I would like to say to my friends on the other side of the 
aisle in particular as I wrap up quickly, and I know time is limited, 
on the defense budget, please, please do not cut future combat systems. 
Don't cut our missile defense system to pay for some social programs 
when the defense of this Nation is so important at this time of war.

With that, I really appreciate my colleague giving me the opportunity 
to weigh in tonight.
