`Mr. REID â€” 7 June 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have worked long and hard on this piece 
of legislation. It is a very complicated bill, as it should be, because 
we have a complicated problem--that is immigration. We have come a long 
way since we started the debate on this matter. It is fresh in my mind 
what went on last year when we had the debate on an immigration bill 
that passed the Senate. Last year we worked long and hard. We had 23 
rollcall votes prior to cloture. Seven amendments in addition to that 
were done by voice vote last year. Postcloture, we had 3 that went by 
voice, there were 11 that were voted on.



This year we have had 28 rollcall votes on amendments. We have had 14 
amendments by voice, a total of 42 amendments. So we are way ahead of 
where we were last year.

I understand that people were concerned yesterday about not having 
enough amendments. I think everyone had an opportunity to offer 
amendments. But it is interesting--we had people who were saying: This 
amendment that passed is a deal breaker. On the other side: We had an 
amendment that passed that is a deal breaker. So I guess whether a bill 
is improved is in the eye of the beholder because there was certainly 
disagreement about what improved or didn't improve the bill. I also 
think it is interesting people agitated for amendments and then, when 
the vote didn't go their way, they were upset.

This is a bill we have pushed down the road a long way. I hope we can 
finish it. I spoke last night--I don't know what time it was, it was 
4:30 a.m. European time. I called to see if Mr. Bolton, the President's 
Chief of Staff, was with the President. He was. I didn't want to 
disturb him at that time of day. But I did have a good long 
conversation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, Judge Chertoff. 
That was 10:30, 11 o'clock last night. I explained to him how this 
legislative process works. He asked me to go over it with him again 
because he wanted to make sure he understood it.

I told him, as much as any piece of legislation we have had here--
other than the supplemental appropriations bill this past 6 months--
this is the President's bill. He has worked long and hard. He has had 
Cabinet officers working with Democrats and Republicans to come up with 
a bill, the so-called compromise. Some call it a grand compromise, but 
it is at least a compromise. I told him the vast majority of Democrats 
want this legislation to move forward. I think someone should get word 
to the President that, if this bill goes down with the vast majority of 
the Democrats voting for this action to move forward--if the 
Republicans vote against it, he and I discussed what the headline is 
going to be. The headline is going to be: Democrats Vote To Continue 
This Bill, the Republicans Vote Against It--The President Fails Again.

I don't think that is good. I think we need to show we have the 
ability to work with the White House.

I know there are some people who would like us to stay on immigration 
for the rest of this work period. We have 3 weeks left. It would make 
some people as happy as larks to be able to spend the rest of this work 
period on immigration. Why? Because some don't want us to go to the 
next two matters we are going to have to deal with.

No. 1 is energy. When we went home during the Memorial Day break, 
there were two things people wanted to talk to me about. One of them 
wasn't immigration. The Iraq war and gas prices, that is what people 
wanted to talk about wherever I went. I spent a lot of time in Nevada, 
but I traveled to other places in the country. It was the same there: 
Iraq, end this war, and do something about these gas prices.

We are going to take up energy. That will be what we do after we do 
the immigration bill. So I know some people don't want us to go there. 
After we finish that, we have the obligation to do, for our military 
and our country, a Defense authorization bill. Again, there will be a 
debate on Iraq. I am sure some will want to talk about timelines. I am 
sure some will want to talk about readiness. I am sure there will be 
people wanting to talk about transitioning the mission. Maybe there 
will be some efforts to do away with the original authorization of the 
war. I don't know for sure. That is an issue some people would just as 
soon we stay away from.

I know people would like us to stay on this forever, but the question 
is, When is enough enough?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be 
delayed to occur today at 5 p.m.
