`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 4 September 2007`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the President 
visited our troops in Anbar province, Iraq. Along with his message of 
continued resolve to stop enemies, he brought with him the thoughts and 
prayers of a grateful Nation.

We are blessed to have the new Greatest Generation who are 
sacrificing to protect American families by promoting freedom to 
millions around the world. Their dedication to duty should inspire us 
all. We must honor their hard work by ensuring that they have our 
support and the resources to complete the mission.

In the coming days, Congress will hear from General David Petraeus 
and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about conditions on the ground. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in welcoming their recommendations and 
listening with an open mind.

Just as our soldiers have the courage to stop our enemies, so should 
we have the strength to make the right decisions that will ensure the 
safety of our troops and stop additional terrorist attacks on America.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th.
