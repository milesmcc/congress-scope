Petersburg, FL 33710

Description of Request: Provides $1,000,000 for the Advanced 
Conductivity Program (ACP). The United States Army has recognized the 
need for the manufacture of advanced nanotechnology film materials. 
These films reduce solar loading of vehicles and are transparent; 
electrically and thermally conductive and flexible; thereby enhancing 
the transparent and armor capability of avionic window systems. This 
allows the soldier increased situational awareness, survivability and 
effectiveness on the battlefield.

Advanced Detection of Explosives (ADE)

electronic sensor components. These components will be used in large-
scale phased array antenna architectures and other passive 
electromagnetic and EO/IR sensor arrays. These modular components for 
DC powered devices and critical power components effectively 
militarized will also support other highly integrated sensor arrays 
across the military services--air, space, ship, and shore assets.

AN/AAR-47B(V)2 Missile Warning System

Account: United States Navy, Aircraft Procurement

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Alliant Techsystems (ATK), Inc.

Address of Requesting Entity: 13133 34th Street North, Clearwater FL 
33762

Description of Request: $5,000,000 will be provided for the United 
States Navy for advancements in the AN/AAR-47B(V)2 Missile Warning 
System. The AN/AAR-47B(V)2 Missile Warning System is an extremely 
effective, low cost, missile warning system that provides significant 
timely warning of missile and laser threats to U.S. aircraft. This 
program will provide upgrades for new requirements based on emerging 
threats in the Global War on Terrorism, and it will address long-term 
performance improvements for emerging threats. This system is currently 
fielded in a wide variety of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft 
currently being used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The lessons learned from 
years of combat operations and subsequent upgrades to this system which 
would enhance the ability of the aircraft to avoid being shot down.

computer interface and encryption capabilities to protect command and 
control and sensor communications.

Battlefield Sensor Netting (BSN)

Account: United States Navy/Marine Corps, RDT&E

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: SAIC

Address of Requesting Entity: Central Avenue, Suite 1370, St. 
Petersburg, FL 33701

Description of Request: $3,000,000 for the United States Navy for the 
continuation of development for Battlefield Sensor Netting (BSN). BSN 
will provide the warfighter with unparalleled access to mission 
critical, real-time sensor data. Although tremendous progress has been 
made in the advancement of sensors, there has not been a corresponding 
advancement in data link network technologies that can effectively 
disseminate, display and exploit the tremendous amounts of data 
generated by modern sensor systems. The Battlefield Sensor Netting 
program bridges the sensor to shooter gap. It would provide a high 
bandwidth data network that combines the advantages of low cost, highly 
capable commercial wireless technologies with the extended range, 
jamming resistance and security provided by phased array antennas, 
military encryption systems and network software.

Advanced Development of CBRN Detection Payload for Unmanned Rotary 
Wing Aircraft

Account: United States Department of Defense, Defense Wide, RDT&E/DW

Description of Request: $2,000,000 for the Department of Defense to 
conduct a competition for the development of an Advanced Development of 
CBRN Detection Payload for Unmanned Rotary Wing Aircraft. The New 
rotary wing unmanned aircraft offers many key benefits for CBRN 
detection in that they are capable of staying near a potential source 
(hovering) for extended periods. This effort is designed to take the 
lessons learned from fixed wing aircraft and develop a CBRN detection 
payload for rotary wing aircraft. Rotary wing aircraft offer a great 
potential improvement in the ability to detect CBRN from the air. The 
Rotary Wing UAV platforms are expected to be a more proficient means in 
addressing payload considerations associated with detector technology 
in the detection of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

Comprehensive Maritime Domain Awareness

successful program to detect, deter or prevent terrorist attacks 
against our ports as well as support a broad group of local and 
regional law enforcement agencies, national and defense assets tasked 
with protecting ports, waterways, and the general maritime commerce. 
The program is developing a comprehensive, networked, waterside and 
landside port and maritime domain awareness system. The initiative 
applies the latest available technology and develops new capabilities 
to fill deficiencies in existing systems. Technology used to support 
the effort takes advantage of the latest advances in micro-systems and 
nano-materials for sensors and communications.

Additional research and development funding will support critical anti-
tamper upgrades to safeguard CEC technology and modify the CEC 
algorithms to support fleet defense against emerging threats. The anti-
tamper upgrades will allow CEC technology to be used by our closest 
allies (the U.K. and Australia; also possibly Canada), thereby 
fostering an interoperability between our navies.

Chemical and Biological Controls--Rapid Response. This project assists 
the Department of Defense to primarily focus in two important medical 
areas: (1) numerous sub-project investigations, studies and research 
which has led to the development of recognized diagnostics and vaccines 
that are used to treat infectious diseases and more rapid response to 
chemical and biological agents such as anthrax, and (2) a highly 
successful program of training and education for first responders both 
in and outside of Florida. Over 3,500 persons (law enforcement 
officers, firefighters, medical personnel and the media, to name a few) 
have been trained to act quickly and efficiently in the event of a 
terrorist attack or natural disaster condition which necessitates the 
highest level of productivity to protect affected communities.

diseases occurring from battlefield experiences and exposure to 
multiple hazards. This project singularly focuses on specific molecular 
determinants of that threat and new research to lead to effective drug 
discovery treatments. The project also focuses on delivery and 
deployment of therapies directly to military personnel. This area of 
research is under funded in the U.S. military at present and is a 
growing and compelling need to protect our service members from long-
term disability and death.
