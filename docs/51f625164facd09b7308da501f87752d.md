Ms. LANDRIEU. We are spending $8.6 billion a month in Iraq, which is 
$286 million a day. In this bill, we are asking the gulf coast to have 
10 days--10 days of funding for the troops who are fighting in Iraq who 
lost their homes in the gulf coast. I don't think it is excessive. I 
ask the President to rethink his veto policy.
