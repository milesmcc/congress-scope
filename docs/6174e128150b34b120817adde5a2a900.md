Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Afghanistan 
Freedom Support Act and to thank the chairman and the ranking member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee for this bipartisan bill.

H.R. 2446 provides for reconstruction and reconciliation. It provides 
for the future of Afghan people by supporting women's rights, 
supporting education, agricultural initiatives and civil society 
reform.

Actually, this bill is doing what we could and what we should do in 
Iraq. It builds a path, a true path to peace. With H.R. 2446, through 
economic political and reconstruction support, we can help rebuild a 
nation. We can provide hope for a safe and prosperous future for 
another nation. And we can also learn from this bill, learn that 
democracy and stability come from international partnerships, not from 
guns, not from bombs.
