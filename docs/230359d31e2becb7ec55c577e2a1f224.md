Mr. JEFFERSON. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

Madam Speaker, this is a very important subject on which we speak 
tonight. Most of what needs to be said has already been said by Members 
who have gone before me, and I know the time is short.

However, I want to say a couple of things. I have had the privilege 
of serving in the military of our country. I was first commissioned as 
a military intelligence officer and then commissioned in the JAG Corps 
as a judge advocate general officer. I take it seriously when the 
Commander in Chief says we need to protect ourselves and defend our 
country.

I have a district full of veterans. We have a large port facility 
that is vulnerable to attack and penetration. I had long talks with 
Colin Powell about these issues, and they were all very persuasive and 
convincing about what we needed to do to protect ourselves.

I thought back about what we did when President Clinton came to us 
about Bosnia and Kosovo when he told us that we needed to give him 
authority to do what we needed to do to protect our country. I thought 
it was fair to treat both Commanders in Chief the same. We should not 
play politics over this issue. If we needed to protect our country, we 
should.

We all know now there were no weapons of mass destruction, no 
justification for the war, no nuclear weapons could be found there. 
Nothing that the President told us was true was true. Whether he 
intended or not, as has been said, the information was untrue; and, 
therefore, we should not have based the war on it.

The other thing that is important is that most of us who voted on the 
resolution decided and expected that the resolution would be followed. 
Number one, that the President would go to the U.N. and talk to folks 
and try to get a consensus.

And number two, that he would only go when there was a consensus 
reached. He really just raced right past the U.N. and went right to 
war, from the very beginning violating the obligations and trust he 
asked us to repose in him.

Now we are in the middle of a civil war, and we are asked now to add 
more troops, add a surge and escalate our efforts there. I don't 
believe that the American people want to see that done. I surely can't 
support that at this point down the road.

As we look at what we need to do in our country, there is so much 
that needs to be done. I happen to represent a district that was 
inundated by flood waters, not because of a natural disaster only, but 
because the Corps of Engineers, a U.S. Government agency, failed to 
protect our people and built levees that were not designed properly, 
that were not constructed properly and that were not maintained 
properly. Consequently, they failed and our city drowned.

It is time for our government to face up to domestic 
responsibilities, particularly for Hurricane Katrina. And all of the 
money that we are going to spend now on a surge in Iraq, I would like 
to see a great part of it spent to bring our people home and restore 
our communities and rebuild back the confidence that people ought to 
have in us right here in America.

Madam Speaker and Congresswoman Waters, all of you who have done so 
much in this area, I thank you for giving me a chance to come here and 
say these few words tonight. I know our time is very short.

But I want to see our emphasis placed on our domestic responsibility 
now in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. That is where our country 
needs to focus.

If it was the Iraq war, after the wheels came off the war machine, 
that has brought about the change in this body, and if that was a major 
reason for what has happened here, I believe on the domestic front, 
Hurricane Katrina was just as important to the changes that we have 
seen in our Congress now. Therefore, our response must be as intense 
and as direct on what we do to adjust ourselves in that war as we do to 
come back here and take care of our people back home.

Madam Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak 
tonight. I look forward to our getting together to get this war behind 
us and bring our troops home. I applaud diplomacy in this area, and I 
look forward to getting our focus back on our people at home, 
particularly on our Hurricane Katrina survivors and evacuees.
