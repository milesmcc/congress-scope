Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator will just give me 
4 minutes. Vermont has lost per capita more men and women in Iraq and 
Afghanistan than any other State. One is being interred tomorrow. I 
wonder if I may have 4 minutes to speak about that person in morning 
business because the family will be here tomorrow for interment.
