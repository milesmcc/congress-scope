`Mr. BENNET â€” 3 December 2010`

Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today 
to honor the life and heroic service of SGT Jason T. Smith. Sergeant 
Smith, assigned to the 1st Explosive Ordnance Company, based in 
Iwakuni, Japan, died on November 19, 2010, from wounds he received 
while serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Helmand 
Province, Afghanistan. He was 28 years old.

A native of Colorado Springs, CO, Sergeant Smith graduated from 
Doherty High School in 2000. Upon graduation, Sergeant Smith enlisted 
in the Marines and was quickly recognized as a skilled and composed 
soldier. He served three tours of duty: two in Iraq and one in 
Afghanistan all with decoration.

During his 10 years of service, Sergeant Smith distinguished himself 
through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to take on one 
of the most dangerous and skillful jobs in the Marines--defusing bombs. 
Fellow soldiers respected his intensity, and they relied heavily on his 
leadership. Sergeant Smith was also a gifted teacher, and Marines under 
his command cite his marksmanship instruction as a high-point in their 
career.

Sergeant Smith worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the 
most dangerous areas of Iraq and Afghanistan. He is remembered by those 
who knew him as a consummate professional with an unending commitment 
to excellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated son, brother, 
and as a loving husband to his wife. In his free time, Sergeant Smith 
enjoyed fishing and playing basketball.

Mark Twain once said, ''The fear of death follows from the fear of 
life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Sergeant 
Smith's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly 
putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a 
sense of the highest honorable purpose.

He braved the chaos of combat zones throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. 
And though his fate on the battlefield was uncertain, he pushed 
forward, protecting America's citizens, her safety, and the freedoms we 
hold dear. For his service and the lives he touched, Sergeant Smith 
will forever be remembered as one of our country's bravest.

To Sergeant Smith's entire family--I cannot imagine the sorrow you 
must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss will be 
eased by your pride in Jason's service and by your knowledge that his 
country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his 
sacrifice.
