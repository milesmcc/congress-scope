Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I commend my good friend and colleague, Armed 
Services Chairman Ike Skelton, for authoring H.R. 2956, the 
''Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act.'' the Democratic Congress has 
drawn a line in the sand with this bill. It requires accountability 
from the Administration that the American people demand and deserve: 
stop the open-ended commitment in Iraq; stop the surge; and, stop 
sending our brave men and women in uniform to fight a ''winnable'' war. 
We have given this Administration enough time, enough U.S. blood, and 
too much hard-earned American dollars.

Let's call this war what it is--a civil war.

The solution for Iraq is not military. The solution for Iraq is 
political and diplomatic. We must once again engage our allies and 
Iraq's neighbors to renew a quest for a peaceful solution in Iraq. I 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2956. Support our valiant troops by 
voting to bring them home. Now.
