`Mr. HAGEL â€” 8 December 2008`

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. Presdient, I wish to express my sympathy over the loss 
of U.S. Army captain Robert Yllescas. Captain Yllescas, a native 
Guatemalan and graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, died on 
December 1 from injuries he sustained from an improvised explosive 
device in the mountains of Afghanistan on October 28. He was 31 years 
old.

After spending the first 18 years of his life in Guatemala, Captain 
Yllescas moved to Nebraska, where he enrolled in the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln and joined the ROTC. He married his wife Dena in her 
hometown of Osceola, NE. A graduate of Army Ranger school, Captain 
Yllescas' service included two tours of duty in Iraq and one in 
Afghanistan, where he proved to be an exemplary leader. As the 
commander of B Troop, 6-4 Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry 
Division, he led 90 U.S. and 200 Afghan soldiers in Nuristan province. 
He was awarded the Purple Heart by President Bush on November 10.

All of Nebraska is proud of Captain Yllescas' service to our country, 
as well as the thousands of brave men and women serving in the U.S. 
Armed Forces.

Captain Yllescas is remembered as a devoted husband, father, and son. 
In addition to his wife Dena, he is survived by his daughters, Julia, 
7, and Eva, 10 months; and parents Otto and Barb.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring U.S. 
Army CPT Robert Yllescas.
