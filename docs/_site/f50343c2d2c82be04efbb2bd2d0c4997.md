`Mr. WOLF â€” 15 May 2008`

---


Mr. WOLF. I had wanted to offer two amendments, one that would have 
prohibited government officials from attending the genocide Olympics on 
taxpayer money, and also Members of Congress. And no Member of Congress 
who speaks out on human rights should go to that Olympics.

Secondly, I wanted to offer an amendment that would create a 
bipartisan commission, much like the Iraq Study Group, to look at 
everything, to put everything on the table, all of the spending and tax 
policies, to get control of our spending and where we are.

We have $54 trillion of unfunded liabilities in this Nation. We have 
$9 trillion of debt, $1 trillion that the Chinese hold, and the Saudis 
also hold a large portion, the Saudis who had 15 Wahabbies on those 
airplanes that went into our buildings.

Standard & Poor's says we will lose our AAA bond rating in 2012, and 
Moody's says we will lose it in 2018. The value of the dollar is 
falling like a rock. Gasoline is increasing. Mr. Speaker, what kind of 
country are we leaving to our children? Are we leaving a country 
whereby China and Saudi Arabia will be their bankers?

Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the Lutheran pastor who stood up to the Nazis, 
said, ''The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world it 
leaves to its children.''

This Congress, on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democratic 
side, is not leaving a very good situation to their children and their 
grandchildren. I would ask you as Members of this Congress, as parents 
and grandparents, what kind of country do you want to


leave? What are you going to tell your kids and your grandkids later on 
when you say, When I was there, there was $54 trillion of debt, and I 
did nothing. There was $1 trillion held by the Chinese, who are spying 
against us, and Mr. Murtha knows how they are spying against us, we did 
nothing.

We lost our AAA bond rating, Mom or Dad or Grandma or Grandpa while 
you were there, did you do anything? And the answer will be: We did 
nothing.

I rise in opposition to this legislation.

I have been a member of the Appropriations Committee since 1995, yet 
I cannot recall a time that the House has avoided the Appropriations 
Committee process with such a critical nationally and internationally 
important piece of legislation.

Members of the Committee--including the minority--are being shut out 
of the process.

I wanted to offer an amendment that would prohibit U.S. government 
employees from attending the Olympics on the taxpayer's dime.

When awarded the honor of hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics, China had 
the opportunity to show the world that it has changed. But the China of 
today is worse than the China of yesterday, or of last year, or of the 
last decade. China is not progressing. It is regressing. It is more 
violent, more repressive, and more resistant to democratic values than 
ever before.

China, which jails Catholic bishops, Protestant house church leaders, 
Tibetan Buddhists, Muslim Uyghurs and Falun Gong practitioners; which 
is spying against us and supplying weapons to regimes like Khartoum; 
which has an extensive system of slave labor camps, was awarded the 
honor of hosting the 2008 summer Olympic games.

We should not reward the Beijing regime with our taxpayer dollars. 
U.S. officials should not be permitted to use Federal funds to attend 
the 2008 Olympics. But I am being prevented from offering this 
amendment because the Democrat leadership has gone around the 
Appropriations Committee and brought this bill to the floor under a 
closed rule.

I also wanted to offer an amendment that would create a bipartisan 
commission--much like the Iraq Study Group--to look at everything--tax 
policy and entitlement spending--and recommend legislative action to 
rein in our Federal debt.

We have $53 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and over $9 trillion 
dollars in debt. Standard and Poor's Investment Service has indicated 
that we could lose our triple-A bonding rating as early as 2012. The 
value of the dollar is falling through the floor. China holds our debt. 
OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia hold our debt. Dietrich Bonhoeffer 
said, ''The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world it 
leaves to its children.''

Our grandchildren will bear the burden of out-of-control entitlement 
spending if we do not act. It's on our watch to fix, and the process 
being used today shuts out critical issues that we must face.

This House needs to come together and work in a bipartisan manner to 
address the critical issues facing our country. This legislation today 
is the product of the heavy hand of the Democrat leadership in 
foreclosing an open and fair process and I cannot support it.
