Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, a 
veteran of the Iraqi war, a new member of the fiscally conservative 
Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, for not only joining us for this Special 
Order this evening on demanding accountability of the American people's 
tax money and how it is being spent in Iraq, but also playing a very 
important role in helping draft, carefully craft and write this 
resolution that the Blue Dog Coalition has endorsed and will be filed 
as a House resolution on the floor of this House this week. I thank the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania again for his work on that and for his 
service to our country.

At this time I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Bean, 
another very active member of the Blue Dog Coalition, someone who comes 
to


this town and demands fiscal accountability and responsibility like we 
are doing here on the floor of the House this evening.
