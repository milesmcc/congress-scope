`Mr. UDALL of Colorado â€” 14 February 2008`

---


Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
one of my esteemed colleagues and former classmates, Sir Franklin 
Miller, for receiving honorary knighthood by the British Government. 
Queen Elizabeth II, during her fall 2007 visit to Washington, DC, 
awarded Mr. Miller with honorary knighthood--a Knight Commander of the 
Order of the British Empire--in gratitude for his work to strengthen 
U.S.-U.K. defense collaboration during his career with the Department 
of Defense and as Special Assistant to President George W. Bush. I am 
pleased to recognize his commitment to America's security.

 Frank and I were both members of the Williams College Class of 1972. 
After graduating, he served as Communications Officer and Anti-
Submarine Warfare Officer aboard the USS Joseph Hewes, a Knox-class 
frigate, with deployments in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian and Atlantic 
Oceans. In 1977, he returned to school and received his MPA from 
Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and 
International Affairs.

 His talents at defense studies brought him to the State Department's 
Bureau of Political- Military Affairs from 1977 to 1979. For 22 years, 
he served under seven Secretaries in a series of progressively senior 
positions. His final assignments were twice as Acting Assistant 
Secretary for International Security Policy and once as Principal 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategy and Threat Reduction.

 Frank Miller served as Special Assistant to President George W. Bush 
and as Senior Director for Defense Policy and Arms Control on the 
National Security Council staff between 2001 and 2005. This made him 
responsible for Presidential policy initiatives in the fields of 
nuclear deterrence policy, strategic arms reduction, national space 
policy, defense trade reform, land-mines, and transforming the American 
and NATO militaries.

 He heroically assumed responsibility for the operation and 
management of the White House Situation Room immediately following the 
attacks on the World Trade Center Towers on September 11, 2001. This 
led him to direct interagency support of both Operation Enduring 
Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

 For his distinguished service, he was honored five times with the 
Defense Department's highest civilian award, the Defense Distinguished 
Civilian Service Medal. In addition, he has been awarded the Norwegian 
Royal Order of Merit, Grand Officer, and the French Legion of Honor, 
Officer. Knighthood is another fitting tribute to Sir Miller's 
distinguished 31-year career.

 Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me to congratulate Sir 
Miller for his recent knighthood. We are grateful to Sir Miller for his 
outstanding commitment and service to improving the security of this 
country. I wish him


good health, happiness, and success in his future endeavors.
