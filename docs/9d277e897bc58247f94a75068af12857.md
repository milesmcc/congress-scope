Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this budget resolution conference report 
allows Congress to take action on many of America's priorities.

This conference report starts by providing for many priorities 
through the revenue side of the budget.

This agreement includes monies to pay for extending expired and 
expiring revenue provisions.

These provisions include the teacher expense deduction, which helps 
teachers who buy school supplies.

These provisions include school construction bonds, to help repair 
our country's deteriorating school infrastructure.

And these provisions include help to businesses to stay competitive. 
In particular, the budget assumes extending the research and 
development credit, which gives businesses an incentive to increase 
research. This will keep America as a top innovator in science and 
technology.

This conference agreement on the budget resolution also includes 
monies to provide for education tax reform. So far this year, the 
Finance Committee has held two tax reform hearings. One of the major 
themes of the testimony has been simplification.

Witnesses almost always cite education tax incentives as an example 
of needless complexity. This conference report would allow us to help 
make education more accessible and affordable by making the education 
incentives easier to use.

The agreement also includes my amendment that was successfully added 
to the budget resolution on the Senate floor.

My amendment took the surpluses in the budget resolution and gave 
them back to the hard-working American families who earned them.

My amendment provided for some important priorities so that the 
business of America's families can be taken care of.

First, my amendment provided for permanence of the 10-percent tax 
bracket. That is an across-the-board tax cut for every taxpayer.

Second, my amendment provided for making permanent the changes to the 
child tax credit. That is a $1,000 tax credit per child. This tax 
credit recognizes that a family's ability to pay taxes decreases as the 
family size increases. Unless we act, the child tax credit will fall to 
$500 per child in 2010.

Third, my amendment provided for making permanent marriage penalty 
relief. This relief makes sure that a married couple filing a joint 
return has the same deductions and tax brackets as they would if they 
filed separately as individuals.

Fourth, my amendment provided for making permanent the increased 
dependent care credit and changes to the adoption credit.

Fifth, my amendment provided for tax provisions to help military 
families. And I am pleased to say that these are very close to being 
adopted by the Congress. This shows that Congress values the sacrifices 
that our men and women in uniform make for us every day.

Nearly 1/1/2/ million American service men and women have served in 
Iraq, Afghanistan, or both. Nearly 30,000 troops have been wounded in 
action.

Congress is about to show our support for our service men and women 
by making the Tax Code a little more troop-friendly.

We will extend the special tax rules that make sense for our military 
that expire in 2007 and 2008.

We can eliminate roadblocks in the current tax laws that present 
difficulties to veterans and servicemembers.

One of these roadblocks is how the Tax Code treats survivors of our 
fallen heroes. The families of soldiers killed in the line of duty 
receive a death gratuity benefit of $100,000.

The Tax Code restricts the survivors from putting this benefit into a 
Roth IRA. We are about to make sure that the family members of fallen 
soldiers can take advantage of these tax-favored accounts.

Another roadblock in the tax laws impedes our disabled veterans. I am 
talking about the time limit for filing for a tax refund. Most VA 
disability claims filed by veterans are quickly resolved. But many 
disability awards are delayed due to lost paperwork or the appeals of 
rejected claims.

Once a disabled vet finally gets a favorable award, the good news is 
that the disability award is tax-free. The bad news is that many of 
these disabled veterans get ambushed by a statute that bars them from 
filing a tax refund claim. We are about to give disabled veterans an 
extra year to claim their tax refunds.

Most troops doing the heavy lifting in combat situations are the 
lower ranking, lower income soldiers. Their income needs to count 
towards computing the earned-income tax credit, or EITC. Under current 
law, however, income earned by a soldier in a combat zone is exempt 
from income tax. This actually hurts low-income military personnel 
under the EITC.

The EITC combat-pay exception allows combat zone pay to count as 
earned income for purposes of determining the credit. That way, more 
soldiers qualify for the EITC. But this EITC combat-pay exception 
expires at the end of 2007.

We are about to make this provision permanent.

The budget resolution conference report also provides for some 
certainty to American families on the estate tax.

Lowering the estate tax to 2009 levels is the least that we can do as 
estate tax reform.

I am pleased that the conference report recommends appropriations of 
$240 million more than the President requested for the administrative 
costs for the Social Security Administration for fiscal year 2009.

These funds are badly needed to reduce the enormous waiting times 
that many applicants for Social Security disability benefits must wait 
before their claims are finally approved. Funds are also badly needed 
to improve the low levels of service to the public in SSA's local field 
offices.

I am pleased to see that the resolution captures Democratic health 
care priorities and provides economic relief


for families. It provides funding for maternal and child health; 
nutrition assistance for women, infants, and children or WIC; and the 
Social Services block grant. And the resolution accommodates 
legislation to modernize the unemployment insurance program.

The resolution retains the reserve funds passed in the Senate to 
reauthorize CHIP and expand coverage to eligible but unenrolled kids. 
This is a personal priority for me.

The budget also works to protect seniors from unscrupulous marketing 
of Medicare drug plans, thereby laying the groundwork for a strong 
Medicare bill currently under negotiation.

The resolution also provides for important improvements to Medicare, 
such as promoting the use of Health IT.

And it would set up a ''comparative effectiveness'' reserve fund to 
help us learn what treatments work best and most efficiently to keep 
Americans healthy. I am working with Chairman Conrad to introduce 
legislation on this topic this year.

All of these investments take steps toward addressing the underlying 
growth in health care costs.

The resolution is also tough on government waste, fraud, and abuse 
and includes important program integrity initiatives to crack down on 
wasteful or fraudulent spending in the Social Security, Medicare, 
Medicaid, and Unemployment Insurance Programs.

This budget resolution also accounts for important international 
trade priorities under the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. The 
resolution establishes a reserve fund for trade adjustment assistance 
and a separate reserve fund for other trade initiatives. These reserve 
funds will allow the Finance Committee to realize legislation to 
reauthorize trade adjustment assistance, as well as pursue legislation 
to extend trade preferences, reauthorize customs functions, and 
implement bilateral trade agreements.

Mr. President, I am thus pleased that this budget resolution 
conference report allows Congress to take action on these important 
priorities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to implement 
the improvements contemplated in the resolution. And I urge my 
colleagues to support the conference report.
