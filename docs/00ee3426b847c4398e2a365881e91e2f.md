`Mr. MENENDEZ â€” 16 September 2010`

Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to recognize September 15 
through October 15 as Hispanic Heritage Month. America has always 
celebrated its diverse heritage with pride. It has always honored those 
who have contributed and made this Nation great.

Irish Americans, Italian Americans, African Americans, Asian 
Americans--all Americans--have come to this Nation and added to the 
rich and colorful patchwork quilt of American democracy.

This resolution recognizes Hispanic Americans for the contributions 
they have made to the rich fabric of America. It designates the next 30 
days as Hispanic Heritage Month and in so doing celebrates the long 
history of Latinos in the United States and the extraordinary 
contribution they have made to this Nation throughout our history. That 
history is clear--written boldly but sometimes little known. But this 
is our history in America, and it is America's history.

Latinos have proudly served this Nation, helped build it and defend 
it, and continue to serve today.

We have been contributing to and have been part of the American 
tapestry for hundreds of years. Hispanics fought for freedom alongside 
the patriots in the American Revolution.

Increasingly, we find references to those who came before us--
Bernardo de Galvez, a Spanish army officer--the Governor of Louisiana 
from 1775 to 1785--who played a role in blocking British advances 
against George Washington in the American Revolution. And Jorge 
Farragut, a Spanish ship captain who came to America and fought for the 
colonies against the British.

He was the father of the Civil War hero ADM David Farragut, known for 
his famous rallying cry, ''Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead.''

I would imagine that few who walk past Farragut Square in 
Washington--not far from this Chamber--realize that Admiral Farragut 
was of Hispanic origin.

Latinos fought and died on both sides of the Civil War and have 
participated in every war since. There were at least 10,000 Mexican 
Americans fighting for the Union during the Civil War and a number of 
others fighting for the Confederacy.

In one of the folkloric tales of the Civil War, there was the story 
of Loretta Velasquez who was born in Cuba and claimed that she 
disguised herself as a male lieutenant and fought against Union forces 
at several battles, including Bull Run, and later claimed to have 
worked as a spy for the Confederacy.



Even in the Spanish-American War, a dozen Latinos were among Teddy 
Roosevelt's Rough Riders.

In World War I, an Army pilot, David Cantu Barkley of Laredo, TX, of 
Mexican decent volunteered to penetrate German lines in France. With a 
comrade, he drew maps of German positions and supplies.

Barkley drowned on the return trip, but his partner survived and 
carried back the logistical information. Praised by General Pershing, 
Barkley won the Medal of Honor. Among the heroes of World War II was 
marine PFC Guy ''Gabby'' Gabaldon who won the Navy Cross for capturing 
more than a thousand enemy soldiers in the South Pacific during the 
summer of 1944.

The honor and patriotism of these brave soldiers cannot be 
overstated.

The story of Alejandro Ruiz, an Army private who fought in Okinawa, 
epitomizes their commitment to this Nation and the tragedy some of them 
endured.

Private Ruiz's Medal of Honor citation noted his ''conspicuous 
gallantry above and beyond the call of duty.

. . . When an enemy soldier charged him his rifle jammed. Undaunted 
Private Ruiz whirled on his opponent and clubbed him down . . .

. . . Leaping from one opening to another, he sent burst after burst 
into the pillbox, killing 12 of the enemy and completely destroying the 
position . . .

. . . Private Ruiz's heroic conduct in the face of overwhelming odds, 
saved the lives of many of his comrades and eliminated an obstacle that 
long would have checked his unit's advance.''

Private Ruiz wrote in a letter: ''I never questioned my duty because 
I believe that as Americans we have a responsibility to serve our 
country and preserve our way of life and freedoms. All I can say is I 
did what I had to do.''

Private Ruiz served this Nation with honor. Madam President, 14,000 
Hispanic soldiers served in Korea and more than 300 died; 80,000 
Hispanics served in the Vietnam war, representing 5.5 percent of those 
who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country in those years--even 
though, at the time, Latinos comprised only 4.5 percent of the 
population.

As we speak, 28,000 Latinos currently serve with distinction in 
Afghanistan and Iraq; 561 casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan have been 
Hispanic casualties.

In fact, there are almost 1.5 million Hispanic veterans of the Armed 
Forces in this country today who also served with honor.

And of the Hispanics who have served in uniform, 41 of them have been 
awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, including David Cantu Barkley 
and Private Ruiz.

This month we celebrate the contribution of all Latinos to the 
history of this Nation.

We celebrate the contribution of the many community leaders and local 
heroes in our neighborhoods, our cities, and towns, and in every State 
in America.

All across this Nation, the Latino population is growing. We are now 
the largest minority group in the country--contributing to the 
community, the economy, and the political debate.

Today, Hispanics hold 29 seats in the U.S. Congress, 2 in the 
Cabinet, and 1 on the Supreme Court.

We are no longer on the outside looking in. We are at the table on 
every major issue before Congress--every major issue before the courts.

I stand here, a United States Senator, a lawyer, a Hispanic American 
who took his seat on the floor of this Chamber not long ago and proudly 
cast my vote for Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Justice of 
the U.S. Supreme Court.

That was a historic moment for me, a historic moment for the Hispanic 
American community, one we will never forget, but I can say with some 
measure of confidence, I believe it is only the beginning.

This month let us celebrate not only Hispanic Heritage but let us 
proudly celebrate and proclaim the history of Hispanics in America 
going back to the Revolution, and then let us recognize the role a new 
generation of young Latinos will play in making this, the 21st century, 
another American century.

I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join with me in 
celebrating the heritage and culture of Latinos in the United States 
and their immense contributions to this Nation.
