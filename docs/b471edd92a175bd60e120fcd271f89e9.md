Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the economists Linda Bilmes and Joseph 
Stiglitz recently produced an illuminating analysis of the real costs 
of the war in Iraq, which was published last Sunday in The Washington 
Post.

As the war grinds on toward its fifth year, and as the war continues 
to warp our Nation's priorities at home and abroad, this is an analysis 
that every American deserves to see. I also commend it to the attention 
of the Members of the Senate.

I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.
