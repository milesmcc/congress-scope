`Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico â€” 25 February 2008`

Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. It was actually a situation like that 
which caused me to say enough is enough, we have to get this fixed. It 
was last May, and at the time we couldn't talk about it, but it's been 
talked about publicly since then.

We had soldiers who were kidnapped in Iraq. We had, we thought, a tip 
on who might have done it. And there was an army of lawyers here in 
Washington and over a 24-hour delay in listening to communications 
because they had to touch a wire in the United States. I mean, 
you think about it, it's your kid, it's your kid that's been kidnapped. 
All of us are familiar here in America with the AMBER alerts. Speed 
matters when someone's been kidnapped, and you want to get information 
out as quickly as possible to try to save somebody. If it was your kid 
who was in a combat zone who has been kidnapped by insurgents, and 
we've got a room full of lawyers in Washington trying to get a warrant 
to listen to the communications of the insurgents that took him? That's 
not good enough. It's not good enough. And we should expect more of our 
government than that. And the responsibility for fixing it rests right 
here in this body.


We've got this odd situation with soldiers overseas in Afghanistan 
and Iraq and the Philippines in dangerous situations where they've got 
the authority to shoot an insurgent, but they can't listen to him 
without a warrant. Where is the sense in that?
