`Mr. KAGEN â€” 8 July 2009`

Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sense of sadness that I 
express my sincere condolences to the family, friends, and community of 
Peshtigo, Wisconsin's native son Steven Drees, who was killed in action 
in Afghanistan on June 28 while serving his country in Operation 
Enduring Freedom.

Private First Class Drees' enlistment began on July 25, 2008. He was 
assigned to D Company, 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th 
Infantry Division out of Fort Carson, Colorado. Frequently decorated, 
he counted among his awards three Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart.

When any soldier falls, we mourn collectively and we pray as one 
people. And when we lose one of our very youngest soldiers so close to 
home, we are especially aggrieved.

Nothing can replace what Steve's family has lost, but if it's any 
consolation, let it be remembered that Private First Class Steven Drees 
remained dutiful and brave at all times and that he was a loyal United 
States soldier. That such a young man could serve so selflessly is a 
tribute to the nobility and fortitude of the people of Peshtigo, the 
people of Wisconsin, and the citizens of these United States.

Steven will never be forgotten.
