Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin with 
a quote from Coretta Scott King: ''Struggle is a never ending process. 
Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it every generation.''

I rise today to talk about one of America's priorities in the 
emergency supplemental appropriation bill, and that is to fulfill the 
promise to help rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi from Hurricane 
Katrina and Hurricane Rita.

In August of 2005, the American people saw something that was hard to 
believe. They saw a U.S. government that was incompetent, a government 
that was inept, and a government that did not care about its open 
people.

Unfortunately, 2 days ago, President Bush vetoed the emergency 
supplemental bill and showed the American people that things haven't 
changed. After the President vetoed the bill, he had the audacity to 
make the following statement: '' . . . the bill is loaded with billions 
of dollars in non-emergency spending that has nothing to do with 
fighting the war on terror. Congress should debate these spending 
measures on their own merits--and not as a part of an emergency funding 
bill for our troops.''

Only two other people in the country believe that we are winning the 
war in Iraq, by the way. That's President Bush and Vice President 
Cheney. The cheese stands alone. The $1.3 billion for east and west 
bank levee protection and coastal protection isn't pork. The $30 
million for K-12 education assistance has been debated and has been 
deemed essential.

The $25 billion for small business disaster loans will help rebuild; 
the $80 million for HUD rental assistance will bring people back home; 
the $4.3 billion for FEMA disaster recovery grants is an emergency for 
our fellow Americans in Louisiana and Mississippi who have been waiting 
18 months for you to keep your promise to rebuild Louisiana and 
Mississippi.

Mr. President, you were wrong to veto this bill. I have been to New 
Orleans seven times and going back in June. Sadly, every time I look 
there, it look looks like a war zone. It is unbelievable that 18 months 
have passed and the most basic human needs have not yet been met; 18 
months later, and residents are not able to move back. There is still 
debris everywhere, and people are without electricity 18 months later. 
The roads are not passable, no clean running water, not enough schools 
and teachers; 18 months later and no street signs, toxic fumes in the 
air and not enough police; 18 months later, this is unacceptable.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle made the statement over 
and over again about how we should pass a clean bill. Well, I have been 
elected 25 years, and I have never seen a clean bill yet. If the 
President or my Republican colleagues would have done their job 18 
months ago, we wouldn't need to have these extra funds in the 
supplemental bill. It is shameful that the very people who write the 
checks and pay the taxes in our cities are not given the money they 
deserve.

I remember the President's press conference in Jefferson Square in 
New Orleans and his promise to rebuild. His veto showed the American 
people once again that he has no intention of living up to his promise.

The Democratic majority has done their job. They passed this bill. 
Sadly, the residents of Louisiana and Mississippi will have to keep 
waiting on you to remember your promise. The good citizens of Louisiana 
and Mississippi demand good government. This is responding to the 
caring, and it is also an example of not just talking the talk, but 
walking the walk.
