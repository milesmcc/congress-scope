# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mr. HUNTER â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, to complete this triad of veterans' fathers, 
fathers of sons who have served in Iraq, is Joe Wilson, whose son Alan 
has received the Combat Action Badge for service in Iraq and the 
Palmetto Cross, which is a high award for the National Guard in South 
Carolina, and who has a son in the Signal Corps, Julian, a doctor in 
the Navy, and a son Hunter, a well-named son, Hunter, in the ROTC.

The reason I am going through these members of the Wilson clan, Mr. 
Speaker, is because inspired by his wife Roxanne, all these young men 
are serving in the military, and if the Wilson family does not re-up, 
we are in trouble.

I yield such time as he may consume to the great gentleman from South 
Carolina, Joe Wilson, to follow that wonderful presentation by Mr. 
Akin.
