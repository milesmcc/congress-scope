Mr. SAXTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I would just like to say to my friend from Cleveland, who speaks very 
articulately on this bill, as I am sure he did on the original bill, 
the gentleman made some points that he believes I am sure very much 
that there


are some things in the bill that he disagrees with, and the gentleman 
and 48 other people voted against the original bill, and I am sure for 
many of the same reasons.

In fact, it would be surprising if they weren't the same reasons, 
because the 1,513 pages that the gentleman has under his arm that he 
referred to are almost identical to the original bill which is here, 
which has been available since December 6 of last year. And the 1,513 
pages that my friend referred to had one single change from the copy 
that I have in my hand that has been available since December 6. And 
that change, both the ranking member and I took care to explain, I 
think we explained it well, had to do with terrorism, had to do with 
Iraq, had to do with not holding the current government in Iraq 
responsible for acts committed by the previous regime. And we also of 
course added the second provision that had to do with back pay.

So, this is a good bill that passed by 370-49 previously.
