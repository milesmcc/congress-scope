`Mr. BURTON of Indiana â€” 5 March 2008`

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I was looking at the picture of 
Mr. Kashkoush, and all I can say is he exemplifies the thousands of 
young men and women who have gone to serve their country in 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the world. And we just can't say 
enough about young people like that who go out there and risk their 
lives to protect our freedoms. I am very happy that my colleague from 
Ohio took the time to introduce this legislation, and I am very happy 
to support that.

I yield back the balance of my time.
