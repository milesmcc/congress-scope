Mr. COSTELLO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
569, the Water Quality Investment Act. This legislation is extremely 
important to our local communities to improve stormwater and sewer 
system infrastructure.

In my congressional district alone, I have numerous communities, 
including the city of Sparta, the village of Coulterville, New Baden, 
Nameoki, and Ewing Township, that all need storm water and sewer system 
infrastructure improvements. However, the local communities have no 
money to make those improvements. We must provide a better standard of 
environmental health to our communities so that public health and our 
natural resources are not compromised.

H.R. 569 seeks to help by providing $1.8 billion over a 5-year period 
for sewer overflow control grants provided by the EPA. These grants 
would be used by communities to plan, design and construct treatment 
works to address combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows.

Mr. Chairman, we must help our State and local governments meet 
Federal standards and provide them with much needed relief. If it is a 
priority to build sewer and wastewater infrastructure in Iraq, it 
should be a priority here at home.

Again I strongly support H.R. 569 and urge my colleagues to do the 
same.
