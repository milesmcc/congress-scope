`Mr. ROGERS of Alabama â€” 26 July 2007`

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, Private First Class James J. 
Harrelson, age 19, a native of Dadeville, Alabama, was killed on July 
17, 2007, in Baghdad. PFC Harrelson was assigned to B Company, 2nd 
Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division based in Fort 
Riley, Kansas.

PFC Harrelson was a graduate of Dadeville High School, where he was a 
member of the student council and a talented athlete. He had been 
serving in Iraq since May of this year.

Words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family, and 
for the gratitude our country feels for his service. Pvt. Harrelson, 
like other brave men and women who have served in uniform, died serving 
not just the United States, but the entire cause of liberty. Indeed, 
like those who have served before him, he was a true American.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve our nation. Thank you, for the House's remembrance 
at this mournful occasion.
