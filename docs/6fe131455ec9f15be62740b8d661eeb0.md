`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 6 February 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I 
will object, let me remind our colleagues that 4 years ago last month, 
we were at exactly the same situation. My party came back to the 
majority. The Democratic majority of the previous Congress had not 
passed 11 out of the 13 appropriations bills. And what did the new 
Republican majority do? We took up an omnibus collection of 
appropriations bills. We had over 100 amendments offered. We gave 
everybody in the Senate an opportunity to offer amendments, and we 
disposed of all of those appropriations bills over a couple-week 
period.

What my good friend, the majority leader, is suggesting is that we 
take up a continuing resolution of 11 appropriations bills, with no 
amendments whatsoever, and he offers as an enticement an extra week 
off. This is completely unacceptable to the minority. First, he is 
saying that we cannot get adequate consideration to our Iraq proposals. 
Second, he is saying we cannot have any amendments to an over $400 
billion continuing appropriation. Therefore, I object.
