`Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN â€” 19 June 2008`

Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, America expects that when the United 
States sends our brave men and women into combat, we provide them with 
the resources to protect themselves and to accomplish their mission.

Finally today--after much delay--this Congress appears to be on the 
verge of providing our troops the funds they need to continue their 
courageous efforts in the Iraq and Afghanistan--both humanitarian for 
the Iraqi and Afghan people and military against those who would 
promote terror and chaos.

There's no doubt that this proposal is a clear victory for our troops 
and their families.

Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Obey and Mr. Murtha, Mr. Lewis and Mr. 
Young, this package ensures that our young; warfighters--all volunteers 
(Active, Guard and Reserve)--have the resources they need to protect 
themselves and do the job they've been sent to do.

But the bill also supports the troops and their families by bringing 
the Montgomery GI


Bill into the 21st Century. The legislation updates the GI Bill of 
Rights to recognize today's higher costs of higher education. And it 
also recognizes the new role of the Reserves and the National Guard--
3,200 from New Jersey will deploy this summer to Iraq with our 50th 
Brigade Combat Team.

But Mr. Speaker, this measure also includes a new, permanent 
provision that allows current soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines to 
transfer their educational benefits to a spouse or a child.

Mr. Speaker, this is a huge improvement. Too often our personnel and 
forced to leave the military service they love in order to pay for 
their children's college education. This bill allows experienced 
Marines, soldiers, airmen and sailors to transfer their benefits to a 
dependant without separating from the service.

This reform is good for the servicemember, good for the families and 
good for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.

My colleagues, the supplemental we vote on today is far from perfect. 
However, it represents a clear victory for our troops and their 
families.
