Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, we can do both: fund the troops and change our mission 
in Iraq. That is what this supplemental does, and we urge you, Mr. 
President, to look into your heart, reconsider, and sign it.

The American people, bipartisan majorities in both Houses of 
Congress, military experts, and the Iraq Study Group all agree the only 
way to succeed is to change our mission. Only President Bush and his 
small band of advisers think we should stay the course.

What is more, the President wrongly thinks the only way to support 
our troops is for everyone to rubberstamp his policies. That is not 
what the American people want. The American people want a change in 
mission. They want a new direction, not more of the same failed 
policies.

I have talked to generals and to NCOs. They do not want us to 
rubberstamp the President's policies. They want a debate because 
everyone knows the present direction is failing. Everyone knows we need 
a change of mission--except the President and his small group of 
advisers who are clustered down there at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and 
refuse to listen--stubbornly refuse to listen--to the experts, to the 
American people, and to so many others.

First, let me tell you what this supplemental does. The first thing 
it does is fund our troops. It fully supports our troops. It allocates 
more dollars for them than the President has asked for.

Second, it provides reasonable and meaningful guidelines to protect 
our troops by ensuring that all units that are sent overseas to fight 
are ready, trained, and equipped to fight. It will require the 
Department of Defense to adhere to its own guidelines to ensure that 
every unit that is deployed is ''fully mission capable.''

Why would President Bush want to send our troops to Afghanistan and 
Iraq, into fierce battles, without the training and equipment needed to 
get the job done and come home safely? But when he says he will veto 
this bill, he will veto that provision.

Third, this legislation shows both the United States and Iraq how to 
change the failing strategy.

What has happened is simple. Our mission in Iraq has devolved so that 
most of what we do is patrol, police, and stand in the middle of a 
civil war. The Sunnis and the Shiites have hated each other for 
centuries. Their enmity goes way back. They will continue to not like 
each other, not work with each other, fight with each other long after 
we are gone--whether it is 3 months or 3 years. Yet most of the time 
our troops--our brave men and women--are simply caught in the middle of 
a civil war. We have not chosen a side; we are just in the middle.

The original purpose in Iraq was to fight terrorism. Our supplemental 
says, let's go back to that original purpose: counterterrorism, as well 
as force protection, and training the Iraqis. But to continue to spend 
most of our time, effort, and lives--lives--patrolling a civil war 
makes no sense.
