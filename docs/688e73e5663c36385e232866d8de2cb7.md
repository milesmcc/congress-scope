# RESOLUTIONS OF DISAPPROVAL
## `688e73e5663c36385e232866d8de2cb7`
`Mr. LOTT â€” 5 February 2007`

---


Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me get right to the point. This is all 
show and tell. We know the Senate is ready to have a full debate on the 
question of how we proceed in Iraq. There are a number of resolutions 
that have been suggested that are pending. We know our leaders are 
going to find a way to work this out. So why are we here taking all 
this time to accuse each other of unfairness and trying to block and 
delay? We don't want to do that. There is a way we can work this out 
where resolutions of different points of view can be offered. I don't 
know what the magic number is. The leaders are going to work that out. 
But to come to the floor and suggest that we don't want a full debate--
this is the Senate. We are going to have a full debate on this approach 
and a lot of others as we go forward----
