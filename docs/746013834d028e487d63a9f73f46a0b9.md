`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 26 March 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to thank our leader for his 
comments about the progress that has been made in the Senate on issues 
that affect the working middle-class families of this country and also 
for his responses on the issue of the war in Iraq, where there should 
be an opportunity, as we focus on the particular amendment, to get into 
that in greater detail. But I thank him for his very worthwhile 
comments this afternoon.
