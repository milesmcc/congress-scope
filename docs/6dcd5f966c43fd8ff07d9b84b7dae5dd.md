Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Gregg for his opening 
statement. I associate myself especially with his comments and concern 
related to corruption at the World Bank and the U.N. and in our 
assistance programs in Iraq. We have serious and nonpartisan concerns. 
These go across the spectrum in this body. We intend to address them. I 
commend the Senator from New Hampshire for raising them in his 
statement.

We are trying very much to work out amendments. I hope we can go to 
third reading.
