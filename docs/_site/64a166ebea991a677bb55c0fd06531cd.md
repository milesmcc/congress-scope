Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the motion to instruct 
conferees providing for supplemental appropriations for ongoing 
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

I support the portion of these instructions that would require the 
Secretary of Defense to certify if the release of photographs of 
detainees would endanger citizens of the U.S. or members of the armed 
services. We send our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen abroad to 
protect our security. We owe it to them to make sure that we do not do 
anything that puts them in needless jeopardy.

And I also strongly support the notion that we need to endorse the 
higher House funding levels for defense and military construction. 
Absolutely needed. If we are going to believe the administration and 
congressional leadership, this will be the last supplemental bill to 
fund the needs of our soldiers in Iraq and, may I add, their mission, 
those soldiers' mission, expanded mission, in Afghanistan. Personally, 
I find that hard to believe.

This supplemental should not be considered in a vacuum. What should 
not be lost in all of this is that our President is proposing a defense 
budget that barely keeps up with inflation and specifically contains a 
significant cut in our ballistic missile program, at a time when North 
Korea and Iran are testing their capabilities and, quite honestly, 
testing our resolve.

And, lastly, Madam Speaker, I have concerns about the expanded 
spending authority of the International Monetary Fund, who would be 
eligible to tap that fund in terms of drawing rights. And what's more 
bizarre is that under the recent agreements that we've been reading 
about, the United States of America now is eligible, shall we say, like 
other Third World countries, to have its own drawing rights, which is 
totally bizarre and inappropriate.

Madam Speaker, our first responsibility as Members is to protect our 
constituents, including those in the military. This motion to instruct 
helps achieve that mission and other important missions.
