Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I thank the chairman very much for 
presiding over this very important legislation. As I have noted, any 
number of bills from the Energy and Commerce committee have been very 
constructive.

I thank the manager from our friends on the other side of the aisle, 
and I thank in particular Representative Harman and the collaborative 
effort between Energy and Commerce and, as well, Veterans' Affairs.

This bill, modest in funding--and I would like to emphasize that 
before I even speak about its importance--modest in funding, $5 million 
per year between 2011, I believe, and 2015, takes an important step 
toward the value that we place on our service men and women. One, we 
thank them while they are serving, and we have made a commitment to 
thank them when their service is finished.

My State happens to be unique in having the highest percentage of 
returning soldiers, in particular from Iraq and Afghanistan, in the 
State of Texas. In addition, many of you are aware of many of the bases 
in our State, but, as well, you are aware of the horrific tragedy that 
occurred at Fort Hood just a few months ago and, of course, coming up 
on its first-year recognition.

In that instance, many were lost, but some were injured; and the idea 
of using soldiers who have been trained by the military to return home 
for first responder utilization is a brilliant idea and one that is 
long in coming. It is well known that veterans do have a higher 
unemployment in the general population in many instances.

But also, Mr. Speaker, we know that many of our veterans, because of 
a number of serious issues, find themselves homeless. Where is our 
continued promise about treating them with the same respect and dignity 
that we have done so while they were in the service and then when they 
are out?

So this particular legislation, H.R. 3199, does two things that I 
think are enormously important, takes advantage of the important talent 
that is coming home, that wonderful training that saves lives on the 
battlefield to use in America's emergency rooms.

Then I was so delighted to be able to hear that as we move to have 
this massive and important change in medical reform, health care reform 
that is going to save lives--particularly, I think, tomorrow will be a 
number of new provisions coming out in the health care bill--now we 
have the ability to assess the training of these very fine men and 
women to serve in America's medical professions. This is key. It's a 
great partnership.

I thank the author of the bill. I rise to support it. I am loudly 
saying to those who are returning home to Texas and other States around 
the Nation that we now have an opportunity to use your great talents to 
save lives, to be in America's hospitals, to be in fire stations, to 
assist police officers and to be there when danger and disaster comes 
to face Americans on the home soil.

What better way of using the great talent that we have. The men and 
women who were willing to offer their lives on the battlefield now can 
come home and serve their fellow Americans in one of the highest 
professions we have and that is the health care profession, where you 
can say that no matter where you are, you have the ability to save 
lives.

I ask my colleagues to support enthusiastically H.R. 3199.
