# TIME TO LEAVE IRAQ
## `b3eff7d5fbe3c71cdd9fddb9f1cf356a`
`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 10 July 2007`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the time has come for us to leave Iraq. 
The President intends to continue his war until he leaves office and 
let the next President clean up his mess. White House advisers debate 
how to buy more time.

Over 3,600 U.S. troops have been killed. Hundreds, perhaps thousands 
more, will be killed while we wait for this President to end this war. 
Thirty thousand U.S. troops wounded. Will that number double while we 
wait for this President to end his war? Thousands of Iraqi men, women, 
and children dead, $10 billion each month squandered. Are we ready to 
spend $200 billion more?

On Sunday, the New York Times laid out why, how, and when the U.S. 
should end this war. It pulled no punches about how ugly the aftermath 
might be. It was a hard and honest statement of where we stand right 
now and where we need to go.

Mr. Speaker, Congress must act. It is time to end this war.









[From the New York Times, July 8, 2007]















 The Road Home




 It is time for the United States to leave Iraq, without any 


 more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly 


 exit.



 Like many Americans, we have put off that conclusion, 


 waiting for a sign that President Bush was seriously trying 


 to dig the United States out of the disaster he created by 


 invading Iraq without sufficient cause, in the face of global 


 opposition, and without a plan to stabilize the country 


 afterward.



 At first, we believed that after destroying Iraq's 


 government, army, police and economic structures, the United 


 States was obliged to try to accomplish some of the goals Mr. 


 Bush claimed to be pursuing, chiefly building a stable, 


 unified Iraq. When it became clear that the president had 


 neither the vision nor the means to do that, we argued 


 against setting a withdrawal date while there was still some 


 chance to mitigate the chaos that would most likely follow.



 While Mr. Bush scorns deadlines, he kept promising 


 breakthroughs--after elections, after a constitution, after 


 sending in thousands more troops. But those milestones came 


 and went without any progress toward a stable, democratic 


 Iraq or a path for withdrawal. It is frighteningly clear that 


 Mr. Bush's plan is to stay the course as long as he is 


 president and dump the mess on his successor. Whatever his 


 cause was, it is lost.



 The political leaders Washington has backed are incapable 


 of putting national interests ahead of sectarian score 


 settling. The security forces Washington has trained behave 


 more like partisan militias. Additional military forces 


 poured into the Baghdad region have failed to change 


 anything.



 Continuing to sacrifice the lives and limbs of American 


 soldiers is wrong. The war is sapping the strength of the 


 nation's alliances and its military forces. It is a dangerous 


 diversion from the life-and-death struggle against 


 terrorists. It is an increasing burden on American taxpayers, 


 and it is a betrayal of a world that needs the wise 


 application of American power and principles.



 A majority of Americans reached these conclusions months 


 ago. Even in politically polarized Washington, positions on 


 the war no longer divide entirely on party lines. When 


 Congress returns this week, extricating American troops from 


 the war should be at the top of its agenda.



 That conversation must be candid and focused. Americans 


 must be clear that Iraq, and the region around it, could be 


 even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans leave. There 


 could be reprisals against those who worked with American 


 forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. Potentially 


 destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and Syria. Iran 


 and Turkey could be tempted to make power grabs. Perhaps most 


 important, the invasion has created a new stronghold from 


 which terrorist activity could proliferate.



 The administration, the Democratic-controlled Congress, the 


 United Nations and America's allies must try to mitigate 


 those outcomes--and they may fail. But Americans must be 


 equally honest about the fact that keeping troops in Iraq 


 will only make things worse. The nation needs a serious 


 discussion, now, about how to accomplish a withdrawal and 


 meet some of the big challenges that will arise.













the mechanics of withdrawal




 The United States has about 160,000 troops and millions of 


 tons of military gear inside Iraq. Getting that force out 


 safely will be a formidable challenge. The main road south to 


 Kuwait is notoriously vulnerable to roadside bomb attacks. 


 Soldiers, weapons and vehicles will need to be deployed to 


 secure bases while airlift and sealift operations are 


 organized. Withdrawal routes will have to be guarded. The 


 exit must be everything the invasion was not: based on 


 reality and backed by adequate resources.



 The United States should explore using Kurdish territory in 


 the north of Iraq as a secure staging area. Being able to use 


 bases and ports in Turkey would also make withdrawal faster 


 and safer. Turkey has been an inconsistent ally in this war, 


 but like other nations, it should realize that shouldering




 part of the burden of the aftermath is in its own interest.



 Accomplishing all of this in less than six months is 


 probably unrealistic. The political decision should be made, 


 and the target date set, now.













the fight against terrorists




 Despite President Bush's repeated claims, Al Qaeda had no 


 significant foothold in Iraq before the invasion, which gave 


 it new base camps, new recruits and new prestige.



 This war diverted Pentagon resources from Afghanistan, 


 where the military had a real chance to hunt down Al Qaeda's 


 leaders. It alienated essential allies in the war against 


 terrorism. It drained the strength and readiness of American 


 troops.



 And it created a new front where the United States will 


 have to continue to battle terrorist forces and enlist local 


 allies who reject the idea of an Iraq hijacked by 


 international terrorists. The military will need resources 


 and bases to stanch this self-inflicted wound for the 


 foreseeable future.














 the question of bases




 The United States could strike an agreement with the Kurds 


 to create those bases in northeastern Iraq. Or, the Pentagon 


 could use its bases in countries like Kuwait and Qatar, and 


 its large naval presence in the Persian Gulf, as staging 


 points.



 There are arguments for, and against, both options. Leaving 


 troops in Iraq might make it too easy--and too tempting--to 


 get drawn back into the civil war and confirm suspicions that 


 Washington's real goal was to secure permanent bases in Iraq. 


 Mounting attacks from other countries could endanger those 


 nations' governments.



 The White House should make this choice after consultation 


 with Congress and the other countries in the region, whose 


 opinions the Bush administration has essentially ignored. The 


 bottom line: the Pentagon needs enough force to stage 


 effective raids and airstrikes against terrorist forces in 


 Iraq, but not enough to resume large-scale combat.
















 the civil war




 One of Mr. Bush's arguments against withdrawal is that it 


 would lead to civil war. That war is raging, right now, and 


 it may take years to burn out. Iraq may fragment into 


 separate Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite republics, and American 


 troops are not going to stop that from happening.



 It is possible, we suppose, that announcing a firm 


 withdrawal date might finally focus Iraq's political leaders 


 and neighboring governments on reality. Ideally, it could 


 spur Iraqi politicians to take the steps toward national 


 reconciliation that they have endlessly discussed but refused 


 to act on.



 But it is foolish to count on that, as some Democratic 


 proponents of withdrawal have done. The administration should 


 use whatever leverage it gains from withdrawing to press its 


 allies and Iraq's neighbors to help achieve a negotiated 


 solution.



 Iraq's leaders--knowing that they can no longer rely on the 


 Americans to guarantee their survival--might be more open to 


 compromise, perhaps to a Bosnian-style partition, with 


 economic resources fairly shared but with millions of Iraqis 


 forced to relocate. That would be better than the slow-motion 


 ethnic and religious cleansing that has contributed to 


 driving one in seven Iraqis from their homes.



 The United States military cannot solve the problem. 


 Congress and the White House must lead an international 


 attempt at a negotiated outcome. To start, Washington must 


 turn to the United Nations, which Mr. Bush spurned and 


 ridiculed as a preface to war.
















the human crisis




 There are already nearly two million Iraqi refugees, mostly 


 in Syria and Jordan, and nearly two million more Iraqis who 


 have been displaced within their country. Without the active 


 cooperation of all six countries bordering Iraq--Turkey, 


 Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria--and the help of 


 other nations, this disaster could get worse. Beyond the 


 suffering, massive flows of refugees--some with ethnic and 


 political resentments--could spread Iraq's conflict far 


 beyond Iraq's borders.



 Kuwait and Saudi Arabia must share the burden of hosting 


 refugees. Jordan and Syria, now nearly overwhelmed with 


 refugees, need more international help. That, of course, 


 means money. The nations of Europe and Asia have a stake and 


 should contribute. The United States will have to pay a large 


 share of the costs, but should also lead international 


 efforts, perhaps a donors' conference, to raise money for the 


 refugee crisis.



 Washington also has to mend fences with allies. There are 


 new governments in Britain, France and Germany that did not 


 participate in the fight over starting this war and are eager 


 to get beyond it. But that will still require a measure of 


 humility and a commitment to multilateral action that this 


 administration has never shown. And, however angry they were 


 with President Bush for creating this mess, those nations 


 should see that they cannot walk away from the consequences. 


 To put it baldly, terrorism and oil make it impossible to 


 ignore.



 The United States has the greatest responsibilities, 


 including the admission of many more refugees for permanent 


 resettlement. The most compelling obligation is to the tens 


 of thousands of Iraqis of courage and good will--translators, 


 embassy employees, reconstruction workers--whose lives will 


 be in danger because they believed the promises and 


 cooperated with the Americans.
















 the neighbors




 One of the trickiest tasks will be avoiding excessive 


 meddling in Iraq by its neighbors--America's friends as well 


 as its adversaries.



 Just as Iran should come under international pressure to 


 allow Shiites in southern Iraq to develop their own 


 independent future, Washington must help persuade Sunni 


 powers like Syria not to intervene on behalf of Sunni Iraqis. 


 Turkey must be kept from sending troops into Kurdish 


 territories.



 For this effort to have any remote chance, Mr. Bush must 


 drop his resistance to talking with both Iran and Syria. 


 Britain, France, Russia, China and other nations with 


 influence have a responsibility to help. Civil war in Iraq is 


 a threat to everyone, especially if it spills across Iraq's 


 borders.



 President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have used 


 demagoguery and fear to quell Americans' demands for an end 


 to this war. They say withdrawing will create bloodshed and 


 chaos and encourage terrorists. Actually, all of that has 


 already happened--the result of this unnecessary invasion and 


 the incompetent management of this war.



 This country faces a choice. We can go on allowing Mr. Bush 


 to drag out this war without end or purpose. Or we can insist 


 that American troops are withdrawn as quickly and safely as 


 we can manage--with as much effort as possible to stop the 


 chaos from spreading.
