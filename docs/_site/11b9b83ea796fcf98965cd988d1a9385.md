Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The point I want to add to what you're talking 
about is, what if this would have happened?

It seems like we always have people in Washington, if something major 
happens, like a major insurance company or a major investment company 
or a major bank, it's like Washington, D.C. will step all over each 
other as to who's going to help them first, who's going to bail them 
out, who's going to give them something to make everything all right. 
And I don't want this to sound like we don't understand the ripple 
effect of what could happen if some of these entities aren't helped. We 
understand that.

But when it was the average person who made a mistake with their 
housing loan, hey, you're on your own. Pull yourself up by your 
bootstraps.

Well, Lehman Brothers, you pull yourself up by your bootstraps. 
Merrill Lynch, you pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

I'm not saying you don't need to take responsibility for your actions 
because you certainly do. But when we needed to help 10 million kids 
get health care through the State Children's Health Insurance Program, 
President Bush says we don't have the money. $35 billion over 5 years. 
We spend $10 billion a month in Iraq, but the President and a small 
group of radical Republicans in the House said we don't have the money 
for this. It's too much. It would be 3/1/2/ months in Iraq.

But if something like this happens where we have all this, a big 
major financial company, something happens, well, here we are, all of a 
sudden we've got more money.

Think about what the Republican Congress and Republican President did 
to our financial situation, not just how they destabilized the markets. 
I don't know if you got into this, Mr. Altmire, before I got here or 
not. But think about what they did. They raised the debt limit five 
times. Maybe six. I may be missing one. Five times. They borrowed $3 
trillion from China, Japan and OPEC countries.

Now you want to talk about putting the next generation behind the 
eight-ball, go borrow $3 trillion from our biggest competitor in China 
and watch them wipe out manufacturing in Pennsylvania, in Ohio and all 
over the industrial Midwest.

Don't regulate the markets. Don't invest in education. Make tuition 
costs go up 8, 9, 10 percent a year all over the country. The Pell 
Grant was almost meaningless. Student loans were 6.8 percent last year.

All of these issues add up to saying they weren't paying attention. 
Their philosophy of government just doesn't work. That's what this 
whole thing says.

We're joined by the gentleman from Colorado, the host of the 
Democratic National Convention. I yield to Mr. Perlmutter.
