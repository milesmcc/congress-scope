Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, today, we commemorate the sixth anniversary 
of the terrible terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. We remember 
the men, women and children who lost their lives that day and we honor 
the courage and the heroism of our first responders and those who put 
themselves in harm's way to help others.

This anniversary is also a time to reflect on the values that define 
us and separate us from terrorists, values like liberty, democracy, 
tolerance, freedom of expression and respect for the rule of law.

It is also appropriate to recognize just how misguided the Bush 
administration's response to those attacks has been. Six years later, 
Osama bin Laden is still at large while our military is pinned down in 
a civil war in a country that had nothing to do with the attacks in an 
occupation that serves as a rallying point for terrorist recruitment 
and fundraising. It is clear that this is a policy that is making our 
nation less safe, not more safe, and the first step towards a policy 
that effectively combats global terrorism is to end the occupation of 
Iraq.
