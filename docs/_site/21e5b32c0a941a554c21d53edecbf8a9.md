Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland. Madam Speaker, I submit the following for 
the Record:

Requesting Member: Congressman Roscoe G. Bartlett.

Bill Number: H.R. 5658.

Account: RTD&E, Army, Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced 
Technology.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: Mack Trucks, Inc., Volvo 
Powertrain North America.

Address of Requesting Facility: 13302 Pennsylvania Avenue, 
Hagerstown, MD 21742.

Description of Request: The requested fund will be used to build, 
test, and evaluate up to five heavy tactical trucks with hybrid 
electric power trains. The program's goal is to provide the military 
with a more fuel efficient, cleaner, and easily maintained heavy truck 
power train. A secondary goal is to provide a truck engine that can 
provide the same electricity source as a traditional diesel generator.

Requesting Member: Congressman Roscoe G. Bartlett.

Bill Number: H.R. 5658.

Account: RTD&E, Air Force, Multiple UAS cooperative concentrated 
observation and engagement systems against a common ground objective.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: Proxy Aviation Systems.

Address of Requesting Facility: 12850 Middlebrook Road, Germantown, 
MD 20874.

Description of Request: The proposed program will provide the U.S. 
military with an advanced ISR capability to find and identify terrorist 
activity more rapidly and with a greater level of accuracy. The system 
will result in a lower cost of procurement and life cycle cost due to 
reduced manpower.

Requesting Member: Congressman Roscoe G. Bartlett.

Bill Number: H.R. 5658.

Maintenance.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: Otomelara North America, Inc.

Address of Requesting Facility: 1625 I Street North West, Washington, 
DC 20006.

Description of Request: Increasing O&M funding for the Mk75 weapon 
will boost performance of the post-groomed guns, reducing out-of-
service down time, and raising overall reliability for the Navy. The 
FFG-7's Mk75 76mm gun possesses adequate range for effective 
engagement, but critical funding shortfalls in maintenance assessment/
grooming and parts support have kept the guns from operating with the 
requisite readiness to be as effective as possible against the surface.

Requesting Member: Congressman Roscoe G. Bartlett.

Bill Number: H.R. 5658.

Account: RDT&E, Army, Warfighter Technology.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: Engineering Systems Solutions.

Address of Requesting Facility: 5726 Industry Lane, Frederick, MD 
21704.

Description of Request: This project expedites the repair of urgently 
needed battlefield equipment, thereby increasing the mission capable 
level of aircraft and vehicle units. This


leads to improved warfighter readiness and safety. Repair of battle 
damaged aircraft skin responds to the vulnerability reduction request 
for new technologies that improves affordability and increases 
capabilities. This technology will be commercialized to reduce the 
repair cost and duration of certain currently deployed aircraft and 
vehicles.

Requesting Member: Congressman Roscoe G. Bartlett.

Bill Number: H.R. 5658.

Account: RTD&E, Army, Environmental Quality Technology.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: Fairchild Controls Corporation.

Address of Requesting Facility: 540 Highland Street, Frederick, MD 
21701.

Description of Request: This program will provide increased 
protection to troops through filtration of toxic industrial chemicals. 
It will also provide reduced operation and support cost over 
traditional filtration systems. This program will provide reduced 
logistical burden associated with replacement of filters, and reduced 
dependence on global warming refrigerants.

Requesting Member: Congressman Roscoe G. Bartlett.

Bill Number: H.R. 5658.

Account: RTD&E, Army, Nuclear and Conventional Physical Security 
Equipment.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: General Dynamics Robotic Systems.

Address of Requesting Facility: 1234 Tech Court, Westminster, MD 
21157.

Description of Request: The MDARS robot autonomously performs random 
patrols, detects intruders, and determines the status of inventory, 
barriers, gates, and locks using Radio Frequency Identification, RFID, 
technology. The requested funds would develop additional capabilities 
and procure four vehicles for force protection demonstrations. The 
enhanced MDARS could be used for high-risk patrol operations in Iraq 
and Afghanistan or forward operating bases, airfields, ports, and high 
value supply depots, improving force protection by limiting military 
personnel from high risk mission exposure.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: CherryRoad GT, Inc.

Address of Requesting Facility: 8150 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, VA 22182.

Description of Request: Army Knowledge Online must expand help desk 
capacity to meet increased call volume currently limited by lack of 
space at the primary site. Establishing a secondary site provides all 
critical expansion capability and functions as a backup site in case of 
attack or natural disaster. This expansion will benefit all DOD 
entities, service members, their families, DOD civilian employees, and 
select contractors who use the portal. Additionally, the portal allows 
the 52 state Adjutants General to coordinate with the Guard and Army 
Reserve to react to natural disaster or to counterterrorist threats and 
enhance force protection.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: ACAGI, Inc.

Address of Requesting Facility: 4539 Metropolitan Court, Suite 202, 
Frederick, MD 21704.

Description of Request: The purpose of this project is to develop a 
weapon integrated, fire control system that includes real time Tagging 
and Marking, immediately and inconspicuously recognizing friend from 
foe, especially with noncooperative targets at ranges where physical 
contact is not possible, other than line of sight. This capability 
greatly enhances the warfighter's real time cognition and decision-
making ability, especially in urban, counter-insurgent, complex, no 
frontlines situations, with the blending and rapidly changing 
definition of friend or foe, improving the warfighter's lethality and 
survivability.

casualty and pick-up zone. The recommended basis of issue for the 
CASEVAC conversional kit is two per cargo helicopter and one per 
utility helicopter.

contamination properties such as particulate, moisture, density, total 
oxygen content, benzene, olefins, aromatics, octane, and cetane index 
to identify the class of fuel.

Legal Name of Requesting Facility: DRS Power Technology Inc.

Address of Requesting Facility: 166 Boulder Drive, Suite 201E, 
Fitchburg, MA 01420.

Description of Request: The requested funding will design and build a 
hybrid electric drive prototype system for insertion and testing at the 
Navy Land Bases Test Site. Development and demonstration of a prototype 
DDG51 hybrid electric drive system will enable the fuel savings 
estimated at 13,000 barrels of fuel operation per year, per ship. The 
return on investment, installation and nonrecurring cost to payback in 
3 to 5 years with a projected savings of between $2M and $4M per ship, 
per year. Total opportunity of up to $5B in savings if all 62 ships in 
the class are converted. The warfighting advantages are that longer on-
station time for the same fuel load, reduced gas turbine engine 
operating hours and maintenance, reduce logistics tail, added generator 
redundancy and potential for increased total ship service power.
