Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this resolution. Let me just speak to 
the point that is made by the resolution that talks about the need to 
disclose in open session facts which would deal with corruption, and I 
am quoting, ''including allegations that investigations were thwarted, 
stifled for political reasons, and that that classification should be 
rescinded.''

I have looked at Mr. Butler's testimony to the committee. I have read 
it. I have got it in front of me. He talks a great deal, acknowledging 
that there is corruption in the Iraqi Government, as there is in 
practically every government in the Middle East, to some degree. He 
talks about that.

Mr. Speaker, he also said that he would be happy to talk about 
details concerning any political moves to avert investigations into 
corruption. He would be happy to talk about those details in a 
classified session. So he gave that opportunity, as I understand it, to 
the committee, and the committee didn't take him up on it.

I would just say, Mr. Speaker, that sources and methods are 
important. If there was a secret conversation that went on in the Iraqi 
Government and that secret conversation was listened to by somebody who 
then relayed that to the U.S. Government, or U.S. officials, laying 
that out for the public without going into classified session would not 
be good for American intelligence operations. This committee could have 
gone into classified session and had all the details that they needed.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this particular resolution.
