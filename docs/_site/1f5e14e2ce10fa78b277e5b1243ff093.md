Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, one month ago when we were trying to add 
funding to provide the largest expansion of the GI bill in the history 
of the bill


since it was first approved in 1945, the House Minority Leader issued 
the following statement. He said, ''House Republicans believe that 
loading up the troop funding bill with billions upon billions of 
unrelated Washington spending is reckless and dangerous.''

Now, it was difficult for me at the time to understand how adding 
education benefits for our troops was unrelated to funding the troops, 
but today we are now being asked to consider a nongermane amendment 
which would bring a divisive energy debate into legislation which is 
trying to provide for the needs of our military families around the 
country and which is trying to provide the needs in the health care 
area for our veterans.

If I were to debate energy in the middle of this bill, I would point 
out that one of the reasons that we have $4 gas today is that we have 
an administration which has pursued fiscal policies that have borrowed 
almost $2 trillion to finance tax cuts and to finance the war in Iraq, 
and that has contributed to driving down the value of the dollar, which 
has in turn raised the cost of purchasing a gallon of gasoline by 30 
percent.

If I were to debate energy on this bill, I would point out that, 
since Jimmy Carter left office, we have had a succession of 
administrations running from Reagan to Bush that systemically presided 
over the gutting of energy research done by the government on 
alternative energy sources.

I would also point out that over the last 8 years we have had an 
energy policy run by an administration dominated by two oil men in the 
President and the Vice President.

I would point out that their national security advisor, Secretary 
Rice, served on Chevron's board of directors for 10 years and even had 
an oil tanker named after her; that Interior Secretary Gale Norton 
started her career at a think tank funded by energy companies; commerce 
Secretary Don Evans was former president and CEO of a Texas oil 
company; Deputy Interior Secretary Griles was a former lobbyist for the 
oil, chemical, and mining industry, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

I would also point out that we on this side of the aisle have worked 
to pass increased fuel economy standards for automobiles; we have voted 
to eliminate $14 billion in special tax breaks for oil and gas 
companies; we voted to crack down on speculation which has driven up 
the cost of oil and gas at the expense of the American people. I would 
have pointed out that we have voted to get more oil from the National 
Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. And, I would be pointing out that we have 
also asked the President to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve.



I would also point out that we support drilling on the 68 million 
acres of public lands that are already leased and not being developed. 
That is what I would point out if I were in a debate on energy. But, in 
fact, this is supposed to be a discussion about the needs of our 
military families for housing, for education, and the needs of our 
veterans for health care. And I think we would best serve the country 
in this Chamber tonight if we would focus our remarks on that issue. 
And that is what I will continue to do.
