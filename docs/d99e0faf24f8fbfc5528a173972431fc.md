`Mr. BLUNT â€” 4 October 2007`

Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate the sentiment. If I am not in error, I hope 
we don't just waste the 2 weeks, and instead begin the discussions that 
we need to get to a bill that puts the health care of kids who don't 
have access to insurance first.

On one more appropriations topic, two comments made this week by 
Chairman Obey, and I was interested in more information from the 
gentleman. One was that we won't do any supplemental funding for our 
troops in Afghanistan and Iraq this year, and I believe he may have 
said ''and potentially not next year,'' and then the other was the 
question raised by him of having an income tax surcharge placed on 
people who pay the income tax to the tune of about $150 billion.

I believe you and others have said that surcharge will not be coming 
to the floor, and I wonder if you can verify that. And also any 
information you have about the likelihood of how we sustain our troops 
in the field between now and the end of the year.

I yield to my friend.
