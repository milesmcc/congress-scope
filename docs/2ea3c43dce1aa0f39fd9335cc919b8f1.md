Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a fallen soldier 
from my district, Specialist Joseph White from Bellevue, Washington. 
Joseph, recently married in 2009, was killed in action in Afghanistan 
on September 24.

Joe's mom talked about her son's dedication to his country in this 
way: ''Joe was not happy to be leaving his bride to go to Afghanistan, 
but he did not complain. Rather, he went with a strong sense of duty 
and desire to maintain freedom and safety for others.''

This body, this House of Representatives, this government and the 
people of this country could not exist without the dedication and 
sacrifice from the soldiers that serve, soldiers like Joe; soldiers 
who, above all else, want to honor this country and those who have gone 
before to protect our freedom and the freedom of their families.

There is nothing we can say or do that will take away the pain, the 
suffering, and the sense of loss that the family feels at the loss of 
their son Joe. But Joe's family must always remember, the memory of 
Specialist Joe White will remain, we will never forget, and we will 
continue to honor his sacrifice each day.
