`Mr. CARNAHAN â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, an interim report last week by the White 
House confirmed what most observers believe, that the situation in Iraq 
is not improving. The Iraqi Government has failed to meet the political 
benchmarks endorsed by the President last January. The Iraqi security 
forces continue to perform below expected levels. But the President 
continues to ask us stubbornly to stay the course.

At the same time, U.S. troops are overextended, many having served 
multiple tours in Iraq. This is unfair to our soldiers, their families, 
and dangerous for our national security. As Major General John Batiste 
recently noted, ''Iraq is distracting America from what should be the 
focus . . . It is in America's best interest to rethink our national 
strategy, deliberately disengage from Iraq, refit and rearm the 
military, get serious about homeland security, and prepare to win the 
next phase of the struggle.

Last week this House voted to do exactly that. This Democratic House 
joins with the American people and our retired generals in demanding a 
new direction in Iraq. This week the Senate can join us by supporting 
the Levin-Reed amendment.
