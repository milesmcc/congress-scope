Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support many of the priorities in this 
bill, and I do not think the Senate should extend debate on it 
indefinitely. But, if we invoke cloture on the bill, as it currently 
stands, we will be ensuring that it contains no language to bring our 
involvement in the Iraq war to a close. That would be a mistake. The 
war in Iraq is taking a tremendous toll on our servicemembers and our 
military preparedness--not to mention our national security and our 
pocketbook. It is irresponsible for Congress to pass legislation 
authorizing the activities of the Department of Defense that fails to 
bring our troops home and this war to an end.
