`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 28 March 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. The Trust for Public Land and Conservation Fund 
endorse. The Trust Alliance endorse what we are doing here. The U.S. 
Public Interest Research Group endorse what we are doing here. Veterans 
of Foreign Wars of the United States endorse what we are doing, because 
they are seeing the largest increase in commitment that so many Members 
of Congress have talked about over the years.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
These are the folks that work every day. These are the individuals that 
come in before we get here and leave after us. These are the works 
folks that know what it means to punch in and punch out.

The Audubon Society, Catholic Charities, the Committee for Education 
Funding, the Computer and Communications Industry Association, Catholic 
Health Association, Defenders of Wildlife, Disabled American Veterans.

These are the individuals, Mr. Ryan, and that is just, I can't go 
through all of the letters. We have the letters right here. I am not 
just reading from a sheet, just saying, well, I am just going to read. 
Anybody want to see this, they can stop by 1039 Longworth, and I will 
give them several copies of this. And, Mr. Speaker, they can run and 
take a look at them.

My Republican colleagues, some that I believe that will vote with us 
on this budget resolution, since it is so good and it is doing the 
right thing and it is not just about Iraq and Iraq and the other issue, 
Iraq. It is about domestic priorities. It is about making sure that our 
children have health care. It is about protecting the homeland. It is 
about all of the things and all of the reasons why we came to Congress. 
Not just to hear from the President and say, so shall it be written, so 
shall it be done.



So, Mr. Ryan, for you to get passionate about this, not that I am not 
passionate about it, but I think it is important that we share this 
accurate information with the people, with not only Members of Congress 
but the American people. So I am glad that you entered it into the 
Congressional Record. Those that may be able to get on-line or even get 
a copy of the Congressional Record will be able to see these great 
American organizations that will endorse.

And I know, Mr. Speaker, as this budget resolution, when we start 
moving through the process and the Senate product and we go into 
conference and we send it to the President of the United States, there 
will be a true momentum of the American spirit that will be rolling 
over to the White House on Pennsylvania. It will go right down the 
street here.

If the President wants to veto domestic priorities and things that 
are going to help Americans every day and be able to make sure that our 
military is strong and make sure that our veterans get better service 
that we promised them when they signed up as volunteers to protect this 
country, then we have to continue, Mr. Ryan and Members, to persuade 
the President to do otherwise. If he wants to veto it, we have to 
persuade him not to do it.

I am not going to say have at it. It would be okay if it wasn't the 
budget of the United States of America. It would be okay if it wasn't 
an emergency supplemental to make sure that our troops and men and 
women have what they need and accountability measures are in that 
emergency supplemental to hold the Iraqi government's feet to the fire, 
and what the administration has said, and making sure that our troops 
have what they need when they are sent into harm's way and make sure 
when they come back home that they are able to even go to their son or 
daughter's school without coming back in 6 weeks and 2 months being 
shipped back to Iraq for another 14-month tour. Because the 
administration, it takes them so long to admit that they have a 
problem. They just admitted 2 weeks ago, the Defense Department just 
called the conflict in Iraq a civil war after a year of the media and 
Members of Congress saying it was a civil war. They just got there, Mr. 
Ryan.


So the good thing about it is that, and in the last Congress we used 
to talk about if we had the opportunity to do. Now we have the 
opportunity, and we are doing, and I would just want the majority of 
this House to join us in the leadership opportunities that the American 
people have provided us. And I am not just talking to Democrats, Mr. 
Speaker, I am talking to my Republican colleagues.

Because, guess what? Maybe not this November but next November is 
going to be another opportunity for the American people to stand in 
judgment. And I guarantee you this: People are going to vote their 
personal priorities over their politics.

The President got out there today. They are going to get us. 
Terrorists are coming. We have to fight them there so we don't have to 
fight them over here. Well, guess what? When we passed and fully 
implemented the 9/11 recommendations, we are ready to protect America. 
That is what this budget reflects, and that is the way we protect the 
homeland, not continuing to stay in the middle of civil war.
