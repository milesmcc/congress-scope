`Mr. CONYERS â€” 11 January 2007`

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and congratulate the 
gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, and her partner from 
California for the great work that they have done here.

Ladies and gentlemen, I call your attention in this discussion 
tonight to what happened on Page 1 of the New York Times. And I read 
this to you for your consideration:

''Inviting a Battle on Capitol Hill. In making the effort to step up 
the American military presence in Iraq, President Bush invites an epic 
clash with the Democrats who run Capitol Hill, whose leader promised to 
force a vote on his plan. While Congress cannot force a change in the 
White House plan, Mr. Bush's initiative shows that he is ignoring the 
results of the November elections, rejecting the central thrust of the 
bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and flouting some of the advice of his own 
generals.



''The move is in essence a calculated gamble that no matter how much 
hue and cry his new strategy may provoke, in the end the American 
people will give Mr. Bush more time to turn around the war in Iraq.''

Well, ladies and gentlemen, my suggestion is that, after last night's 
performance, he is not going to be given more time by the American 
people and that, from a popularity rating at an all time low of 26, my 
prediction is that he will have fallen even lower as a result of last 
night's performance.

So I think that this is quickly turning into the President's war. 
There are those on all sides around him, including within the 
Republican Party, Members that will not go along any further. We have 
run out of steam. We have run out of illogic. We have looked through 
the exaggerations. So I conclude my remarks by just letting you hear 
about the editorial in the New York Times:

''We have argued that the United States has a moral obligation to 
stay in Iraq as long as there is a chance to mitigate the damage that a 
quick withdrawal might cause.'' This is the editorial. ''We have called 
for an effort to secure Baghdad, but as part of the sort of 
comprehensive political solution utterly lacking in Mr. Bush's speech. 
This war has reached the point that merely prolonging it could make a 
bad ending even worse. Without a real plan to bring it to a close, 
there is no point in talking about jobs programs and military offenses. 
There is nothing ahead but even greater disaster in Iraq.'' This is the 
media talking now.

It is time that the Executive branch recognize that the majority of 
the American people, most of the Congress, the media itself are all 
telling him that President Bush's private war is not going to go 
anywhere, and to deliberately refuse to accept the decision and 
determination of the American people on November 7 means that he is now 
stepping beyond the democratic process.

Madam leader, Ms. Waters, I thank you so much for yielding.
