# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `ddeb132bcea16f77cd103e4143afd0ae`

Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for the 
time. I appreciate being part of this discussion today.

Mr. Speaker, I couldn't help but be somewhat taken by Mr. Rangel's 
comments about the lack of urgency and the lack of sacrifice in our 
country because of what is going on with our troops in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and I can say to you, whoever is listening or watching, 
wherever you are, when I go through my communities, my towns, I sense 
the same thing. Where is the sense of urgency and where is the sense of 
sacrifice?

I will tell you where it is. When you go to see the troops off, to 
see their families, to see them, then you know where the sacrifice is. 
Then you know where the urgency is, to be there when they go back the 
second or third time, and, as some have said, the fourth.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, a 
resolution in support of our troops who are serving with distinction in 
Iraq, and opposing the President's call for escalating the troop levels 
in Iraq.

As a two-tour combat veteran of the Vietnam conflict, as Ike said, as 
an assault helicopter pilot, I, like many others in this body, know 
firsthand of the


everyday sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform serving in 
Iraq. And, I might add, if I could, I know the sacrifices of their 
spouses and children. Branded on me always will be the reminder of my 
children when I had to leave, and they wondered if their dad would come 
back. You can't forget that. And it is happening to our troops 
repeatedly. More than 3,100 have given the supreme sacrifice. Over 
20,000 have been injured, many of them very severely.

This resolution recognizes our brave men and women for performing 
their mission to the best of their ability. All Members of this body, 
all Members of this body stand foursquare behind their efforts.

As one Member of Congress who voted in support of the Iraq war 
resolution in 2002, I recognize the pretext for going to war was based 
on faulty, misleading, misinformation. I cannot reverse that vote, but 
I can no longer acquiesce to a failed and tragic military exercise in 
Iraq.

Two months ago, Generals Casey and Abizaid stated they did not 
support the increase in U.S. troop levels in Iraq, and recently 
President Bush maintained that that military policy with regard to Iraq 
would be determined by our military leaders. However, last month, 
President Bush ignored his top military advisers and called for a 
20,000-plus increase in U.S. troops in Iraq.

I and others have been pressing the administration to level with the 
American people on the status of the Iraqi Security Forces being 
trained and ready to defend their Nation. If the Iraqis are trained and 
ready, reportedly over 300,000, as we have been told, it is time to 
begin now a planned phased withdrawal of U.S. troops. Sending more U.S. 
troops to Iraq does nothing to enhance the Iraqis' training. It only 
places more U.S. forces into harm's way to become additional targets of 
the Iraqi civil war. This failed policy must stop. We can support our 
troops in the field and oppose this escalation of U.S. forces.

The sectarian civil war violence in Iraq is increasing, and U.S. 
troops are becoming an increasing target of the various tribes and 
factions. We cannot continue to place ourselves in the middle of this 
civil war. It is time to insist that the Iraqis resolve their own civil 
war. We must insist and allow the Iraqis to defend their own Nation. 
The Bush administration stated that Iraq Security Forces are trained 
and ready in sufficient numbers to do the job. Again, they stated over 
300,000 trained and equipped.

Therefore, I believe now is the time to oppose any further escalation 
of U.S. troop levels and now begin the planned, phased withdrawal of 
U.S. forces. I regret today's resolution is nonbinding. We need to 
begin addressing this matter in real substantive legislation. I urge 
all of my colleagues to support this resolution and to work in unison 
to bring our troops home.

Mr. Speaker, you know what we do best? You know what we do best? I 
will bet everybody who is paying attention intends to file their income 
tax April 15. We do best when we are under pressure to get it done.

I think it is time to say to Mr. Maliki, you know what? You have got 
your government in place. You have got your chance for democracy. It 
has been given to you. We went in there and Saddam is gone. He is 
history. You have got your chance. It is up to you. Now, you have got 
your problems, but you have got your government and it is in place. You 
have your problems, but you have to work them out. We cannot come in 
there and settle a civil war. And that is exactly what is going on.



We were, like you were there and I was with you in the White House, 
14 months ago when they said to the President, the Vice President, 
Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Rice and General Pace, if you have got at 
that time, 14 months ago, if you have got over 200,000 troops trained, 
equipped and in field, then what is your plan to bring our troops home? 
And just like now, silence fell in the room.

Now, the claim is over 300,000 trained and equipped in the field and 
we are not bringing ours home. So we should say to Mr. Maliki, you have 
got to do it, pick something, whether it is oil fields or pick 
something and say starting next week or the week after you are 
responsible for their security because we are going to bring our troops 
out and bring them home and we are going to take them to Baghdad, put 
them on airplanes and fly them home. You have got to do it. It is yours 
to do and we hold you responsible to do it.
