Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of language 
in this conference report that includes several critical provisions to 
aid the resettlement of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced 
persons.

First, I offer my sincere thanks to Chairman Skelton and Senator 
Kennedy for working to include this language in the conference report 
before us today.

Since our invasion, well over 4 million Iraqis have fled their homes 
as a result of political instability, economic catastrophe, and ethnic 
and sectarian strife.

Unable to legally find employment in their host countries, living in 
substandard housing with inadequate medical and educational facilities, 
many refugees simply have no place to turn.

While neighboring countries have struggled to cope with the strain of 
hosting millions of these refugees, our track record on refugee 
resettlement has been nothing short of an embarrassment.

As the refugee crisis unfolded in Iraq and its neighboring countries 
in the aftermath of our invasion, the Departments of State and Homeland 
Security stood by while a backlog of refugees referred by the United 
Nations for resettlement languished in the slums of Amman and other 
cities in the region.

This legislation will help make up for the administration's 
inexcusably lethargic pace by setting out clear refugee processing 
priorities, mandating the centralization of Iraq refugee efforts in the 
State Department, requiring greater cooperation with those allies in 
the region who are hosting many of these refugees, and increasing 
congressional oversight of refugee assistance and resettlement 
programs.

In addition, the language which we have worked together in great 
bipartisan fashion to include in this conference report also 
strengthens the Special Immigrant Visa program, for Iraqis who have 
worked for our Government and military in Iraq.

Many of these Iraqis who served bravely besides our troops and 
diplomats need our immediate assistance. Singled out as collaborators, 
they have been targeted by death squads, militias, and al-Qaeda.

Clearly, we owe them more than just a debt of gratitude. We owe them 
a safe haven and a fresh start.

While this legislation represents an important step forward in our 
commitment to these refugees, it cannot be the last word on the matter.

I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to help us 
live up to our commitments to these refugees.
