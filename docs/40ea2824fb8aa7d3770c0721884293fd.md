`Mr. DELAHUNT â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his concern and 
respect for the families and the soldiers that serve. He should know 
that there are many that are serving today in Iraq that agree with you.

Let me quote from a private in Baghdad who was shot at and who is 
enduring the vagaries and the vicissitudes of living every day in hell. 
This is what he had to say in a paper just recently.

''We can go get into a firefight and empty our ammo, but it doesn't 
accomplish much. This isn't our war. We're just in the middle.'' And 
that is Private First Class Zach Clausen.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. Shuler).
