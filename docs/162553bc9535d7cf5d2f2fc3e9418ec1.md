Mr. BOUSTANY. That peace is breaking out because of this plan that 
has been implemented. And we have seen dramatic results, yet those 
results are still fragile and still tenuous, as both Ambassador Crocker 
and General Petraeus have stated. But yet it is real progress, and we 
have an obligation to continue on this path so that we eventually see 
real stability in Iraq.
