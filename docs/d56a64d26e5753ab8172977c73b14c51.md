Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate an historic 
event that occurred in this Chamber 91 years ago during the middle of 
the Great War, the war to end all wars.

On January 10, 1918, this House passed a constitutional amendment 
granting women the right to vote by a vote of 274 to 136. 
Representative Jeanette Rankin from Montana, the first woman to serve 
in this body, whose statue appears in Statuary Hall and who became the 
first woman to serve in Congress in 1917, asked her male colleagues 
this important question in asking them to support that amendment: ''How 
shall we answer the challenge, gentlemen?''

Her question is worth repeating today as President Bush prepares to 
escalate the war in Iraq. We need to repeat her question: How shall we 
answer this challenge?
