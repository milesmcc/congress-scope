Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on September 25 the Central Intelligence 
Agency announced the creation of the CIA Center on Climate Change and 
National Security. I am proposing an amendment today to the fiscal year 
2010 Defense appropriations bill that would prevent funds in this bill 
from going to that center. The CIA is responsible for gathering foreign 
intelligence information for the United States. We have threats from 
around the world. The most immediate of these threats is the prevention 
of future terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. I do not believe that 
creating a Center on Climate Change is going to prevent one terrorist 
attack.

Why is this administration having our intelligence officials, the men 
and the women who protect this country, have these men and women staff 
and operate a climate change center? The creation of this center 
appears to elevate the issue of climate change to the level of 
terrorism and foreign espionage.

To me, this raises a number of questions. The CIA always claims to 
have scarce resources and competing priorities. What are the costs 
going to be of creating this new climate center? Isn't there a more 
efficient way to achieve the same results using existing resources? Why 
can't the CIA get this information through traditional channels, such 
as the State Department officials in the field, the EPA, the National 
Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, and other Federal agencies?

How does the CIA get information about other issues--world hunger, 
disease, financial markets--to make their decisions? Do they have 
centers for all of these issues as well? Is this center going to make 
demands on the current CIA bureaucracy? Will they use existing 
personnel? Will they hire new people? Will necessary personnel have 
tasking authority?

Tasking authority means the ability to take satellites off of 
watching terrorists and having them instead watching arctic ice sheets. 
Will someone sitting in a dark room watching satellite video of 
northern Afghanistan now be sitting in a dark room watching polar ice 
caps?

The priorities seem to be out of focus. I believe the Senate should 
support this amendment and bring the focus back in line with America's 
national security interests. The CIA has an important job to do. It 
must not be distracted by being forced to deal with climate change.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
