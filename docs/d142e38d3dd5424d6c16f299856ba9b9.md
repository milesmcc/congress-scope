Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, my fellow colleagues, sometime in the next 
week the House is going to be asked to make some decisions on energy 
policy. But I think we need to reflect on the last few years, and that 
is, the United States went into Iraq for one reason and one reason 
only, oil. And when we did that, the price of oil didn't go down, it 
went up.

That the oil companies are running our energy policy is not a secret 
in this country. They have kept oil off the market while they jacked up 
the price. They have helped to restrain the supply while the price has 
skyrocketed and the American families paid for that. So to give the oil 
companies more drilling rights is simply a guarantee that we are going 
to pay more for oil, not less. Wake up, America.
