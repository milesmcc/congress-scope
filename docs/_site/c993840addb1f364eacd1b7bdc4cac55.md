`Mr. INOUYE â€” 31 March 2009`

---


Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the budget resolution we are considering 
now proposes to increase discretionary nondefense spending by $35 
billion from the level approved in fiscal year 2009. My colleagues 
should all understand that this is $15 billion less than was requested 
by President Obama.

As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I am not particularly 
pleased that the resolution has cut the President's request by $15 
billion. We on the Appropriations Committee know that in order to meet 
the level proposed by the Budget Committee, we will have to make real 
cuts in the budget proposed by President Obama.

But I must say that I am surprised that we are now facing an 
amendment which would seek to cut discretionary spending even more. As 
I stand here, I find myself somewhat at a disadvantage to explain all 
the impacts that would occur if further cuts are made.

While we know the overall parameters of the President's budget, we do 
not yet have most of the details on the thousands of programs which 
will be reviewed in detail by the Appropriations Committee. That 
information is not available to the Congress at this moment. So we 
really do not know which programs that have been supported by the 
Senate in years past will be proposed for cuts or elimination. We do 
not know which fees or offsetting collections might be buried in the 
President's request that the Congress is likely to insist on 
eliminating, adding to the unfunded costs in the budget. We also know 
that nearly all of our colleagues will be asking for items that will 
not be included in the request. We know that many of you will be 
writing our various subcommittees urging that we adopt new programs and 
initiatives that might be incorporated in this budget. And we know this 
for sure: The committee will face a much larger burden than just 
identifying $15 billion that can be reduced by the President's request.

With the few details we have already received about the budget 
request, there are a few things that we know would result by freezing 
nondefense discretionary spending.

First, my colleagues should all be advised that the largest single 
increase in the domestic spending budget for fiscal year 2010 will be 
for the census. A $4.5 billion increase is necessary to meet our 
constitutional responsibility. This amount is needed in fiscal year 
2010. It cannot be delayed. The timeliness and accuracy of the census 
will be in jeopardy if we do not fund this amount.

Second, we are advised that the budget will include a $3.5 billion 
increase for the Veterans' Administration to cover the cost of medical 
care inflation, as well as projected increases in VA enrollment, and 
new initiatives such as the proposal to expand VA health care to over 
500,000 modest-income veterans.

Increased veterans health care services and specialty care services 
targeted at the growing population of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans 
include prosthetics, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, 
which would have to be curtailed if we freeze spending. Surely, the 
sponsors of this amendment do not want us to cut these needed increases 
for our veterans.

Madam President, if I may be personal at this juncture--and this is 
not in my prepared text--I had the privilege and honor of serving in 
the Army of the United States during World War II. I was literally a 
young boy. I was 18 when I got in. But I know a few things about that 
war.

My regiment, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, has been declared to 
be the most decorated unit of its size in World War II. It also had one 
of the highest casualty numbers of any war.

We began our battles in Italy in June of 1944, and the war ended in 
May of 1945. In those 11 months, we began our service with 5,000 men, 
infantry men. At the end of 11 months, over 12,000 had gone through the 
ranks, all brought about because of the necessity of replacements to 
replace those who had been wounded in action. So when our men got 
involved in a major battle--I remember one battle that lasted 5 days. 
At the end of the battle, our casualty rate was 800, and of that number 
250 dead. When you see these numbers, somehow Iraq becomes 
inconsequential: four today, three tomorrow. But at that time, times 
were a little different. For example, if I had been wounded in Baghdad, 
I would have been evacuated from that site of battle to the hospital 
within 30 minutes by helicopter.

On my last battle, when I received three wounds--my arm, my gut, my 
leg--I had to be evacuated by stretcher. Evacuation began at 3 o'clock 
in the afternoon. I got to the hospital at midnight--9 hours. So it 
sounds unbelievable, but with all the casualties we have had, not one 
double-amputee survived the war. And we had dozens of them, but they 
bled to death because of the long evacuation. Not one brain injury case 
survived because of the long evacuation. Not one spinal injury case 
survived because of the long evacuation. Today, they are all surviving, 
and this amount will cut it out. Help for them will disappear.

On a final note, I think about this and I chuckle. When I was taken 
to the hospital at midnight, we were put into a tent about half the 
size of this Chamber. Hundreds were lined up on stretchers, and teams 
of doctors and nurses would go down the line, look at the medical card, 
and whisper among themselves--and you could hear--''No. 1,'' ''No. 2,'' 
''No. 3.'' By the time it got to me--I sensed that ''No. 1'' meant: 
Send him immediately to the operating room; ''No. 2'' meant: Oh, his 
injury is not that serious, he can wait; ''No. 3'' was: You have done a 
good job for us. Thank you. So people would see the Chaplain going to 
all the No. 3's.

The Chaplain came to me. I did not know, but I was designated a No. 
3, and the Chaplain said: Son, God loves you.

I looked at the Chaplain, and I said: Chaplain, I know God loves me, 
but I am not ready to see Him yet.



So here I am.

What I am trying to say, is that in that war, seriously injured 
soldiers did not survive. And maybe in a sense, it is God's gift. I 
would hate to think of myself lying in bed the rest of my life looking 
at the ceiling.

But they survived, and I think it is our responsibility. This 
amendment would cut that out.

If I may proceed further, third, we know that the budget will include 
a $250 million increase to cut down on overpayments in Social Security. 
We know this from experience, that for every $1 we spend, we save $10 
in inappropriate payments. Isn't that a good investment? By spending 
$250 million, we are going to save billions. I thought the business was 
not in spending but in saving. We would lose more than $2 billion in 
mandatory savings by freezing discretionary funds.

Fourth, we have an amount of $183 million, which would be cut out. We 
are told by the Department of Agriculture that an additional $183.5 
million will be needed simply to maintain existing rental assistance 
agreements. This assistance provides subsidies to maintain affordable 
rent and utility costs for very low-income rural residents. Without 
this increase, 41,705 households will face substantial rent increases 
forcing many to leave, be evicted from their homes.


I know the sponsors are not seeking to force the poor from their 
homes.

Madam President, as you preside and as I speak, we should keep in 
mind that many of our fellow citizens are sweating out each day, not 
knowing whether he or she has a job tomorrow or whether they can keep 
up the payments on the mortgage or whether they can pay for health care 
or whether they can pay the rent. Without this, all hope is gone. The 
least we can do is to let them know we are here to help them get 
through this crisis.

Yes, there is another one.

Fifth, we know about potential accidents at airports. We know we do 
not have enough trained air traffic controllers. This resolution 
provides funds for that purpose, to train them so we may have safer 
traveling.

When I travel, which is not often enough, I go to Hawaii. It takes, 
just in flying time, 11 hours. I feel safe because I have confidence in 
our air traffic controllers. But many of them are now on the verge of 
retiring. We need a new crew. This budget resolution provides the funds 
for training them.

The FAA faces a crisis in maintaining an adequate workforce of 
trained air traffic controllers with a freeze in nondefense 
discretionary spending for 2010, the FAA would be forced to freeze or 
reduce the number of new air traffic controllers the agency can bring 
on board and train--worsening the experience shortage we already have 
in our air traffic control towers. With a freeze in funding, the FAA 
also would be unable to settle an ongoing dispute over the terms of its 
contract with its air traffic controllers. This dispute has hurt the 
agency's productivity and its ability to retain experienced 
controllers, who are essential to training the agency's newly hired 
controllers.

Sixth, the section 8 tenant-based account provides critical resources 
to help the Nation's most vulnerable families find and maintain safe 
and affordable housing in the private market. Congress provides annual 
funding adjustments for this program to cover housing cost increases, 
so that all families served by the program can maintain their housing. 
If nondefense discretionary spending were frozen in fiscal year 2010, 
housing agencies wouldn't have the necessary resources to cover these 
increased costs. As a result, tens of thousands of families could be at 
risk of losing their housing.

Seventh, we know that because of high food costs and other factors, 
the overall cost of the WIC program has already increased dramatically. 
In fiscal year 2009, $760,000,000 above the budget request was required 
to keep people from losing WIC benefits. A freeze on spending could 
cause no new participation, waitlists, and could potentially cause some 
people to lose benefits.

As I noted earlier, we simply do not have all the details of the 
budget to be able to explain to our colleagues all the harm that a 
freeze on discretionary spending will do.

Nonetheless, I believe from the information that we have already 
received that I just listed it is clear that we simply cannot sustain 
additional cuts in the request.

These economic times are tough. But in tough times our people count 
on the Federal Government for more services.

Each day as more wage earners lose their jobs, more of them become 
eligible for many of the assistance programs which I have highlighted. 
Many of these programs are designed to help people in need during 
difficult economic times.

Our efforts to reduce spending here will result in an even greater 
reliance on mandatory programs such as welfare rolls, food stamps, and 
public assistance.

For these reasons I must oppose the amendment from the Senator from 
Alabama, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.

Madam President, as I said, I am going to vote against this 
amendment. It is a bad amendment. It is not American.
