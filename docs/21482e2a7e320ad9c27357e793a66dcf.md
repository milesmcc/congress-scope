Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I want to recognize and thank the 
Helmets to Hardhats program for its important work on behalf of our 
Nation's veterans.

In these tough economic times, unemployment among recent veterans is 
a growing concern. Recent statistics indicate that the jobless rate 
among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans tracks a full five points higher 
than the rate for the Nation as a whole. It is clear that we must take 
serious steps to address this issue.

The Helmets to Hardhats program has helped tens of thousands of 
veterans find work in the construction industry by evaluating recently 
separated servicemembers to identify their strengths and experience and 
match them with employers within the construction industry. The long-
term partnerships that result benefit veterans, construction firms, and 
the Nation as a whole.

In times of crisis, it is our best and bravest that step forward in 
defense of our Nation. We owe our servicemembers a debt of gratitude 
for their sacrifice that we can never fully repay. The least that a 
grateful nation can do is to give them assistance in finding good jobs 
when they return from service.

Though the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs do excellent 
work with their transition programs, organizations like Helmets to 
Hardhats serve as the ''boots on the ground'' forces needed to help our 
veterans realize the American dream. I thank all of those involved in 
this important organization for their work across the country, and look 
forward to partnering with them to help veterans in North Dakota.
