# PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 4899,  SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010

`Mr. POMEROY â€” 1 July 2010`

Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule 
allowing for consideration of House amendments to H.R. 4899, the 
Supplemental Appropriations Act.

I believe that it is irresponsible of Congress to leave for the 
Fourth of July recess without sending the Senate-passed supplemental 
appropriations bill to the President's desk for signature. Insisting on 
inclusion of additional spending above the Senate-passed supplemental 
levels, with absolutely no assurances that the Senate is willing or 
even able to pass this additional spending will do nothing but delay 
vitally important emergency funding.

Swift approval of the supplemental is needed not only for the war 
effort but also for areas of the United States, like North Dakota, who 
have been hit hard by disasters and desperately need Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) disaster relief funding owed them. While I do 
not take issue with the additional offset spending that is being 
discussed, the current push to add it will result in Congress failing 
to enact a supplemental for several weeks, with the strong possibility 
of ending up right back where we began.

I am submitting, as a part of my statement, a copy of an editorial 
that recently ran in the Bismarck Tribune titled ''Congress needs to 
meet its responsibilities''. Congress' inability to complete even its 
most basic business has the American people's patience running thin. 
The delay in passing a supplemental appropriations bill endangers our 
soldiers fighting overseas and is preventing critical aid from reaching 
those who have been hit with disasters here at home. We must act today 
to pass the Senate version of this bill and avoid further delays.

Congress Needs To Meet Its Responsibilities




 Mor-Gran-Sou Electric, crippled by the Good Friday 


 snowstorm, qualified for financial disaster relief from the 


 Federal Emergency Management Agency.



 The damage to Mor-Gran-Sou poles and lines was extensive 


 and pricey, upwards of $30 million.



 The feds agreed to pick up 75 percent of the cost. That's 


 what disaster relief programs are all about--financial help 


 when a natural disaster levels an area.



 Except, the check isn't in the mail.



 When the feds, when anyone, says they are going to do a 


 thing, they ought to do it--and do it in a timely fashion.



 There's no excuse for FEMA, and really Congress, holding up 


 Mor-Gran-Sou.



 And the phrase ''holding up'' isn't just a metaphor. While 


 waiting for FEMA, Mor-Gran-Sou has had to get a $30 million 


 line of credit, which even at 2.5 percent interest could cost 


 the co-op and its electric customers $1 million in interest 


 over a year.



 The FEMA disaster funding was placed in the bill funding 


 the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.



 One has nothing to do with the other. Lumping these funding 


 efforts together is just another political tool--like the 


 ''Christmas tree'' building bills in the North Dakota 


 Legislature--for forcing lawmakers to vote in favor of 


 something they do not want in exchange for something they 


 need.



 A congressman might not want to fund the war in Afghanistan 


 or Iraq, but if that congressman wants disaster relief, well 


 . . .



 Congress has intentionally become a beast of complexity and 


 burden, in this case.



 Legislation, rather than being a clean, well-written policy 


 or law with a single given purpose, has become 


 incomprehensible in language, sheer volume and related 


 programming, regulating and funding.



 Yes, we live in a complex world and over simplification can 


 be dangerous, but that's not justification for the present 


 level of congressional chaos.



 Congress has legislated FEMA's obligation in a natural 


 disaster. FEMA has deemed Mor-Gran-Sou's situation as 


 qualified for help.



 Now Congress must follow through and provide funding to do 


 what it said FEMA would do.



 In Washington, a million dollars in interest might not 


 amount to much, but on the far end of a power line in western 


 North Dakota, with 11,000 downed poles and 550 miles of 


 tangled line, it's a very big deal.



 In people, follow-through of this kind, speaks to 


 character. The same goes for Congress and its members.



 Our delegation needs to push hard to break this log jam. 


 Will it?
