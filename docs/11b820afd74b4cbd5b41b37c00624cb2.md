Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this summer, we had grim numbers coming 
out of Iraq and we had an election and we went through a soul-searching 
analysis of what to do. By an 80-to-14 vote, this Senate voted to send 
General Petraeus to Iraq and give him a chance to succeed. We had his 
full report in September. We had other reports from General Jones and 
GAO, and we concluded to continue this.

In recent weeks, progress has exceeded what we could have expected 
possible. This is not the right time to tie the hands of our military 
leaders. It is not the right thing to do--to leave any doubt that we 
are going to support the troops we have sent into harm's way.

I urge colleagues to not leave our troops in uncertainty and stand 
firm with a policy that seems to be working. Let's continue to monitor 
it. If it fails, we need to know that. But, right now, things are going 
well, and it would be wrong to undermine that in any way.
