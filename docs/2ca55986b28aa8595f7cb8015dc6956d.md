Mr. BILBRAY. Madam Speaker, I submit the following.

Requesting Member: Congressman Brian Bilbray

Bill Number: H.R. 3326--Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 
2010

Account: USAF, Research and Development

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: General Atomics Aeronautical Systems

Address of Requesting Entity: 14200 Kirkham Way, Poway CA 92064

Description of Request: I was able to secure $1,500,000 million for 
the Predator C. In July 2008, I took a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan to 
assess the current conditions on the ground. In a meeting with General 
David D. McKiernan, former Commander of International Security 
Assistance Force (ISAF) and former Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan 
(USFOR-A), he emphasized that the most important tools needed to 
successfully conduct operations are more ''eyes in the sky,'' also 
known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Most importantly, this request 
will help save lives through better intelligence gathering and greater 
strike capabilities. Furthermore, Predator C means more jobs 
contributing to San Diego's local economy. Predator C will provide the 
USAF and other customers with an additional covert capability, enhanced 
by much higher operational and transit speeds for quick response and 
quick repositioning for improved mission flexibility and survivability.
