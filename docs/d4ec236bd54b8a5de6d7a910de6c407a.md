`Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California â€” 24 April 2008`

Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the 
gentleman from Mississippi, and before we begin our debate on the Coast 
Guard Authorization Act for 2008, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume for the purposes of a colloquy with Mr. Thompson.

Mr. Thompson, would you please join me in remembering the sacrifice 
of Damage Controlman Third Class Nathan B. Bruckenthal of the U.S. 
Coast Guard, who was killed off the coast of Iraq on this date in 2004? 
He was the first U.S. Coast Guardsman to have been killed in battle 
since the end of the Vietnam War.

I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi.
