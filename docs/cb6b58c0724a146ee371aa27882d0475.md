`Mrs. BOXER â€” 28 June 2007`

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am voting present on the nomination of 
Douglas E. Lute to be Special Assistant to the President and Deputy 
National Security Adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan.

Although I respect General Lute's distinguished 30-plus year career 
in the U.S. Army, I view this position as rearranging the bureaucracy 
at the White House. The creation of a ''war czar'' will not hide the 
President's failed policies and is another way for him to duck 
responsibility for the war in Iraq.
