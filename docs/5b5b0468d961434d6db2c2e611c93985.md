Mr. FILNER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

This resolution, 1231, supports the goals and ideals of Vietnam 
Veterans Day. I don't think we have to remind this body that the 
Vietnam war was a very divisive time in this country. One of the 
lessons that we should draw from Vietnam is that although we may 
disagree about a war, as we do about the current one in Iraq, we must 
never, never disagree about the importance of honoring the service and 
sacrifice of the men and women who serve our Nation. We must never 
confuse the war with the warrior. We must never, never forget the 
warrior.

This war that we are engaging in Iraq is only exceeded in its length 
by America in the Vietnamese war, the longest conflict in our history. 
More than 3 million Americans served in southeast Asia. More than 
58,000 Americans lost their lives on the battlefield. Over 300,000 
Americans were wounded, and that was at the time of the war itself. We 
know because we did not honor these heroes when they came home and we 
did not have the resources in place, especially with regard to mental 
health, that we inflicted a terrible, terrible future on many of those 
soldiers.

Half of the homeless on the street tonight are Vietnam veterans. We 
think that there are more suicides by Vietnam veterans than who died on 
the original battlefield. That's a terrible, terrible blot on America 
for not honoring our veterans. And certainly we cannot make the same 
mistake again with those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.

So we have a Vietnam memorial. We must always remember the service 
and sacrifices. A day of remembrance is a particularly fitting way to 
remember the painful lessons learned. But we could do some more 
material things, too, and I hope that the cooperation and goodwill 
shown by my ranking member at all times will make sure that we up the 
budget, for example, to deal with the homeless veterans on the street--
most of them are Vietnam veterans--that we grant their Agent Orange 
claims that they have fought for for decades, that we provide some 
security for them and increase the budget that is aimed at their future 
as citizens in this Nation.

So yes, let us pass this resolution. But let us move on in the 
context of the budget and in the context of other legislation to really 
honor these warriors who, when they came home, did not get that honor.

I will reserve the balance of my time.
