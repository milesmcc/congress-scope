`Mr. LAUTENBERG â€” 1 August 2007`

---


Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are going to soon be voting on an 
amendment proposed by Senator Bunning. I rise to register my opposition 
to that amendment, and I hope my colleagues will follow me.

I come to the floor to defend the health and well-being of 3,000 
children in the State of New Jersey who would have their children's 
health insurance stripped away from them by the Bunning amendment.

Our mission this week is to pass a bill to expand health coverage for 
our Nation's children. But instead of focusing on providing more 
coverage for children, the Senator from Kentucky has targeted 3,000 
children in my State to take their coverage away.

None of us has any asset we treasure more than our children. None of 
us enjoys anything more than the smiles of our kids when they are 
feeling good and are in good health. That is why, when we see an 
attempt to remove health care from a modest-income family's children, 
who care so deeply about them, I wonder what it is that we are truly 
about.

This amendment is an assault on children from working families who 
require health care coverage. To think that while we spend $3 billion 
each and every week on the Iraq war, there is an unwillingness to 
provide the necessary funding to keep all our kids healthy regardless 
of their income situation. This one focuses on modest-income people. It 
is amazing that while we pledge to protect our people from harm, we 
shun the opportunity to shelter our children.

I wish to make our request clear to my colleagues, and I want them to 
recognize that we in New Jersey always


pay our way fully; we more than pay for the incredibly high cost of 
living in New Jersey. Our health care costs are among the highest in 
the Nation. Keeping our people healthy is a primary mission in our 
State. We have had stem cell research going back decades. Our 
pharmaceutical companies constantly research for new medicines to 
benefit the well-being of people across this country and the world.

The Bush administration has recognized the higher costs in New Jersey 
and explicitly granted our State the right to provide health care to 
children at the level it currently does. New Jersey is not trying to 
beat the system or get health coverage for its children in a way that 
is unfair to other States--not at all. The State of New Jersey is 
legitimately trying to provide health insurance to children, 
recognizing the distinct economic characteristics of our State.

The Bunning amendment is particularly discouraging, given New 
Jersey's support when it comes to helping other States in need. We know 
that other States have different needs than we do, and we have unique 
challenges we face as well. Time and again, New Jersey taxpayers are 
asked to shoulder the burden and help other areas of the country that 
are in need. In fact, for every dollar New Jersey gives to the Federal 
Government, we only get back 55 cents in Federal spending programs. 
Compare that with States such as Kentucky, for example, which for every 
dollar paid gets $1.45 back. Some States get up to $2 back for each 
dollar they pay.

Whether it is the universal service fund for telephones, essential 
air service in aviation or other programs, New Jersey gives far more 
than it gets back.

I want to be clear. I support many of these programs for other 
States. I recognize this occurs because New Jersey is a State with a 
higher-than-average income and higher-than-average costs compared to 
other States.

But we care as much about our children as other people do across the 
country. More than anything, we want our kids to be healthy.

There are 3,000 children in New Jersey who are depending on Senators 
to oppose the Bunning amendment--3,000 children who are looking to all 
of us to let them continue to have health care.

The Bunning amendment is contrary to everything we are trying to 
accomplish on the floor this week. If that amendment is adopted, this 
bill will be tainted with the legacy of taking health insurance away 
from children who need it but whose families cannot afford to supply it 
on their own.

I have many families who come in to see me and bring their children 
with them. I welcome them with open arms. There is nothing I find more 
satisfying than to see parents and their children together. They come 
in often with diseases that are difficult, such as autism, diabetes, 
and asthma. Not only do these children require a lot of love, 
affection, and attention but, unfortunately, very often it is at a cost 
that few families can bear. I want to help those kids, those families, 
and I reach out to them in any way I can. I want stem cell research to 
be available. I want more money spent on general health research.

I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment on a bipartisan 
basis. I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking 
member for the work they did. They overwhelmingly rejected the 
amendment of the Senator from Kentucky on a bipartisan vote. This 
amendment that has been authored by the Senator from Kentucky flies in 
the face of the good judgment of the Finance Committee. I hope my 
colleagues will reject this amendment, the Bunning amendment, once 
again when it gets to the Senate floor.

I am pleased to yield the floor.
