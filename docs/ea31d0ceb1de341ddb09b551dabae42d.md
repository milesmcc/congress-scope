Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume.

Madam Speaker, every time I visit military installations I am 
constantly impressed by the tremendous job our servicemembers are 
doing.

Today, I rise to pay special tribute to the women of America's 
military, past and present, who have served their Nation in peace and 
at war at great personal sacrifice for both themselves and their 
families.

With Veterans Day approaching, we should recognize that our 
servicewomen play an increasingly important role in America's modern 
military forces, and our country is the better for it.

As Chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military 
Personnel and co-Chair of the Women's Caucus Task Force on Women in the 
Military and Veterans, I am privileged to honor the legacy of 
servicewomen in the past, the courage with which women serve today, and 
the enthusiasm of the young women who dream of serving this great 
Nation in the future. Part of honoring them is asking the tough 
questions about the expanding roles our servicewomen are taking on. We 
hear from women in the military, in person and through the media, about 
their contributions in combat zones and their willingness to risk their 
lives in defense of their fellow servicemembers, our country, and our 
families.

Last year, Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity to meet a group of 
servicewomen that are an extraordinary example of what female 
servicemembers are capable of. Their mission is to provide culturally 
sensitive search and engagement activities for combat units deployed in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. They are referred to as the Lionesses, and this 
is a very apt name. Like a lioness, their work demands a unique 
combination of sensitivity and strength on the ground, underlined by 
loyalty to their units and their country.

In my conversations with them, I was astounded by their work and 
their bravery. And yet, despite that dedication, these women have 
encountered difficulties in gaining proper recognition for their 
service, both within the services and in seeking assistance from the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.

A recent article in the New York Times underscores this problem. 
Female veterans worry that their combat-related physical and 
psychological injuries will not be validated by a military system that 
defines combat as an all-male activity. Because the military and the VA 
have not adapted to the reality of women's roles, these veterans often 
have to work harder than they should to prove their eligibility for 
benefits and combat titles that they so greatly deserve. For example, 
servicewomen who volunteered to accompany units during the Battle of 
Fallujah in 2004 have had to rely on the support of an outside 
organization to get recognized for their work under fire so that they 
can receive health care and disability benefits from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs.

Yet, it's not just agencies that must catch up. Female veterans 
confront confusion and sometimes outright disbelief about their service 
from those of us on the homefront. This continuous demand for proof can 
be exasperating. They deserve better. One veteran explained that she no 
longer cared about getting money; she simply wanted a little more 
recognition. In her own words, ''Just admit it happened.''

Resolutions like this one today before the House help show support 
for women like the Lionesses and all of the other female servicemembers 
and veterans, but it is legislation like the National Defense 
Authorization Act that truly puts our congressional sentiments into 
action.

Last week, I had the chance to stand by the President as he signed 
the NDAA into law. Contained in the House report of that bill were 
provisions to better recognize the service of these courageous women by 
reviewing the way the additional duties some servicemembers perform are 
documented.



There were also provisions to ensure a systematic training program 
that takes into account the unique mission for which Lionesses have 
volunteered so that they feel just as equipped as their male 
counterparts when on active duty.

I will continue to work to ensure women in the military are treated 
equally and with respect, and that they receive all of the training, 
the support, and the services that they need. They certainly deserve 
nothing less.

The dedication of women in the Armed Forces and the insight they 
offer about it is invaluable, but they are adamant that they do not 
want to be treated differently. They do not seek special recognition, 
but their service is just as real as their counterparts'. This 
resolution recognizes the sacrifices our servicewomen and their 
families make to keep everyone's family safe.

Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to offer this 
resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

I reserve the balance of my time.
