Mr. LEVIN. The Senate spoke even before it adopted the amendment of 
the Senator from Virginia. So we have spoken in many ways over the 
years. But now it is our belief, those of us who support this 
amendment, that the earlier we put pressure on the Iraqi leaders to 
reach a political solution, which everybody agrees is the only hope, 
the earlier we put that pressure on them, the better.
