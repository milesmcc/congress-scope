Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That is what I am 
attempting to do.

The question in the point of order has to do with germaneness and the 
relevance of my motion to recommit to the underlying bill with respect 
to the Iraq resolution. That is what I'm trying to explain to the 
House. If my colleague from Missouri would give me a little latitude, I 
will continue to explain.
