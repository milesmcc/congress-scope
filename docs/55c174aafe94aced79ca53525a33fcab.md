Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation 
because where continuity is merited, we have continuity, and where 
change is demanded, we have change.

The continuity comes from the fact of a bipartisan consensus to 
provide every dollar that our troops in the field need, and this bill 
does that. That will not change. What must change, though, is the 
abrogation of constitutional responsibility by the erstwhile majority.

For over 3/1/2/ years, the erstwhile majority, Mr. Speaker, 
vacillated between apology and inaction. Yes, the President is the 
Commander in Chief, but no President should be the sole source of law 
and judgment. And for nearly 4 years, the erstwhile majority sat 
silently by as the quagmire deepened. That is changing under this 
legislation.

What also must change is the policy itself. We have been asked what 
our plan was. Here it is. We say to the Iraqis, you promised to pass an 
oil law. Pass it. You promised to have local elections. Have those 
elections. You promised to stand up your own security and police 
forces. Put them into the fight. If you succeed, we will then stay for 
an 18-month period of time to facilitate your success, but if you fail, 
the days of the blank check and the endless commitment are over.

The erstwhile majority, Mr. Speaker, has a hard time recognizing this 
plan because they have no plan. Their only approach is to ratify the 
failure of the status quo. The troops in the field and the American 
people deserve much, much better, and that is what this legislation 
provides.

I urge a ''yes'' vote.
