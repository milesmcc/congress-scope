`Mr. HELLER of Nevada â€” 4 August 2007`

---


Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Madam Speaker, the State of Nevada that I 
represent is home to 6 of the finest soldiers that I have ever met. On 
my recent trip to Iraq, the last week of July 2007, I had the honor to 
meet and talk with SGT Anthony Monger, SPC Richard Cook, PFC Joshua 
Campbell, SSG John Tripp, SPC Lacy Montgomery, and PFC Cory Ward.

As we all know, war is never easy and the people who make the 
greatest sacrifices during these difficult times are the brave men and 
women of our Armed Services. Very often this means service members are 
deployed for extended periods of time away from their friends, family, 
and children. America must remain committed to our soldiers, and I pray 
for the safe return of every Nevadan and soldier of the United States.

Generations of Nevadans will enjoy greater peace and security because 
of the tireless sacrifices of soldiers like Anthony, Richard, Joshua, 
John, Lacy, and Cory. I am honored to have met these soldiers and 
commend their service and bravery.
