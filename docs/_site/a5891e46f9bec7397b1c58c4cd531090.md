Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman from California, my colleague from 
the Rules Committee. And he points out that, yes, I think a legitimate 
question, how are we going to pay for this? I can't help but think that 
when it comes to giving people freedom and the right to vote, we must 
find a way to pay for it. In fact, we have spent $400 billion 
attempting to give the people in Iraq freedom and the right to vote. 
And if we can spend $400 billion in Iraq, then we can spend some money 
here to give the 600,000 people here in the District of Columbia the 
right to vote.
