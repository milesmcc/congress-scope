Mr. MURTHA. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the accomplishments of 
Special Agent James G. Macfarlane, currently the Deputy Inspector 
General and Deputy Assistant Director for the Office of Inspections of 
the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, NCIS. He will retire on March 
1, 2007, after more than 23 years of service to our great Nation.

Jim began his career as a special agent with the then Naval 
Investigative Service in 1983 as a general crimes investigator at 
Portsmouth, VA. Special Agent Macfarlane was then selected as the 
Special Agent Afloat aboard the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) in June 
1985. While serving aboard the JFK, Jim helped arrange law enforcement 
and force protection support required as the JFK was selected to 
participate in the rededication of the Statue of Liberty and the first 
naval ''OPSAIL'' celebration in New York City.

In 1986, Jim was selected as the Representational Resident Agent 
(RRA) at the Naval Investigative Service resident Unit in Misawa, 
Japan. In 1989, Jim was reassigned to NCIS Headquarters and worked in 
the Offensive Counterintelligence Operations Division, where he served 
with distinction for 5 years. During this time, SA Macfarlane was 
selected to attend Strategic Arms Reduction Training and deployed to 
Votkinsk, Russia, for 3 weeks in 1992 as the inspection team's CI 
specialist. In January 1994, Jim was selected to attend the Military 
Operations Training Course. In May 1994, he was reassigned as senior 
special agent working counterintelligence cases in Okinawa, Japan.

In 1996, Jim was selected as a Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) and 
began his first supervisory assignment at the NCIS Washington DC Field 
office where he provided Counterintelligence support to Navy special 
access programs. In 1997, Jim established the NCIS office at the Naval 
Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren, VA, where he was cited by DoD for 
setting the standard in providing Counterintelligence support to Navy 
Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RTD&E) programs. In 1999, 
Jim returned to the Washington DC field office, where he became the SSA 
for all offensive CI activities. In 2000, he was selected as the SSA 
for the Office of Special Projects and in August 2001, Jim was promoted 
to GS-14 and selected as the Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge (ASAC), 
NCIS Middle East Field Office, in Manama Bahrain.

Jim served as the sole ASAC during a period of great national 
interest and military activity, supporting both OPERATIONS ENDURING 
FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM. Jim brought great credit upon himself and 
the NCIS during his tenure in the Middle East and was awarded the 
Superior Civilian Service Award.

In July 2003, Jim was promoted to GS-15 and assigned as the Senior 
NCIS Representative to Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC). For his 
significant efforts at HQMC, he was awarded the Marine Corps' 
Meritorious Civilian Service Award. In 2005, Jim was selected for his 
current position as the Deputy Inspector General.

I wish to express my gratitude to Special Agent MacFarlane for his 
many years of distinguished service to this country.
