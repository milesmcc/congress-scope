Mr. REID. Mr. President, every morning I get up and do my exercise. 
It takes me about an hour to go out and do what I do in the morning. 
This morning was very cold. I listen to the radio. I listen to the news 
every morning. It is with a heavy heart that I finished my exercise 
this morning and came into my home and got ready to come to work.

Nine American soldiers were killed in Iraq yesterday. I don't know 
how many were wounded. I don't know how many were grievously wounded. 
But I have to focus on those nine soldiers and their families.

I am fortunate. I am one of four sons. My brother Dale died as a 
young man, and I still have not gotten over my brother Dale dying at 
46, 47 years old. I know his death is not comparable, of course, to 
these valiant soldiers who were killed in Iraq yesterday, but he is 
still my brother and I still feel very badly.

I can't imagine how the nine soldiers' families feel today. Some of 
them have not yet been notified that their loved one has been killed, 
but most of them by now have been notified. This is a reminder of what 
is happening in Iraq thousands of miles from here but affecting the 
lives of everyday Americans. The current approach isn't working. We 
need to change course in Iraq.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
