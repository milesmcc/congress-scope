Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I would like to ask a very 
pointed question. And I think I know the answer, but I want to get his 
opinion. Does the Senator from Virginia believe that today this 
administration is using military force in Iraq beyond the scope of our 
authorization for the use of force in October of 2002?
