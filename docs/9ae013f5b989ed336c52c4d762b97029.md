Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, yesterday in this House, we 
took a great first step forward, I think, in finding bipartisan common 
ground on the way forward in Iraq with the passage of H.R. 3087.

The issue of our troop presence in Iraq has caused great debate 
across our country; it has polarized this Congress and our Nation. I 
believe this first step is a demonstration that a bipartisan way 
forward can happen. In fact, it must happen for the good of our Nation 
and our ultimate success in Iraq. We can draw that day closer if we in 
this Congress and we in America continue to work together to forge 
consensus instead of resorting to partisan attacks.

The report of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker last month has 
given us reason for hope that progress is being made and our troops can 
begin returning home. As our troops so bravely continue their mission, 
let us continue ours and build upon the momentum that we started 
yesterday in this House. Let us all hope that the day is coming soon 
when our troops, who have protected our Nation and exported liberty, 
freedom and democracy, will come home. We owe them nothing less than 
our best effort to make this hope a reality.
