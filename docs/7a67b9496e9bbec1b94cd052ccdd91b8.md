Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, it is becoming clear day by day that the 
President's troop escalation plan is not in the best interest of this 
Nation.

First, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the 
President's troop escalation plan would take substantially more troops 
and more money than the President has suggested.

The President says 21,500 troops are needed; the CBO says 48,000 
troops are necessary to conduct the mission. The President says it will 
cost about $5.6 billion, but CBO says that the number could be four 
times higher than that.

Second, the administration's intelligence agencies concluded last 
week that violence would continue in Iraq for at least another 18 
months, but the President says his plan will calm the violence in 6 
months.

And, third, Pentagon officials admitted last week that they do not 
have enough armored vehicles, armored kits and other equipment needed 
to protect these additional troops.

Mr. Speaker, after hearing these three different facts, how can 
anyone believe the President's troop escalation plan is in the best 
interests of this country?

On that note, I yield back.
