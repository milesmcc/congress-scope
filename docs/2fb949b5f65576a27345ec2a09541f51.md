# U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,
## `2fb949b5f65576a27345ec2a09541f51`
`Mr. HAGEL â€” 27 March 2007`

Mr. HAGEL. America finds itself in a dangerous and isolated position 
in the world. We are perceived as a nation at war with Muslims. This 
debilitating and dangerous perception must be reversed as the world 
seeks a new center of gravity for this new century. The United States 
must begin planning for a phased troop withdrawal from Iraq. The cost 
of combat in Iraq in terms of American lives, dollars, and world 
standing has been devastating for our country.

The American people are demanding that we develop a bipartisan 
consensus for an honorable and responsible exit strategy from Iraq. If 
we fail to build a bipartisan foundation for an exit strategy, America 
will pay a high price for this blunder--one we will have difficulty 
recovering from in the years ahead.

Our actions today in the Congress begin this effort.

Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.
