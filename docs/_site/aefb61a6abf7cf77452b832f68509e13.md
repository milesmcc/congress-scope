Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, what a deaf President we have. The American 
people told him loud and clear on November 7 that we want to change 
course in Iraq. He doesn't hear them.

The Iraq Study Group told him loud and clear we must change course in 
Iraq and certainly not escalate; he doesn't hear them.

His generals tell him that more troops won't do any good, will simply 
increase American casualties; he hears them, but he fires them and gets 
generals that will tell him what he wants to hear.

There is nothing more clear today than that the civil war in Iraq is 
a civil war, that there is no function for the United States to try to 
help one side against the other in that civil war. Indeed, one could 
make the case we picked the wrong side, and that we must withdraw our 
troops. We must tell the Iraqis that we are withdrawing, and we are 
withdrawing on a timetable. You make a deal with each other, you live 
together or fight your own civil war, we are not going to do it for 
you.

Mr. Speaker, for that we should not escalate. We should pass 
legislation in this Congress saying funds that are appropriated can be 
used only to protect the troops and to withdraw them.
