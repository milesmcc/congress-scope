# TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE ACT, A GOOD GOVERNMENT TAX BILL

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, as millions of Members filled out their tax 
returns this week, many were concerned that their hard-earned tax 
dollars will be sent straight to Iraq. We have already spent $44 
billion rebuilding Iraq, and the war costs our Nation about $12 billion 
a month.

We have families struggling here at home that can't pay their bills, 
are losing their homes, don't have health care, and the Bush 
administration is spending $12 billion a month on a war that shows no 
end in sight and no plans for success.

Our monthly investment in Iraq translated into approximately $339 
million every single day. Taxpayers are probably wondering how could we 
better invest that money here in the United States. The $339 million we 
spend in Iraq a day could provide 48,000 homeless veterans with a place 
to live or we can assure 317,000 kids receive their vaccinations and 
live a healthy life.

House Democrats vow to fight to ensure that American tax dollars are 
used to rebuild America, not Iraq.
