`Mr. HATCH â€” 7 February 2007`

---


Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the debate over whether we should be 
supporting or withdrawing our support from the President's plan to 
surge over 20,000 more troops into Iraq, I am acutely aware of one 
overriding irony. Those who are seeking to begin the withdrawal from 
Iraq are committing the same conceptual error that many of the same 
critics have accused the administration of committing when they made 
their flawed plans for the invasion of Iraq. They are not thinking 
about what will happen on the day after we begin our withdrawal.

Let me say that the situation in which we find ourselves today in 
Iraq is certainly in part due to the administration's failure to 
anticipate many variables in the Iraqi theater, in the region, and in 
Iraqi society. Those who prepared only for the military defeat of 
Saddam's forces committed such a profound error that it will be a 
lesson learned in the history books long after we are gone.

We did not prepare for the vehemence with which certain elements of 
the displaced Sunni elite would fight to retain their status quo.

We did not anticipate how fractured and weak the oppressed Shia 
society of Iraq would be once the dictator was deposed, and we did not 
appreciate how unprepared the Shia would be to present true leadership.

And we did not anticipate, because we apparently did not plan for 
this, that a political and leadership vacuum created by the fall of 
Saddam would invite the influence of Iran, whose interests in Iraq are 
anything but charitable.

The mistakes that we have read so much about--the failure to secure 
massive ammunition dumps, the peremptory disbanding of the Iraqi army, 
the sweeping de-Baathification policies that alienated many Sunnis not 
directly responsible for the Saddam's tyranny--all of these mistakes 
derive from our failure to think about what would happen in Iraq the 
day after Saddam fell. It was a much more profound mistake than not 
sending enough troops; we simply did not imagine that we would be 
facing problems that would require more troops.

Thinking of what was the most fundamental criticisms of our failures 
to anticipate the terror of September 11, I am reminded of the 9/11 
Commission's conclusion that we did not have the imagination to prepare 
for that attack.

In Iraq, where our imagination failed again, a thorough understanding 
of Iraqi history and society should have helped.

I am not talking about rehashing the history of imperialists, who 
would argue to justify their creation of the unnatural state of Iraq, 
or who would argue about the superiority of one sect over the other.

I am not talking about the history as told by anthropologists, who 
argue about ancient fights and long-simmering disputes.

A thorough study and understanding of Iraq would have required us--
and the top policymakers of this administration--to understand the 
complexity of Iraqi society as it was in 2003. And if we had done so, 
we would have had the imagination to prepare for the many contingencies 
that quite naturally developed when we so boldly sought to change the 
status quo.

We know that we had next to no intelligence on Iraq--and if you have 
read the latest NIE on Iraq put out last Friday, you will be dismayed, 
as I am, to read that we have very little more intelligence today.

But how about open source knowledge on which we could have made more 
careful assessments of what to expect the day after the tyrant toppled?

It was a tragic mistake to underestimate the role of criminality 
underpinning Saddam's regime in its last decrepit days, a criminality 
that was unleashed immediately after we invaded and which has added 
great complexity to the conflict among the many armed groups in Iraq 
today.

But we should not have underestimated the reluctance with which the 
Sunnis would accept their new de-classed position in Iraq.

We should not have overestimated the ability of the Shia, with no 
political experience, to assume political power. Had we properly 
assumed the difficulties that we would have faced, we should have been 
prepared for a period of instability, during which the neighbor to the 
east, Iran, would not sit idle.

I say this because I cannot support the administration today without 
honestly assessing what happened in the preparation and implementation 
of this war over 4 years ago.

And now, 4 years later, the Senate has determined to take up an 
increasingly partisan debate over what to do to prevent losing the Iraq 
war.

And we are now debating a variety of what I hope will be non-binding 
resolutions in response to the President's announcement to surge 21,500 
troops into the Iraq conflict.

This is an extremely somber moment in the history of this nation. We 
find ourselves in the midst of a war that it appears some still do not 
fully understand. It is a war whose dynamics and politics are 
completely in flux, and with the consequences of both our actions in 
the field--as well as in our politics right here--being profound for 
the Iraqi people, the Middle East region and our national security.

Make no mistake: What we do communicate is America's political will, 
and our political will is directly related to the morale of our troops. 
Those who seek to, for rhetorical purposes only, assert their support 
of the troops while communicating their opposition to their mission 
cannot sever this natural connection between political will and morale.

While it is always good for the Senate to debate great matters of war 
and peace--and, indeed, there are no more important matters--the 
imbalance between partisan rhetoric and substantive direction on this 
question has been, to my mind, unsettling. A perilous state of war in 
Iraq is not improved by the partisan level of debate here.

I have watched the course of this conflict with increasing concern 
and dismay.

As I said, I have been profoundly disappointed in realizing the 
errors we have made in implementing this war.

I have been greatly dismayed in the failure of the Iraqi people to 
resist the descent into sectarian violence, and their failure to demand 
leadership from their elected leaders.

I have been horrified by the level of barbarism. I have not been 
surprised, I must say, by the Sunni jihadists, whose barbarism should 
be well known by now, but by Shia militias, who, operating under a 
government dominated by the Iraqi Shia for the first time in modern 
Iraq's history, seem to operate without restraint or morality by their 
authorities in their nihilistic persecution of their real and perceived 
enemies. I can understand the sense of revenge one must feel when one 
has been


released from decades of oppression; I can understand the anger and 
despair one feels when one's family is targeted for murder; I can 
appreciate the rage when one's shrines and mosques are bombed. I will 
never understand a revenge that takes as its victims other innocents 
and noncombatants.

The American people have been shocked by this level of brutality as 
well--but we shouldn't call it mindless, because in the diabolic minds 
of the Sunni al-Qaida and ex-Baathist perpetrators, it has a reason: to 
push Iraq into chaos. In the minds of the bloody Shia militia leaders 
like Moqtada al-Sadr, there is also a rationale: Their militias 
complete the cyclical logic of barbarism.

In this cycle is perpetuated a nihilistic violence that will so 
destabilize Iraq that the Sunni jihadists will be able to create a 
safehaven where they will expand their reach and refocus on their long-
term goals. They are succeeding, and if they succeed they will focus on 
us.

In this cycle is perpetuated a nihilistic violence that will so 
destabilize Iraq that the Shia will be left so victimized and subject 
to militia rule that Iran will further assert its influence to 
undermine this fledgling nation. If post-Saddam Iraq succeeds, its 
success would provide the Shia world with an alternate model to the 
corrupt and failing regime in Tehran. If it fails, Tehran will have a 
field in which to meddle for years.


The Iraqi Shia, so traumatized by years of oppression under Saddam, 
and traumatized--let us be perfectly honest about this--by America 
misleading them and neglecting them in their hour of need immediately 
after the first gulf war--have failed to stand up and present political 
figures who can assert leadership instead of political impotence.

Iran is not a passive player here, no.

It is not in Iran's interest for the Iraqi Shia to build a strong, 
independent, Shia Arab state.

It is not in Iran's interest to have the seminaries of Najaf and 
Karbala returned to their central position in the world of Shia 
scholarship, possibly eclipsing Qum. To have this occur would lessen 
the legitimacy Iran desperately needs as ideological cover for Persian 
supremacy. The Iraqi Shia, Arabs who were the rank-and-file cannon 
fodder in the 8-year war against Iran, are now left open to Iran's 
meddling by their own weak government.

The Sunnis, Iraqi and others throughout the region, are quick to tell 
us we have fallen into a preexisting and ancient conflict between the 
Arabs and the Persians, and the Iraqi Shia and their seemingly hapless 
leaders are caught in between. And that is where we find ourselves 
today.

Now the Senate is to respond to the policy advanced by the President 
before the Nation on January 10.

We are to express approval or disapproval to the President's 
initiative in the middle of a war like this Nation has never faced. At 
a moment when the situation in Iraq is critical and the outcome is 
uncertain, some believe our excercise here will provide valuable 
clarity.

As I have said, it is fitting that the Senate debate this war.

From the day we passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to 
remove Saddam Hussein the fall of 2002, it has been fitting to debate 
this war, and we have, through many floor speeches and amendments to 
authorizing or appropriating legislation. Whether it is fitting that we 
respond to the President's latest change in military strategy with 
these resolutions is another matter.

I have paid a great deal of attention to the hearings held before the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. I thank and commend the chairmen and ranking minority 
members of both committees for the many opportunities for substantive 
review they have sought to present to us and to the American public.

Dozens of substantive testimonies have been submitted, and the 
questioning has been, in many cases, direct and detailed.

As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have 
also had the opportunity to listen to the opinions of the leaders of 
the intelligence community, and I have read the reports coming from 
Iraq including, most recently, the National Intelligence Estimate 
released last Friday.

The public needs to be reminded: There are no silver bullets, no 
glowing assessments, no confident predictions.

Surrounding this debate, there is a level of political taunting 
amongst ourselves that I find troubling.

From the majority leader, I hear public pronouncements of 21 
Republican seats to be defended in 2008--and I find it disturbing that 
anyone would question that a Senator of any party would hinge his or 
her voice on such momentous policy problems for the purpose of personal 
political survival.

Does anyone doubt that the November election in 2008 is a world away 
from the carnage of Iraq today?

Can anyone predict with certainty what the situation will be in Iraq 
almost 2 years from now?

I do not like the rhetoric of ''cut and run'' any more than I like 
the rhetoric accusing members of my party for ''heading for the tall 
grass.''

Lives are in balance and we should not be throwing around glib 
rhetoric.

In that sense, the exclamation of a member of my party 2 weeks ago 
that we should all be accountable on these resolutions or go be shoe 
salesmen has a certain urgency, although I do not condescend to the 
working man, a good many of whom are fighting in this war as we speak.

Nor do I believe that if I go and buy a pair of shoes from a good 
shoe salesman today that those shoes will not last longer and give 
better value than some of the resolutions being bandied about today, to 
be forgotten months from now when the war will bring to us either the 
reality of some progress toward stability, more stalemate in strife or 
even greater chaos.

One should predict the future with caution and humility. But, I can 
make one prediction here, particularly to those on the other side of 
the aisle: Iraq will be a central issue before this Congress, and 
before the next administration, in 2009.

We cannot make it go away before then. There is no way that a 
withdrawal begun now will leave a new administration free from the 
policy problems presented by Iraq.

So we should liberate ourselves right now from seeking partisan 
advantage, because as much as some may wish to walk away from Iraq, its 
relevance to our security and standing is not going to diminish. Not 
for a long time.

I will support the President's plan for this surge, and I will 
support any resolution that articulates such support, provided I can 
agree with all of its language. In doing so, I am acutely aware that 
the situation we are addressing is at least in some part a function of 
policy failures committed by this administration.

Admitting this, I have to say that I am unaware, through my reading 
of American military and diplomatic history, of any conflict in the 
midst of which our leaders saw clearly the end. Rarely have outcomes 
been perceivable through the shifting tactics and circumstances that 
war presented in the moment of greatest chaos.

Many times, in hot wars and cold wars, we have reassessed and changed 
policy.

Retroactive analysis and accountability are important--sometimes it 
is critical to understand minor and major mistakes in order to correct 
flawed policy--but the challenge is to seek the policy amongst the 
realistic options that will best deliver us to our goals for the 
future, not to sink in self-satisfying denunciations of the past.

I have read each of these resolutions carefully. I oppose the 
original Biden amendment, because I fundamentally disagree with it.

Its first resolution clause states:




 It is not in the national interest of the U.S. to deepen 


 its military involvement in Iraq, particularly by escalating 


 the United States military force presence in Iraq.


I deeply disagree.

Not only does this set up a potential constitutional conflict between 
the executive and legislature as to who runs foreign policy in a war, 
its intent is to inhibit the President from trying to improve the 
situation in Iraq at a perilous time. Further, to maintain the status 
quo in Iraq, as this clause implies, is to guarantee greater chaos in 
Iraq.

If the opponents of the President want to force a withdrawal, 
shouldn't they say so directly?

The second clause of the original Biden resolution stated:







 The primary objective of U.S. strategy in Iraq should be to 


 have the Iraqi political leaders make the political 


 compromises necessary to end the violence in Iraq.


When I read this, I have to ask, where have the authors of this 
language been? That was our strategy, which we tried mightily, from 
2004 until last year: to let politics lead the way to security. But the 
forces of insurgency and chaos overwhelmed the fledgling political 
process and now we clearly realize we have to implement and achieve 
security before we can regain political process.

Am I the only one here who finds it ironic that critics of the 
administration who support this resolution appear to be advocating a 
policy that has failed?


The next clause reads:




 Greater concerted regional and international support would 


 assist the Iraqis in achieving a political and national 


 reconciliation.


This is not a policy option, but a dreamer's delusion. It is true, in 
the abstract, that international support would be greatly beneficial to 
the Iraqis. But if you look at the region, this dream of international 
cooperation is not based on reality. Aspirations should not substitute 
for harsh reality.

Then the resolution states:




 Main elements of the mission of the U.S. forces in Iraq 


 should transition to helping ensure the territorial integrity 


 of Iraq, conduct counterterrorism activities, reduce regional 


 interference in the internal affairs of Iraq, and accelerate 


 training of Iraqi troops.


But, we are conducting counterterrorist activities, and the fight in 
al-Anbar for which the President has requested a small number of this 
surge is exactly for that. But this resolution disapproves of that, if 
you are to re-read the first clause. We are accelerating training, but 
we have learned that, if you are going to do it right, you can't speed 
it up beyond a certain point.

To paraphrase my colleague, the vice chairman of the Intelligence 
Committee, Senator Bond, who has said of rushed intelligence 
assessments:




 If you want it bad, you're going to get it . . . bad.


If we rush the training, as we have seen, we're going to get 
ineffective results. If our training of the Iraqi security forces is to 
be effective and successful, we need to take the time to do it right.

I am all for reducing regional interference, but to do so might mean 
exercising power and influence, and critics of this President have a 
conniption if you suggest anything other than a diplomatic tea party 
with Syria or Iran.

And I do not consider it wise to commit to the territorial integrity 
of Iraq. We should be agnostic about this question, and recent history 
should keep us humble against knee-jerk commitments to territorial 
lines drawn by imperial powers. A previous Bush administration fumbled 
on the wrong side of history in the last days of the Cold War when it 
argued against ''suicidal nationalism'' at a time when the Soviet Union 
was dissolving. A failure to recognize that Yugoslavia was a false 
state led the U.S. to delay for years an involvement that could have 
saved hundreds of thousands of civilian lives.

If a soft partition could be achieved without bloodshed, I would 
support that in Iraq, although no one has figured out how to do that, 
yet, and it remains unclear whether Iraqis themselves, particularly 
urbanized Iraqis, desire this or could survive a bloody partition.

But I repeat: If I could imagine a nonviolent partition implemented 
by an international organization that would have the support of the 
Iraqi people, I would rather find the billions to do that than the 
billions to fight a war. In the case of finding financial resources for 
soft partition, I would expect we would have a somewhat better response 
from the international community than we are having now.

The next resolution clause states:




 The U.S. should transfer, under an appropriately expedited 


 timeline, responsibility for internal security and halting 


 sectarian violence in Iraq to the Government of Iraq and 


 Iraqi security forces.


But just because we want to shed ourselves of this war does not mean 
we can immediately stand up Iraqi security forces. We have been trying 
to do that, and it is taking time. This clause is, in effect, purely 
aspirational. It makes us feel good, but it doesn't change the reality 
on the ground.

The final clause states:




 The U.S. should engage nations in the Middle East to 


 develop a regional, internationally-sponsored peace and 


 reconciliation process for Iraq.


Mr. President, who are the players in the Middle East who are both: 
(a) sympathetic to the Iraqi cause, and (b) strong enough to be 
effective?

No country meets both of these simple conditions.

They aren't there. It is too typical of the critics of this 
administration to substitute the process of diplomacy for the substance 
of hard policy choices.

Now, I do not oppose diplomacy. It is a legitimate tool in the tool 
kit. But diplomacy must always be part of a broader policy. Before I 
would support this administration's diplomatic initiative toward Iran, 
I would want to see a comprehensive Iran policy. However late in the 
day, the administration appears to to be forming such a policy, and it 
appears to include elements of confrontation and competition, as well 
as a clearly stated solicitation for more constructive relations, as 
any sound and sophisticated policy should.

If we are to sit down with Iran while Iran is continuing with a 
program for nuclear development, continues to be the No. 1 state 
sponsor of terrorism in the world, continues to undermine the stability 
in Lebanon, and is working against the coalition's forces in Iraq, I 
would want those Iranian diplomats that we are sipping tea with to know 
that we are competing and challenging them on all of those fronts. It 
would be foolish to talk to Iran simply hoping we could convince the 
Iranians to see the world our way.

The nations of the region with whom we are close do support the peace 
and reconciliation in Iraq. And those nations want us to remain in Iraq 
until the situation is stabilized. Kuwait, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi 
Arabia--none of those governments want us to leave Iraq the way it is 
now. But Syria and Iran and al-Qaida, too--they want us to leave, and 
leave behind chaos they can exploit.

My colleague and good friend, Senator Warner, has made an effort to 
write a resolution that smoothed away some of the aspects of the 
original Biden legislation which I find I cannot support.

In particular, the senior Senator from Virginia recognizes, in the 
first clause, the President's foreign policy prerogative, while 
somewhat ambiguously also stating that the resolution's intent is not 
''to question or contravene'' the President's constitutional authority 
as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States.

I say ''ambiguously,'' because Senator Warner's first resolution 
clause is remarkably similar to Senator Biden's:




 The Senate disagrees with the plan to augment our forces 


 and urges the President to consider all options and 


 alternatives for achieving the strategic goals set forth 


 below.


It seems to me, however, that adding troops to meet the goals the 
President has set--achieving a zone of security in Baghdad from which 
the Iraqi political leadership can assert its leadership and implement 
essential policies--is a major option that the Warner resolution 
precludes.

Further, Senator Warner's resolution strongly supports our efforts 
against Sunni jihadists, including al-Qaida, in Anbar Province, as I 
do.

Senator Warner and the cosponsors of his resolution, however, do not 
want to see us in between the various sects fighting in Baghdad.

I have to ask: If we are to encourage the anti-al-Qaida Sunni 
elements in Anbar to join us in a fight to eradicate al-Qaida, what 
credibility do we have to do so if we are standing by while Sunni 
jihadists target Shia in Baghdad, and Shia militias slaughter Sunnis in 
response?

Part of how we got here is by not imagining the way the perpetrators 
of sectarian strife calculate. We can't continue to fail to understand 
this dynamic, nor to believe that we can ignore it.

I will support the President's surge strategy because I believe there 
is a reasonable chance--reasonable, not guaranteed--that a strong 
military presence that has open rules of engagement to attack 
insurgents, militias and other criminal elements may create a zone of 
calm and security for Baghdad. This goal is to create the


space for political leaders to make effective decisions on oil 
resources, federalism, economic development and other critical issues 
to entice the majority of the Iraqis into believing there is an 
alternative to civil war.

Such a period of calm, if achieved, is essential not only for the 
political system to assert itself, but for us to complete the majority 
of our training of Iraqi security forces.

If we are to succeed, we won't be able to do it alone. The Iraqi 
Sunnis are going to have to lead in defeating the foreigners who are 
terrorizing them in their homes in western Iraq and leading the attacks 
against Shia in Baghdad.

The Sunnis will have to lead in ejecting al-Qaida, as they have begun 
to do so.

The Sunnis, not the Shia, are going to have to definitively expose 
and defeat the former Baathists who have not accepted that the Baath 
era is over.

The Sunni will have to address this challenge, not the Shia.

And the Shia, not the Sunni, are going to have to lead in ending the 
terror of the Shia militias.

The Shia are going to have to defeat those who claim to advance the 
Shia cause by revenge, by torture, by barbarism. If the Maliki 
government fails to muster the political will to do so, we cannot 
impose it from the outside.

Perhaps the Iraqi government can finally make progress toward 
building institutions that will sustain a unified Iraq, toward passing 
legislation that will divide Iraq's enormous natural resources 
equitably among the three ethnicities, that will open the civil society 
to Sunnis, instead of punishing them indiscriminately for their 
dominance during the Baath era.

Perhaps.

But if not, this Nation and this administration should not be 
irrationally wedded to the notion of a unitary state of Iraq. We need 
to imagine all options, rather than cling to ideas which may have 
departed from the realm of reasonable options.

I will support this surge because the option right now of withdrawing 
leaves three critical questions unanswered:

No. 1: How do we continue the fight against foreign Sunni extremists, 
including al-Qaida, in the west of Iraq?

No. 2: Are we to leave a fractured Shia substate unstable enough for 
Iran to exert expansionist influence, thereby strengthening Tehran?

No. 3: Are we prepared as a nation to see a bloodbath ensue, in 
Baghdad and elsewhere, that may make other American foreign policy 
failures--Budapest in 1956, Vietnam in 1975, the Shia slaughter after 
we ejected Saddam from Kuwait in 1991--pale in comparison?

As I said at the beginning of this speech, the critics' attempts to 
set the stage for withdrawal commits the same strategic blunder they 
legitimately accuse the Bush administration of making in its 
implementation of the Iraq war. They didn't think of the day after 
Saddam fell. Today the critics are not thinking of the day after we 
withdraw.

Today, however, we need to recognize that worse than the vanity about 
easy victory committed in 2003 is the denial of calamitous defeat that 
would occur if we leave before we make every attempt to stabilize the 
country.

For this reason, I will support the administration, but I will do so 
under no casual assumptions or glib assurances.

I will also do so by demanding that the administration be much more 
forthcoming in its plans for the day after--the day after we complete 
our surge into Baghdad, the day after we can honestly assess that 
Baghdad has been pacified, and heaven forbid, the day after we assess 
that the chaos unleashed and manipulated by the forces of destruction 
are prohibiting a meaningful and comprehensive success.

I am not conceding defeat, nor preparing for withdrawal.

I am supporting a strategy for success. So far, President Bush--who 
has a lot to answer for the mistakes that have been made--is offering 
the only way to try to leave Iraq in better shape than it is now.

He has my support, and I urge my colleagues to join me.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
