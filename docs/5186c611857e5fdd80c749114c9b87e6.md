Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. That is a very important and valid 
point.

I want to read a quote, and that quote is this: ''So let's get 
something straight right now. To point out that our military has been 
overextended, taken for granted and neglected, that is no criticism of 
the military, that is a criticism of the President and Vice President 
and their record of neglect.''

Who do you think said that? I will tell you who said that, George W. 
Bush, as a candidate, said that on November 3, 2000, in an interview on 
CNN.

I think it is pretty clear that he was right almost 7 years ago, and 
it is just sad that he didn't mean it. It is sad that he didn't 
actually do anything more than say those words instead of taking to 
heart what he supposedly believed at the time and making sure that it 
didn't happen when he became President.

Clearly Walter Reed, the lack of body armor and preparation and 
training that we are sending, that we have been sending and he was 
willing to send our troops over to Iraq and Afghanistan without, is 
clearly still something that he is willing to do. Unfortunately, all 
the President has been is a candidate who spews words with really not 
too much meaning behind them. It looks like Mr. Altmire would like to 
say something.
