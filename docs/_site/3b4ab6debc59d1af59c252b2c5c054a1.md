Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, despite my belief in the 
inadequacies of the President's new strategy, to vote for the 
resolution with the troops already deployed is a step I cannot take. I 
am unwilling to--after the fact--say to them, I oppose your mission.

My vote should not be interpreted as approval of the administration's 
conduct of this war. I have had the opportunity to meet General David 
Petraeus, the new commander of the U.S. forces in Iraq. I believe he is 
one of the most capable military commanders America has available for 
this mission. General Petraeus has indicated there is a chance for 
success and that he will report to the American people in 6 months as 
to whether or not the President's plan is working.

Let us give the new leaders and the new strategy this short period of 
time to see if stability can be achieved--an investment necessary to 
ensure the lives lost and families damaged thus far have not sacrificed 
in vain.
