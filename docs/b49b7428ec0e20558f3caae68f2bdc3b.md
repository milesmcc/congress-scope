Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I go back to the basics, and that is, read 
the amendment before you. This amendment asks that the Secretaries 
jointly establish and operate a temporary program to offer employment 
as translators, interpreters, et cetera. This is not a mandate in the 
words at all that are before us. Under this amendment, these Iraqis 
must have assisted our country in Iraq for at least a year and be here 
in the United States legally.

As a practical matter, these are the Iraqis who have been brought to 
our country under the legislation offered by my good friend Duncan 
Hunter that was included in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2 
years ago, which is good language. We are also not talking about a 
large number of people. We are talking about 760 people who have been 
brought to the United States.

I think we can do something for them. I think a careful reading of 
the amendment will solve a lot of discussion today. Mr. Israel is 
right.
