# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS

`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 1 May 2007`

---


Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to encourage 
President Bush to go ahead and veto the supplemental appropriations 
bill that Congress has sent him this afternoon because of the language 
in that bill on Iraq that I consider to be bad for our troops and 
dangerous for our country.

The legislation that Congress has passed, in my opinion, represents 
the worst of all worlds. As I have said before, if people feel the war 
in Iraq is lost, or if people feel it is not lost but not worth 
fighting for, then what they ought to do is act to end the war. This 
legislation would do no such thing. It would not end the war in Iraq. 
It will not require the withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq. It 
will not cut off funding for the war in Iraq.

On the contrary, what this legislation proposes to do is something 
far worse. It would handcuff our soldiers with an inflexible and 
arbitrary set of restrictions--restrictions that would take life-and-
death decisions about how, when, and where our troops can fight away 
from those troops and their commanders. It would substitute the 
judgment of politicians in Washington for the judgment of our military 
commanders on the ground. That is wrong.

What is more, this legislation will impose on our soldiers in Iraq a 
binding deadline of October 1, 2007--5 months from today--to begin 
withdrawal. That withdrawal would be required to begin regardless of 
conditions on the ground, regardless of the recommendations of our 
military leaders, regardless of the opinions of our allies in the 
region--in short, regardless of reality--on October 1, 2007.

This is a deadline as arbitrary as it is inflexible. It is a deadline 
for defeat--defeat for America and a defeat for the hopes of the 
majority of the Iraqi people for a better, freer future.

I know we have heard from some supporters of this legislation that by 
ordering a withdrawal we will encourage the Iraqis to make political 
compromises. Where is the evidence of this?

According to the legislation this Congress has now sent to the 
President, the withdrawal must begin regardless of what the Iraqi 
Government does. Where, then, is the incentive for the Iraqis to 
reconcile? On the contrary, there is every reason to conclude this 
legislation will have exactly the opposite effect that its sponsors 
claim for it.

Listen to the latest National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, which 
has been saluted by Members of this Chamber on both sides of the 
question of what to do now in Iraq. That latest National Intelligence 
Estimate predicted that a withdrawal of American troops in the months 
ahead would ''almost certainly lead to a significant increase in the 
scale and scope of sectarian violence, intensify Sunni resistance, and 
have adverse effects on national reconciliation.''

How do the supporters of this legislation explain that National 
Intelligence Estimate? For that matter, how do they justify this 
legislation, in light of what we all heard directly from GEN David 
Petraeus, the commander of our forces in Iraq, when we spoke with him 
and he spoke with us last week?

General Petraeus told us very clearly that we have achieved progress 
since our new strategy in Iraq--the so-called surge--began. Consider 
the situation in Anbar Province to the West of Baghdad, which has 
dramatically improved. That has been documented not by representatives 
of the administration or people who support the current policy but on 
the front pages of the New York Times and USA Today in the last few 
days.

At a moment when Sunnis in Anbar are finally helping us in targeting 
al-Qaida terrorists, this legislation would require us to abandon them.

Madam President, what message are we sending to our friends and our 
foes with this ill-advised legislation? We have heard from some that we 
need to abandon Iraq because it is not part of the war on terror. But 
here again, listen to General Petraeus, who is on the ground, one of 
the most outstanding generals of our military that I have met since I 
have been a Senator, confirmed unanimously by the Senate a short while 
ago. Here is what General Petraeus warned us:




 Iraq is, in fact, the central front of al-Qaida's global 


 campaign against us.


Let me repeat that. General Petraeus said:




 Iraq is, in fact, the central front of al-Qaida's global 


 campaign against us.


If we withdraw, as this legislation would require us to begin to do, 
al-Qaida wins--the same al-Qaida that attacked America on September 11, 
2001, killing 3,000 innocents, the same al-Qaida that intends to attack 
us again, the same al-Qaida that has made very clear to us what its 
plans for domination and control of large sectors of the world are.

Madam President, the violence we are seeing in Iraq today, the 
suicide bombings in Baghdad, the chemical weapons attacks in Anbar 
Province, the targeted assassinations of Iraq's leaders--these are all 
primarily the work of al-Qaida. So the big question, then, for me--and 
I ask my colleagues to consider it--is whether we respond to al-Qaida's 
terrorism by pulling out, as it hopes we do, and as this legislation 
would require us to do--abandoning the future of Iraq, the Middle East, 
and ultimately our own American security, to the very people 
responsible for the terrible atrocities and suicide bombings we see in 
Iraq today.

The alternative to pulling out is standing up and fighting. That is 
what we are doing now in Iraq and doing with some success in Baghdad 
and Anbar Province. Rather than undermining General Petraeus and 
handing al-Qaida a victory, Congress should take swift and responsible 
action to get General Petraeus and our troops in the field the support 
they need to prevail.

The Iraq war is not lost. But if this supplemental became law, it 
would be lost and America would suffer the consequences of that defeat 
for generations.

President Bush, veto this bill.

I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
