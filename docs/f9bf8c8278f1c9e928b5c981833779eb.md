Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Army Sergeant Matthew 
Hennigan, a resident of southern Nevada who was killed in action 
serving in Afghanistan.

Sergeant Hennigan was a strong willed and brave soldier who never 
shied away from a challenge or turned down an opportunity to serve. 
With a contagious smile and a warm personality, Sergeant Hennigan was a 
strong and fearless soldier and a friend to many. He is remembered by 
his fellow soldiers as a model citizen, a strong warrior, and a 
respected leader.

He was an inspirational captain of the Silverado High School 
wrestling team in his senior year; and upon graduation, he answered the 
call to serve his Nation at the young age of 17. He did so with valor 
and dignity.

Matthew Hennigan is a true American hero. He epitomizes the best this 
country has to offer. Let us always honor his memory, never forget his 
sacrifice, and promise to be there for his family in this sad time.

God bless our troops.
