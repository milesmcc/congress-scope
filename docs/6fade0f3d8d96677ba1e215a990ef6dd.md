# CUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUDGET

`Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts â€” 9 December 2008`

---


Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, in a thoughtful and well 
documented article in the Boston Globe for December 3, Joseph 
Cirincione makes a very persuasive case for putting significant 
reductions in our nuclear weapons budget at the head of the list of 
budget savings President-elect Obama intends to make. Mr. Cirincione is 
the president of Ploughshares, and some of us remember the good work he 
did as a staff member working on trying to fashion a sensible nuclear 
weapons policy years ago in the House. He speaks with a great deal of 
knowledge and I am very pleased that someone as responsible and well 
informed as Mr. Cirincione has come forward to make this case. As he 
says in his article, the President ''can cut obsolete programs and 
transfer tens of billions of dollars per year to pressing conventional 
military and domestic programs.''

Madam Speaker, no rational solution to the problem of an ever-
increasing budget deficit can be imagined that does not include 
significant reductions in the rate of military spending. Joseph 
Cirincione demonstrates how this can be done in a way that does no 
damage whatsoever to our national security and I ask that the article 
be printed here.

 Need Cash? Cut Nuclear Weapons Budget













 (By Joseph Cirincione)




 President-Elect Barack Obama needs money, ''To make the 


 investments we need,'' he said last week, ''we'll have to 


 scour our federal budget, line by line, and make meaningful 


 cuts and sacrifices, as well.''



 There is no better place to start than the nuclear weapons 


 budget. He can cut obsolete programs and transfer tens of 


 billions of dollars per year to pressing conventional 


 military and domestic programs.



 Transfers to domestic programs will help jumpstart the 


 economy. Military spending provides some economic stimulus 


 but not as much as targeted domestic spending. This is one 


 reason Representative Barney Frank has called for a 25 


 percent reduction in military budgets that have exploded 


 from. 305 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $716 billion in 


 fiscal year 2009, including the $12 billion spent every month 


 for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.



 We must, of course, spend what we need to defend the 


 country. But a good part of the military budget is still 


 devoted to programs designed for the Cold War, which ended 


 almost 20 years ago. This is particularly true of the $31 


 billion spent each year to maintain and secure a nuclear 


 arsenal of almost 5,400 nuclear weapons, with 1,500 still 


 deployed on missiles ready to launch within 15 minutes.



 We can safely reduce to 1,000 total weapons, as recommended 


 by Senator John Kerry and other nuclear experts. That 


 reduction would save over $20 billion a year, according to 


 the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.



 The reductions could be done without any sacrifice to US 


 national security, particularly if the Russians did the same 


 (as they indicated they'd be willing to do) either by a 


 negotiated treaty or the kind of unilateral reductions 


 executed by former presidents George H.W. Bush and Mikhail 


 Gorbachev in 1991.



 The arsenal of 1,000 warheads could be deployed on 10 safe 


 and secure Trident submarines, each with enough weapons to 


 devastate any nation. In total, the smaller, cheaper arsenal 


 would still be sufficient to destroy the world several times 


 over. Further reductions would generate further savings over 


 time.



 Additional savings are available in the related anti-


 missile programs created during the Bush administration. 


 Total spending is now $13 billion a year--up from $4 billion 


 in 2000. Bush and former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld 


 exempted the agency from the normal checks of Pentagon tests 


 and procurement rules in an effort to institutionalize the 


 program, locking in the next president, Obama will inherit 


 half-built facilities in Alaska and California, along with 


 plans to build new sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, 


 but no assurance that the interceptors actually work--and a 


 huge bill to pay. If Obama were to continue the program as 


 is, he would spend an estimated $62 billion through 2012.



 In a congressional review of these programs, Representative 


 John Tierney of Massachusetts concluded, ''Since the 1980s, 


 taxpayers have already spent $120 to $150 billion--more time 


 and more money than we spent on the Manhattan project or the 


 Apollo program, with no end in sight.'' Tierney recommends 


 refocusing the program to concentrate on defenses against the 


 short-range weapons Iran and other nations currently field, 


 and restoring realistic testing and realistic budgeting. 


 Doing so could save $6 billion or more a year.



 Further savings can be found by stopping a planned 


 expansion of nuclear weapons production facilities pushed by 


 contractors and some government nuclear laboratories. The 


 facilities would cost tens of billions of dollars and produce 


 hundreds of new nuclear warheads. Secretary of Defense Robert 


 Gates strongly backs the expansion. In a direct challenge to 


 Obama's plans to reduce nuclear weapons and ratify the 


 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Gates said in October, ''there 


 is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible deterrent and 


 reduce the number of weapons in our stockpile without either 


 resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing a 


 modernization program.'' Obama will have to back him down or 


 pony up billions to pay Gate's nuclear tab.



 What will the new president do? He comes to office with a 


 comprehensive nuclear policy that could save billions. Obama 


 will now have to show that this new security team will 


 implement the change he promised, not their own parochial 


 agendas.
