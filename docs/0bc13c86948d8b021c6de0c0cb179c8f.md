Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from 
Mississippi, let me point out the fact that both in the House version 
of the defense authorization bill as well as the Senate version of the 
bill there is positive reference to the threat of a failed state in 
Iraq. That is fully recognized in both pieces of legislation, and I 
appreciate the gentleman's comments thereon and hopefully correct and 
parallel language could be adopted in that regard.

I now, Madam Speaker, yield 5 minutes to my friend, my colleague, the 
gentleman from Mississippi, the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Seapower (Mr. Taylor).
