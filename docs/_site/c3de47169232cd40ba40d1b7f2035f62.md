Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady.

When parts of Texas endure an extreme drought, the burden is felt 
most heavily by our farm families. A devastating lack of water left 
many of our counties parched. Sam Berry, a rancher from Lavaca County 
wrote me to say: ''After back-to-back bad seasons and with all my 
reserve hay gone, how much worse could it get''?

Well, as bad as that drought was down in Texas, it is nothing like 
the drought of understanding for the plight of farmers and ranchers 
here in Washington. They have faced indifference on top of 
indifference.

Federal disaster assistance dried up. I received similar pleas from 
farmers and ranchers like David Wagner in Lavaca County and others from 
Bastrop County and Caldwell County and Fayette and Colorado counties. 
The last Congress, with $10 billion to burn every month in Iraq, had 
nothing to offer these ranchers here at home. When our new Congress 
finally passed emergency help this March, that help was vetoed by the 
President.

The bill that we pass today is another attempt to provide much-needed 
assistance to these farmers and ranchers.

I know that ranching looks mighty easy over in the Oval Office when 
some over there seem to think that clearing out brush in August is 
vacation work. But for those for whom ranching is not a hobby, who have 
found that their fields turned fallow; for those like Pat Peterson of 
Red Rock whom high-priced hay means selling their best livestock, 
disaster endangers a life and a livelihood.

This spring, Texas has had some relief. But who is to say this wet 
spring will last, and it is not enough to make up for the last two 
really bad seasons that our farmers and ranchers have endured. Helping 
our farmers and ranchers now cannot guarantee them success, but it will 
go a long way in helping restore what has been lost and protect what 
remains.

I hope the House tonight will approve this bill and that the 
President will finally get behind the relief that his fellow Texans 
need so very much.
