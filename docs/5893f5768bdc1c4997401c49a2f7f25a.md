Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to be able to 
rise today to celebrate two important statements that were made on the 
floor of the House today. I might alter that and say ''celebrate'' but 
also to acknowledge and commemorate.

I do want to associate myself with the legislation of Congresswoman 
Susan Davis of California in acknowledging the women in the United 
States military. Women have shown themselves in Iraq and Afghanistan 
and all around the world to be true leaders. Many have been injured, 
many of them have seen serious injuries. They have been mothers, they 
have been sisters and daughters. They have led their families, but yet 
they have been warriors and battlers for the freedom of America. I 
salute them and celebrate them as we commemorate Memorial Day.

Let me also join Mr. Wu in offering my deepest sympathy to the people 
of China for this tragic earthquake and the loss of now some thousands 
upon thousands of individuals. We extend our hand not only of 
friendship but of support and charity, and I look forward to working 
with the Counsulate General in Houston to be able to provide support 
for those families here in the United States as well as those who are 
suffering in China.

Our deepest prayers and deepest sympathy for those who mourn the loss 
of their loved ones.
