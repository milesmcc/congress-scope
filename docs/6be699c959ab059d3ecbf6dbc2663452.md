# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `6be699c959ab059d3ecbf6dbc2663452`
`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. KUCINICH. I yield myself 1 minute.

The more troops we send into Afghanistan, the more support the 
Taliban gains as resistors of foreign occupation. We say we want to 
negotiate with the Taliban in the future while, at the same time, 
conducting air strikes to take out Taliban strongholds across the 
country.

Just yesterday, The Washington Post published an article about the 
Zabul province and the pouring in of Taliban fighters following a 
retreat of U.S. Armed Forces from Zabul in December. If we accept the 
premise that we can never leave Afghanistan until the Taliban is 
eradicated, we may be there for a very long time.

The justification for our continued military presence in Afghanistan 
is that the Taliban, in the past, has provided a safe haven for al 
Qaeda, or could do so in the future. General Petraeus has already 
admitted that al Qaeda has little or no presence in Afghanistan.

We have to careful about branding al Qaeda and the Taliban as a 
single terrorist movement. Al Qaeda is an international organization, 
and, yes, they are a threat to the United States. The Taliban is only a 
threat to us as long as we continue our military occupation of 
Afghanistan.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. Lee).
