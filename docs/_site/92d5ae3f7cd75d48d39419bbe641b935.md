Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California.

Mr. Speaker, we have an interesting bill before us here today. It 
appropriates $100 million for shrimp, it appropriates $100 million for 
citrus growers, it appropriates $74 million for a particular type of 
peanut storage and


$25 million for spinach. It even appropriates $50 million for a Capitol 
Hill power plant. And they do this in the name of funding the troops. I 
think this is, again, Washington hypocrisy at work.

The most egregious part of this bill, I find, is that there are 
billions of dollars in this bill for livestock, which the American 
people, Mr. Speaker, should know is literally pork for pork.

And it is all about getting votes together to fund the troops in 
harm's way, but instead of funding the troops in harm's way, they are 
funding pork-barrel projects here in the United States.

I believe, Mr. Speaker, this is wrong for our troops in battle, but 
it is a great gift for Washington Democrat politicians who are in power 
here in the House today.

This is a failure to understand what ''emergency'' means, what 
''war'' means and the fight we have going in Iraq.
