Mrs. DAVIS of California. I rise in support of the Skelton-Berman-
Lowey amendment.

Mr. Chairman, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted why 
Congress and the executive branch must do a better job of marshalling 
all elements of national power in support of U.S. goals abroad and 
ensure that future missions are not military-centric but joint 
interagency efforts.

The creation of an interagency advisory panel required to make 
recommendations to each department is an excellent first step.

As important as the creation of this new panel is, the coordination 
between the committees that we see here today is also critical.

We know that part of the interagency problem is the rigid stovepipe 
structure found right here in this body. So while this amendment seeks 
to influence the executive branch, it will take reforms on both ends of 
Pennsylvania Avenue to have the type of interagency coordination we 
need to address the challenges of the 21st century.

I applaud the sponsors of this bill, Chairman Skelton, Chairman 
Berman and Chairwoman Lowey. They deserve an enormous amount of credit 
for bringing this forward, and I urge all of my colleagues to support 
it.
