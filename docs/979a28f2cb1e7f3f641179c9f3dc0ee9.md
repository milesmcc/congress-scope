Mr. McHUGH. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Speaker, let me begin by admitting right up front, this is not 
a perfect approach, but it is by far the best approach that we have 
available to us. I want to echo the words of my friend who just spoke, 
the gentleman from New Jersey, and add my words of appreciation and 
deep compliments to the distinguished chairman of the full committee, 
Chairman Skelton, the distinguished ranking member, Chairman Hunter, 
the great staff on both sides, and all the members who have worked so 
very hard to bring this moment to reality.

Frankly, we are dealing with an issue that is a product of the 
challenge that did not begin in this House. It came through the general 
authorization process, a provision that started in the Senate, that, as 
we have heard here today, and I certainly endorse, we in concept all 
agree with. All of us believe that American citizens who have been 
aggrieved by any state sponsor of terrorism, including the previous 
Iraqi Government, deserve every possible means of redress available to 
them.

We believe that in the context of the challenge before us, this bill 
continues and preserves that right, and does it in a way that, most 
importantly, understands that the primary objective of this bill is 
bringing to those brave men and women in uniform who are serving so 
ably across this planet, particularly in theaters of conflict like Iraq 
and Afghanistan, the immediate added benefits that are derived from 
this piece of legislation.

The distinguished chairman could not be more correct in his 
observation that this is not just a good bill, it is bordering on a 
great bill. The pay increases, the increases in various benefits are 
something that we cannot put in jeopardy by choosing another course 
other than by voting for and feeling very positive about this piece of 
legislation.

Like all the speakers before, I join with them in hoping that each 
and every Member of this House will take advantage of this opportunity, 
rise to the challenge that has been presented to us, and vote ''aye,'' 
in the affirmative, for this legislation, and preserve the rights and 
lead a path toward justice that those aggrieved people of state 
sponsors of terrorism so richly deserve, and at the same time provide 
the wealth of benefits that are embodied in this great piece of 
legislation.
