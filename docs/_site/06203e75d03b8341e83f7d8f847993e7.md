`Mr. LARSON of Connecticut â€” 12 July 2007`

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Skelton for 
yielding me this time.

They buried Andre Craig, 24 years old, last week. He died in the 
service of his country. His family held a press conference prior to 
that and said, he was exhausted.

Mr. Skelton has put forward a piece of legislation, not a resolution, 
a bill that address the men and women in the armed services, that 
addresses the problems that they face on a daily basis in Iraq.

There is a difficult choice today to be made. Our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are honorable people. They understand as well 
exactly what it is


like to go to a funeral service, to look into the eyes of these 
families, many who have been deployed three and four times, who are 
stretched to the maximum. You know what they are experiencing. It is 
hard to reconcile, because we know you are honorable people, the 
indifference that seems to lie in the choice between the blind loyalty 
to the worst foreign policy endeavor in the history of the country and 
the men and women who are there paying for it every single day. You are 
right, emotions run deep.

How many more of these services will it take for us to face the truth 
and the facts? People have come to this floor and said, well, you know 
that the President is going to veto this. One thing we know for sure is 
where the President stands and what he has said he will do and how this 
will be passed on to another administration. But the thing here is what 
we will do, what you will do.

Find your voice. Speak on behalf of the troops. Follow Ike Skelton.
