Mr. LYNCH. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

As the co-Chair of the House Task Force on Terrorist Financing and 
Nonproliferation, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my distinguished 
colleague, Chairwoman Lowey.

I would like to confirm that the $57 million requested by President 
Obama for nonproliferation, antiterrorism, demining, and related 
programs in Afghanistan, will be fully funded.

Is it the chairwoman's intent that those critical security and 
humanitarian-related activities will be funded at the President's 
requested level?
