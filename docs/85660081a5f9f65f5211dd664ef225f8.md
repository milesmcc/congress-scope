`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 18 June 2007`

Mr. KUCINICH. If, in fact, that's what he said, then of course the 
U.N. should look into it. But I think we should look into whether or 
not he said that. And again, I offered to submit, but was denied a 
unanimous consent, the text of his speech, and a translation by Nazila 
Fathi in the New York Times Tehran Bureau of the speech. This is from 
the New York Times. And they certainly have never been accused of any 
kind of propaganda against Israel.

So I would say that it is important for us to look at this. And I 
don't think it is an unreasonable request that we should look at 
exactly what this person said so we will know what the appropriate 
course of action is to take.

I stand for peace. I stood before this Congress and challenged the 
war against Iraq when very few people were willing to do that because I 
questioned whether or not Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction. I 
am questioning whether or not this person is trying to destroy Israel. 
If he is, then I certainly support my friend's concerns.
