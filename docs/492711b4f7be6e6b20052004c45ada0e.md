Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill 
to finally end this disastrous war. President Bush's war in Iraq has 
been the biggest foreign policy catastrophe in our Nation's history. We 
have been distracted from doing the job in Afghanistan, the Nation that 
harbored al Qaeda. Hundreds of billions of dollars have evaporated into 
the sands of Iraq while vital needs have gone unmet at home. Our 
international reputation has been battered and bruised. Our Army has 
been hollowed out.

The war has cut short the lives of more than 3,600 of our bravest 
citizens, injured tens of thousands more. Yet this President continues 
to insist that we remain in Iraq.

Today we must tell this President he is wrong. We must take a stand 
against this tragic war, begin the hard work of repairing our foreign 
policy. We must listen to the American people and vote to end this war.

Let us truly support our troops and vote to bring them home.
