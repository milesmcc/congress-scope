Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my good friend, the 
senior ranking member of our House Foreign Affairs Committee, for her 
kind comments, mentioning also about the military participation of the 
sons and daughters of American Samoa.

According to the recent reports of USA Today newspaper, American 
Samoans have the highest percentage per annum in the whole United 
States in terms of those who sacrificed their lives in the war in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, with about 136 percent above all States and 
territories. I do want to thank the gentlelady for reminding us of 
that.

Mr. Speaker, if I could ask how much more time do we have?
