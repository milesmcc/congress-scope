Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, Iranians and Saudis are uniting to try 
to avoid a war in Lebanon while the U.S. stays on the sidelines. 
Meanwhile, the Bush administration is isolating our Nation from Europe 
and trying to force Europe to block Iranian exports and freeze assets.

The U.S. should be standing for peaceful resolution of conflict. 
Instead, the White House escalates conflict: escalates with Iran, 
escalates in Iraq, escalates violence, escalates deaths, and escalates 
the Federal deficit.

I want the Bush administration to know there will be constitutional 
consequences for the President and the Vice President if this 
administration continues to move towards war with Iran.
