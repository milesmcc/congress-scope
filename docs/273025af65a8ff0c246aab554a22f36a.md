# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `273025af65a8ff0c246aab554a22f36a`
`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I would suggest to the 
gentleman, while he believes this plan has no chance of working and it 
is the same as previous plans, the fact is the newly confirmed general 
in Iraq, General Petraeus, who is by all accounts the most significant 
general we have had in Iraq, who is the author of the counterinsurgency 
policy, said it is a significant change and it will work. That is why I 
would say that while the resolution says it supports the troops, you 
are in effect undermining the new commander by challenging either his 
credibility or his competency. And that is a terrible message to the 
troops.
