Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, one can't help but feel grief and anger 
and desperation in all of what went on at Fort Hood.

But the larger issue here, and I think the one we must not lose sight 
of, is what Dr. Hasan was dealing with was posttraumatic stress 
disorder. I sat for 2 years at the Long Beach Naval Station and 
listened to these stories from young men and women coming back from 
Vietnam day after day after day, and I can tell you the impact is huge.

The biggest loss from this event will be if we do not deal with the 
fact that stigma about going to see mental health professionals 
prevents many of our people from getting the help they need.

I had dinner the other night with the Vice Chief of Staff of the 
United States Army, General Chiarelli, who has made it his goal to deal 
with posttraumatic stress disorder for the people of Iraq and 
Afghanistan wars.

This issue, because we sort of say, well, you're supposed to be tough 
and pull yourself together and never admit you've got a problem, is 
with all kinds of people in the military. A military psychiatrist is as 
vulnerable to it as is a grunt out on the field dealing with war at 
every corner. And as we talk about this today, I don't want people to 
draw conclusions and make decisions about why this happened and all the 
rest. It's human breakdown. It happens to people all the time in the 
military. When you put people in the kind of stress that we put those 
people in and send them back again and again and again, leave their 
families, see the awful things of it, you cannot expect everybody to be 
able to keep it together. We need to be sympathetic and put the money 
up for the help that these people need.
