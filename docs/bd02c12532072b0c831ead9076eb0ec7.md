Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my strong 
support for the supplemental aid funding that the House will be 
considering this week. This bill represents accountability to the 
taxpayers and a robust commitment to our national security and 
stability around the world.

In December, I had the privilege of visiting with our troops and 
military leaders in Afghanistan. I met with Americans who are doing 
incredible work to help the Afghani people take ownership of their 
economy and provide security in their neighborhoods. The 
administration's plan for refocusing our attention on Afghanistan 
incorporates both the U.S. military component but also builds up 
training for the Afghan military and police, government reforms, 
funding for economic development, and training of the Afghan people to 
grow alternative crops and build roads and irrigation systems.

I want to ensure that our troops in Afghanistan are as safe as 
possible. Therefore, I'm proud to support the fiscal 2009 supplemental 
bill which includes $2.2 billion more than requested for mine-
resistant, ambush-protected vehicles to protect our troops. Not only is 
it imperative that we provide servicemembers everything they need to 
complete their mission safely, we must also provide them with 
everything they have earned upon their return to civilian life.

Our troops and their families have given everything to this mission. 
We know that some of our troops have missed family milestones, others 
have suffered financial setbacks, and many others have experienced 
psychological trauma. This bill provides for expanded counseling 
services, state-of-the-art equipment for our wounded warriors, and 
funds to reintegrate our troops back into civilian life and the 
workforce when they return home.

Some members of the military were told that their service would last 
a certain amount of time, and then they were told that they would be 
''stop-lossed''--that means that their tour would be extended. To me, 
this shows a certain amount of disrespect for those who put on the 
uniform. It was a difficult decision to ask them to go back, but there 
also needs to be a sense of fairness on how they're compensated for 
that. It doesn't help their readiness or our readiness for our national 
security to have low morale among our troops. That is why I am very 
proud that this supplemental retroactively pays servicemembers and 
veterans $500 for every month that they've served under stop-loss 
orders since 2001. This is long overdue, and it's the right thing to 
do.

Our troops in Afghanistan will also be safer if we find regional 
solutions; that will include strengthening our current initiatives in 
Pakistan. Recently, General Petraeus, who is doing an excellent job for 
us, came to Palm Beach County in Florida in my district. We talked 
about it, and he told me--and I think we all understand this, as 
members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, that Pakistan and Afghanistan 
have become a single threat and a single issue because of this threat.

Training the Pakistani security forces to confront the Taliban will 
help the Pakistani Government regain its foothold and prevent it from 
being a failed state, which is an unacceptable threat to us and the 
region. This could not be more urgent. Our aid must communicate 
security priorities, including the Pakistani Government's assurances to 
safeguard the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and also to secure 
the nuclear facilities and weapons that they have.

Lastly, I would like to touch upon how the supplemental aid bill 
treats aid to the Middle East.

President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and Special Envoy Mitchell have 
provided U.S. leadership in the region to advance the causes of peace 
and security. However, the engagement would become more difficult if 
the Palestinians were to form a national unity government, including 
Hamas.

I support our current policy--no aid to terrorist organizations, no 
aid to any group that incites violence, promotes and implements 
terrorist attacks, and kidnaps young men without regard to human 
rights. This bill that we're considering is clear: no aid to Hamas.

In the event that a unity government denounces violence, abides by 
PLO and PA agreements, and recognizes Israel as a Jewish state, then we 
can start the conversation about aid. In that case, according to this 
bill, if the President can certify that these conditions have been met, 
then aid can be released to the unity government and only under those 
circumstances.

Furthermore, current restrictions maintain that U.S. taxpayer funds 
to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, which administers aid to 
Palestinian refugees, may not be used or diverted to fund terrorism or 
any activities of a terrorist group. I would urge the State Department 
to ensure that these restrictions are followed in both the letter and 
the spirit of the law, and to remain absolutely vigilant in 
investigating any possible infractions.

Finally, I would like to continue to bring attention to the cause of 
Gilad Shalit, who remains captive by Hamas. He was kidnapped in 2006. I 
urge all interested parties, including Egypt, to use their influence to 
ensure his safe return. Though not included in the legislative 
language, I urge the State Department to make it clear to all aid 
recipients of this bill that Gilad's return remains a foreign policy 
priority.

Mr. Speaker, I conclude and ask for this legislation to be adopted by 
this House to send a strong message to our troops.
