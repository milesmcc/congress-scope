Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we have been at war in Iraq for 5 years, 
longer than we fought World War II. And notwithstanding all of the rosy 
predictions by this President and his staff, we are now stuck 
refereeing a civil war.

Our soldiers are to be praised; they have done an outstanding job. 
But our political leaders in Washington, including those in this 
Congress, should be strongly criticized for acquiescing and going along 
time and time again.

We are told that we need to stay the course for the sake of our 
standing in the world. But, Mr. Speaker, this war has diminished our 
standing in the world. Enough is enough. It is time to bring this war 
in Iraq to an end.
