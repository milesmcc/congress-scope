# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mrs. LOWEY â€” 15 February 2007`

Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, a violent civil war is raging in Iraq, 
with atrocities against innocent civilians mounting every day. Our 
troops, our brave troops, are caught in the crossfire, dying and being 
maimed driving on local roads, patrolling neighborhoods and moving 
about by helicopter. What is their mission today? What is the strategic 
objective of the escalation proposed by the President?

President Bush's plan to deploy 20,000 additional U.S. combat troops 
to Iraq is not a new strategy, and nothing I have seen or heard has 
convinced me that this escalation will make a positive difference in 
Iraq or hasten the safe return of U.S. troops. In fact, General Abizaid 
said that ''more American forces prevent the Iraqis from taking 
responsibility for their own future.''

Four previous troop surges between December 2003 and October 2006 
have not made a dent in the level of violence nor in the number of U.S. 
casualties. We have spent nearly $500 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
and yet inexplicably our troops still do not have the protection they 
need. Throughout this war, many in Congress have addressed the lack of 
equipment and protection for our troops. Now, military leaders are 
saying there are not enough armor kits and vehicles to protect these 
additional five brigades the President plans to send to Iraq. It is 
unacceptable to send more soldiers to Iraq, but it is unconscionable to 
send them without proper armaments or an explanation from the 
administration about how our troops will be protected.

Madam Speaker, 3,132 Americans in uniform have died and 23,417 have 
been wounded since the start of the war in Iraq. I visited our wounded 
soldiers at Walter Reed, Bethesda Naval Hospital, and, most recently, 
at Landstuhl Military Hospital in Germany during my visit to Iraq with 
the Speaker.

I stood at the bedside of a 23-year old severely wounded soldier, a 
soldier who was holding the hand of his 21-year old brother, currently 
serving in Iraq, and the hand of his father, who had also served in the 
Armed Forces, a soldier who will likely never come home. These families 
are making the ultimate sacrifice for our family. I am humbled by their 
commitment, their professionalism and dedication. We have a 
responsibility to our Armed


Forces, our citizens, and the constituents who have elected us to bring 
them home as quickly and safely as possible.

I am convinced that the thorough analysis and conclusions of the 
bipartisan Iraq Study Group are correct. Iraqi leaders must take 
responsibility for the country's security and government and we must 
engage the international community to work towards stability in the 
region. There is no military solution to the crisis in Iraq, and we 
cannot send more brave men and women to police a civil war.

As I have said many times before, there are no good solutions to the 
quagmire in Iraq. This war was ill-conceived, poorly planned and 
incompetently executed. The best military minds must now focus their 
efforts on the safe and responsible redeployment of our troops rather 
than on this escalation. I cannot support sending more of our brave men 
and women in uniform on a last-ditch, misguided mission.

We best support our troops, my colleagues, and our national 
interests, by adopting this resolution, and by expressing clearly on 
behalf of the American people our firm determination to change course 
in Iraq.
