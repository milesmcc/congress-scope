`Mr. STEARNS â€” 26 July 2010`

Mr. STEARNS. In conclusion, I think, as has been pointed out by Mr. 
Markey, this is a historic day. Twenty years ago, the Americans with 
Disabilities Act passed. I voted for it, I supported it. I think many 
people in my district and many of my friends have children who have 
disabilities. It's important that these individuals do not feel left 
out.

I think the eloquent arguments that we had 20 years ago are no less 
important today, particularly in light of the fact that the veterans 
that are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan are coming home with 
disabilities that will impair them. And they're in their twenties. 
These are young men and women that want to work. And for many of them, 
they'd like to go back to their team, but they can't. They must find 
employment. They must, in many ways, adjust and transition.

How much better will it be if they can use the Internet, if they can 
use the wireless devices that we have? And not to mention the myriad of 
new devices that are coming out. How important is this for them? Very 
important. So, today, I join with Mr. Markey and others to commend him 
for his hard work here and his effort, and I urge all my colleagues to 
support this bill.

With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
