Mr. LEE of New York. On December 26, our Nation lost a true hero.

Army Specialist Jason Johnston of Albion, New York, was killed in 
action in southern Afghanistan while serving on his second tour of 
duty. He volunteered to return, feeling a strong commitment to his 
fellow soldiers and insisting on joining them for a second deployment.

Specialist Johnston was an elite soldier, the top 1 percent, 
according to a major general with the U.S. Army at Fort Bragg, where 
Jason was stationed. His bravery was without question and his valor 
beyond measure.

It is because of the sacrifices that our Nation's brave soldiers like 
Specialist Johnston make each and every day in regions far across the 
globe that keep Americans sleeping safely at night.

Specialist Johnston was one of the Nation's finest soldiers. As his 
family said last week, he ''was a hometown hero who died serving the 
country he loved.'' He will be missed.
