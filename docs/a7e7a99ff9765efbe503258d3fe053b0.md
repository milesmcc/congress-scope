Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I rise to support my colleague 
for bringing this resolution forward. I want to congratulate him on 
that.

I rise today in support of H. Res. 1086, recognizing National Nurses 
Week on May 6 through May 12. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I'm 
proud to speak out in honor of our valiant, committed nurses who make 
our Nation and our loved ones safe and well. I pay special tribute to 
my esteemed colleagues in Congress who introduced this resolution and 
who are, themselves, nurses: The Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson of 
Texas, the Honorable Lois Capps of California, and the Honorable 
Carolyn McCarthy of my home State, New York.

Additionally, I want to pay special tribute to the nurses who are 
serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and the nurses who generally attend to 
those who suffer wounds from those conflicts.

Along with other health care professionals, a nurse is responsible 
for the treatment, safety, and recovery of acutely or chronically ill 
people. They also help to maintain a patient's health and provide 
treatment to those who are facing life-threatening emergencies like 9/
11 and Hurricane Katrina. Nurses are also involved in medical and 
nursing research and provide a wide range of nonclinical functions.

Today, there are 2.4 million registered nurses in the United States; 
92 percent of the registered nurses are women. There are 531,000 
licensed vocational nurses; 1.8 million is the number of nursing 
psychiatric and home health aides. We cannot do without them.

I greatly commend the American Nurses Association and the American 
Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and all of the nursing associations and 
academic institutions who train nurses and promote the advancement of 
the profession. I look forward to working with members of the 
associations, academia, and others in making certain that we continue 
to increase the amount of nurses.

In closing, I wish to thank my colleagues again, Congresswoman 
Johnson, Congresswoman Capps, and Congresswoman McCarthy for their 
leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this resolution. And I want to thank very much my colleague 
from Texas (Mr. Green) and, of course, others who have been involved in 
this resolution.
