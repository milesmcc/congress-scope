`Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky â€” 8 March 2007`

Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the legacy 
of a brave young man who lost his life serving in Iraq. Sergeant 
Phillip McNeill, who grew up in Owingsville, Kentucky, was killed in 
Iraq on January 20, 2007. Sergeant McNeill was serving with the 3rd 
Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, based in Fort Richardson, 
Alaska, when his Humvee was struck by an IED, bringing his bright young 
life to a tragic end.

Sergeant McNeill came from a family steeped in American military 
tradition. His military service was inspired by the brave men in his 
family who had served before him. His family described his dedication 
to his mission, saying that he ''believed in the cause and that he was 
a soldier who wanted to be over there.'' This was Sergeant McNeill's 
second tour in Iraq.

As we celebrate the spirit of this great soldier, my thoughts and 
prayers are with Sergeant Phillip McNeill's family and friends. We are 
humbled by Sergeant McNeill's dedication, and we are forever indebted 
to him for making the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation and for our 
freedom.
