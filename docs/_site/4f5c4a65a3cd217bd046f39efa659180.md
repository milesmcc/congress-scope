# EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT ADMINISTRATION'S SEPTEMBER 9, 2007 OIL DEAL

`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 25 September 2007`

Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express deep concern 
about the administration's involvement in an oil deal announced on 
September 9, 2007, between the U.S. company Hunt Oil and the Kurdistan 
Regional Government. This oil deal appears to benefit a large 
Republican donor and ally of President Bush and Vice President Cheney.

The recent oil deal between the U.S.-based Hunt Oil Company and the 
Kurdistan Regional Government raises numerous questions. Hunt Oil, a 
privately held oil company based in Texas, and its founder, Ray Hunt, 
have close ties to Vice President Cheney and are large donors to 
President Bush. The deal appears to undercut the goal of oil revenue 
sharing but is predictably consistent with the administration's attempt 
to privatize Iraqi oil assets.

This war is about oil. The Bush administration desires private 
control of Iraqi oil, but we have no right to force Iraq to give up 
their oil. We have no right to set preconditions for Iraq which lead 
Iraq to giving up control of their oil. The constitution of Iraq 
designates that the oil of Iraq is the property of all Iraqi people.

The Administration has misled Congress and the media into thinking 
that pending Iraqi oil legislation before Iraq's Parliament was about 
the fair distribution of oil revenue. But the Hunt Oil deal with 
Kurdistan exposes the real intent of that legislation, promotion of a 
privatization scheme.

The Hunt Oil deal with Kurdistan suggests the war has made foreign 
access to Iraqi oil a reality. Because the connections between Hunt Oil 
Company and the Bush administration are numerous, I have asked the 
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to investigate Hunt Oil's 
ties to the Bush Administration and Halliburton.

The contract between Hunt Oil and Kurdistan would be the first of its 
kind in the Middle East where oil has been nationalized for decades and 
foreign oil companies have had no presence. The lack of consensus on 
how to manage the Iraqi oil resources suggests that the Hunt Oil 
Company deal could lead to greater instability within Iraq.

I have sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urging an 
immediate investigation into the implications of the Hunt Oil Company's 
recent production sharing agreement for petroleum exploration with 
Kurdistan on U.S. and Iraqi national security.

Congress should put a stop to the outrageous exploitation of a nation 
already in shambles due to U.S. intervention. I will soon introduce 
legislation to prevent all U.S. companies from gaining financial 
interests in Iraq's oil resources. I hope my colleagues will join me to 
ensure that the people of Iraq are not made to endure greater suffering 
and injustice that has already occurred because of this illegal and 
unjust war.


















Congress of the United States,




















 House of representatives,
























 September 18, 2007.


 Hon. Condoleezza Rice,


 Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.



 Dear Secretary Rice: To assure the national security of the 


 U.S. and Iraq I urge an immediate investigation into Hunt Oil 


 Company's recent production sharing agreement for petroleum 


 exploration with Kurdistan. The Iraq Central Government 


 reportedly considers this agreement illegitimate. As such, a 


 thorough investigation assessing the threat posed by the 


 agreement to U.S. and Iraqi national security interests 


 should be conducted promptly.



 The Constitution of Iraq designates that the oil of Iraq is 


 the property of all Iraqi people. Thus, it is unsurprising 


 that the Iraqi Central Government believes that the oil 


 production sharing agreement between Hunt Oil Company and the 


 Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is illegal. The agreement 


 is reportedly based on oil law passed by the KRG and is the 


 subject of much legal debate. The lack of consensus on how to 


 manage the Iraqi oil resources suggest that the Hunt Oil 


 Company deal could lead to greater instability within Iraq.



 As you are undoubtedly aware, the contract between Hunt Oil 


 and the KRG would be the first of its kind in the Middle East 


 where oil has been nationalized for decades. Foreign oil 


 companies have had no presence in the Middle East for 


 decades. The legality




 of this matter is of obvious importance to the people of Iraq 


 who have a constitutional right to the oil resources of Iraq.



 Furthermore, close ties between Hunt Oil Company and the 


 Administration's top officials coupled with this precedent 


 setting agreement appears morally debased. The following will 


 assist in clarifying this connection: Ray Hunt, CEO of Hunt 


 Oil Company, was twice appointed to a seat on the President's 


 Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). Mr. Hunt raised 


 campaign funds for President George H.W. and George W. Bush. 


 He also personally donated $20,000 to the Republican National 


 Committee's Victory Fund for the current President Bush. Ray 


 Hunt gave $100,000 toward the 2001 Bush inaugural 


 festivities and one of his corporations, Hunt 


 Consolidated, gave another $250,000 toward the Bush 2005 


 presidential inaugural gala. In addition, Ray Hunt donated 


 $35 million toward the Bush library/think tank to secure 


 additional property for the project.



 This unmatched deal struck by the Hunt Oil Company coupled 


 with the company's ties to the administration could be viewed 


 as hostile to the interests of Iraq amidst growing knowledge 


 of Iraqi opposition to privatization and sale of Iraq's 


 national oil reserves.



 Your investigation should address how the agreement will 


 affect Iraqi public sentiment toward the Iraqi and U.S. 


 governments, insurgent efforts, the stability of Iraq and the 


 stated goals of U.S. policy to bring peace and stability to 


 the region.



 I look forward to your timely response and the conclusions 


 of your investigation.





 Sincerely,























 Dennis J. Kucinich,


 Member of Congress.
