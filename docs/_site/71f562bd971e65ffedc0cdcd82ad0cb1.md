`Mr. WELCH of Vermont â€” 22 March 2007`

Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Yes, I do. Every American is appalled at what 
was revealed, the degrading circumstances for our troops at Walter 
Reed. There were many things that were obviously disturbing about it, 
the vermin, the rodents, the peeling paint, the unsanitary conditions.

But that is the tip of the iceberg. What was really heartbreaking 
when you met the veterans was that they were completely lost and 
abandoned. We had people with head injuries that had very severe 
cognitive problems who were in an administrative morass and nightmare. 
They were abandoned really for 4 months before anyone knew that they 
were there.


We had amputees who were a mile away from where they needed to be 
without prosthetics and were supposed to somehow find a way to walk to 
where their doctors' appointments were. The administrative breakdown 
was enormous, and it really reflected a culture of disregard.

One of the things that came out as we started investigating this 
situation out at Walter Reed was that the breakdown of services was 
very predictable because there was a substantial reduction in the 
number of personnel that were needed to provide the services.

Step one, you know that if you are having significant increased 
military activity in Iraq and Afghanistan, you have to anticipate you 
will have an increasing need for services to treat injured soldiers.

Two, in response to that, the government, the Bush administration, 
following its ideological hard line about privatization, put to bid 
certain services that were being offered at Walter Reed. It turned out 
that the government workers who were government workers had an 
opportunity to bid on that. They had the lowest bid. Mysteriously, and 
we still haven't gotten to the bottom of this, Madam Speaker, their bid 
was adjusted upward $7 million, not by them, but by the reviewer of 
bids. They then came in second, and the contract was awarded to a 
private company, IAP Worldwide Services.

Now, we don't know what the bottom-line connection is. What we do 
know is the following: Number one, what had been personnel of 300 went 
to 50. Now, it is cheaper to have 50 people on the payroll than it is 
to have 300, but you also don't get the job done, especially when the 
number of wounded soldiers is increasing. So that is shocking right 
away.

Number two, this company, IAP, had all kinds of problems, even though 
it received millions and millions of dollars doing Katrina relief.

Number three, the head of the IAP Company is a former very high 
executive in Halliburton, a company that I just have to say has ripped 
off the American taxpayer and made billions of dollars on this war in 
Iraq.

Now, how is it that there is a disposition that is so powerful that 
you put privatization and ideology ahead of a bottom line, the 
nonnegotiable bottom line that you are going to provide the services 
that our men and women in the service returning from Afghanistan, 
returning from Iraq need? It is absolutely and completely unacceptable. 
That shouldn't be a bipartisan thing. We ought to be doing whatever it 
takes to make certain that our men and women do get the services that 
they need.

Lack of accountability makes people lax. They are not looking over 
their shoulder knowing that somebody is going to be checking to find 
out if they are getting the job done, if they are ripping off 
taxpayers, if they are performing up to standards.

That is a major responsibility. We are candid with one another. We 
know that people are pretty fed up with government. The reason, there 
are a lot of reasons for it, but one of them is they don't have 
confidence that we are taking care of their taxpayer dollars. That gets 
so embedded in people's sense that they lose faith that the government 
will be there when there is a Katrina, when our soldiers are coming 
home from Iraq. Our job, together, is to restore that confidence by 
performance, not by talk; by accountability.
