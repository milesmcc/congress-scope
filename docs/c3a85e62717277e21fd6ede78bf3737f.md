Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, as chairwoman of the House 
Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, I strongly support the 
Injunctive Relief for Veterans Act, H.R. 6225.

Now, early in the 110th Congress I introduced the Veterans Education 
Tuition Support Act, or H.R. 2910, to guarantee tuition reimbursement 
and readmission for every servicemember deployed while attending 
college. Now, I did that because I had heard from a number of 
servicemembers about their situations. Many reported that they had 
problems during activations, including harassment from bill collectors 
for tuition, and difficulty re enrolling back into school.

Our men and women in uniform already face unthinkable levels of 
pressure and stress while fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they 
deserve to know that they will treated fairly by their institution and 
can easily return to their studies after the mission is over.

I am pleased that Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin has included provisions 
from H.R. 2910 into H.R. 6225, and I want to thank the committee for 
taking up this very important issue.
