Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3793, the 
Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007. I am proud to be a cosponsor of 
this legislation because I believe the men and women who bravely serve 
our country deserve everything they are promised when they sign up for 
the military. This bill ensures those forced to leave military service 
because of a combat injury will receive the bonuses they are entitled 
to. Moreover, this bill recognizes that the men and women injured in 
battle, in Iraq and Afghanistan, would much rather be with their 
brothers and sisters in the field than in a hospital nursing their 
wounds. The least we can do is afford them with the benefits, pay, and 
assistance to which they are already entitled.

I would like to thank Congressman Altmire for his tireless work on 
this legislation. It is a fine example of how the Democratic Congress 
is keeping its promises to our dedicated men and women valiantly 
fighting on behalf of our country. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act.
