Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

My friend from New York, a fellow member of the Armed Services 
Committee, Mr. McHugh, a good friend, I must agree with him on one 
comment that he made when he said, I am troubled by the course that 
lies ahead.

Madam Speaker, I am very troubled about the course that lies ahead. 
That is what we are about this evening. We have seen an irretrievable 
strategic mistake made in Iraq that put us where we are. And 
consequently it brings us to this point where we express our concern 
and disagreement with the increase in troops in this crucial time in 
Iraq and allows us the opportunity to say thank you. We are proud of 
you, each of you who wears the American uniform.

Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Rush), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.

(Mr. RUSH asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
