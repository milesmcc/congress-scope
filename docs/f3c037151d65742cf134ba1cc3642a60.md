# EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `f3c037151d65742cf134ba1cc3642a60`
`Mr. LEVIN â€” 17 February 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. The majority of the American people believe that a deeper 
military involvement in Iraq won't make success more likely. I believe 
a majority of Senators feel the same way. I hope the majority will be 
allowed to so vote. If we believe plunging into Baghdad neighborhoods 
with more American troops will not increase chances of success, we are 
dutybound to say so, and a minority of Senators should not thwart that 
expression. We owe that to the troops. We owe that to their families, 
and we owe that to the American people.

I yield the floor.
