# DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008

`Mr. OBEY â€” 12 June 2007`

Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.

Let me, once again, not that anyone on the other side of the aisle is 
interested in listening to facts, but let me, once again, cite what the 
facts are. We keep hearing this mythical, robotic claim from the other 
side of the aisle that somehow these earmarks are going to be dropped 
in in conference.

Well, it is not our fault that you couldn't finish the budget last 
year and we had to finish your work. It is not our fault that you 
couldn't finish the work on the Iraqi bill for 2007, so we had to spend 
the last 3 months cleaning up your mess on that one.













Announcement By the Chairman
