Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, the new Democratic-led House has been 
listening to the American people and working to take our Nation in a 
new direction. We've passed a wide range of measures to strengthen our 
military, grow our economy and support working families, many with 
bipartisan support.

For example, so far this year, we've passed legislation implementing 
the
9/11 Commission recommendations, approved a budget that achieves a 
balance in 5 years, passed sweeping congressional ethics reform, 
repealed big oil subsidies, invested funds in renewable energy and 
increased the minimum wage.

But the President continues his stubborn opposition to this new 
direction that we are providing on Iraq and on key domestic measures. 
He does not support or has threatened to veto about two-thirds of the 
important work we've already provided.

Mr. Speaker, our priorities are America's priorities. It's time the 
President stops obstructing our agenda and begins working with us to 
improve the lives of all Americans.
