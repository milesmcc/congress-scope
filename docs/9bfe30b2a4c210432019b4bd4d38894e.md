Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party and the 
President will make it clear today to the American people that they own 
this war; hook, line and sinker.

The President and his Republican colleagues will be successful today 
in continuing the Iraq war, but this is a pyrrhic victory at best. The 
Democratic leadership is allowing this bill to pass because, unlike the 
President, they will not leave our troops unprotected in battle. It is 
our troops and their families that are the only ones being asked to 
make any sacrifice in this war, and this President's policy is unworthy 
of their sacrifice.

The only sacrifice requested of the rest of us has been to go out and 
spend our tax cuts at the mall. Meanwhile, the Iraqi parliament is 
preparing to take the summer off, probably using some of the missing $9 
billion to sunbathe along the Mediterranean. Our soldiers risk life and 
limb to secure their country, which is in the midst of a civil war, and 
they go on vacation. Ask yourself if you think this is a war worthy of 
our soldiers' sacrifice.

We Democrats will do everything, legally and legislatively, to bring 
our troops home as soon and as safely as possible. That is our pledge 
to the American people, and we will keep it.
