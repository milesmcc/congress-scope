`Mr. REID â€” 31 January 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the vote is called, I wish to alert 
everyone here that the distinguished Republican leader and I are 
negotiating, trying to work something out on Iraq, which is the next 
issue we will go to when we finish this bill, which will be tomorrow 
sometime. It is very possible we are going to have a vote Monday at 
noon on the Iraq issue--everyone should understand that--Monday at 
noon. We hope that be can avoided, but we may not be able to avoid it. 
The Republican leader and I are doing our best to work something out. 
We have had a number of meetings, and we will continue to do that 
throughout the day.
