Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, on Sunday in a speech at Miami 
Dade College, the President said to graduating students, ''One of the 
great strengths of America is that the most important issues are 
decided by the will of the people.''

Today, on the fourth anniversary of ''Mission Accomplished,'' the 
President is faced with a choice: either listen to the will of the 
American people to refocus our strengths to win the war on terror by 
signing the emergency supplemental bill or continue to send our brave 
men and women into harm's way to police a religious civil war.

Madam Speaker, today the President will decide if he will veto our 
bill and, in doing so, deny critical funding for our troops and for our 
veterans. His veto will let our troops down by not giving them the 
rest, the equipment, and training they need.

Madam Speaker, today all Americans need to pray for our President. We 
need to pray for wisdom. We need to pray that he listens to his 
advisers, his generals, the Iraqi people. And, most importantly, we 
pray that he will listen to the will of the American people.
