`Ms. GRANGER â€” 22 June 2010`

Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Marine Sergeant 
Zachary Walters who was killed in Helmand, Afghanistan on June 8, 2010 
while serving with the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine 
Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force based out of Camp Lejeune, 
North Carolina.

Sergeant Walters attended Flagler Palm Coast High School and was a 
member of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC). He 
graduated in 2005 and joined the United States Marine Corps the next 
day, passing up college scholarships and job offers so he could serve 
the country he loved. During his initial tour in the Marine Corps, he 
deployed from August 2008 to March 2009 in support of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom.

After his initial enlistment was complete, Sergeant Walters could 
have returned to civilian life, but he instead chose to re-enlist in 
the Marine Corps. Sergeant Walters learned that the Marines whom he had 
trained would be deployed to Afghanistan, and he felt it was his duty 
to lead the Marines he had prepared into combat. He selflessly chose to 
answer the call once again. Sergeant Walters shipped out in May for 
Afghanistan, just days before his 24th birthday.

Sergeant Walters lost his life to a roadside bomb while doing what he 
had chosen to do: leading men into combat. Our Nation can never repay 
the debt we owe to this brave man and his family. Sergeant Walters 
represents the best values of this Nation and the Marine Corps, 
embodying the Corps' values of Honor, Courage and Commitment.

I cannot state it any better than Sergeant Walters' mother, Regina 
Walters, did, when she said: ''I've never been prouder in my life. My 
precious boy made the ultimate sacrifice. He would not have had it any 
other way.''

I wish to extend my condolences to Sergeant Walters' family and hope 
that they continue to find solace in his lasting impact on both his 
grateful Nation and his proud Corps.
