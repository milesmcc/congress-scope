Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
United States Marine Corps Sergeant Clinton W. Ahlquist of Creede, 
Colorado, who was killed in the line of duty while serving his country 
honorably in Iraq.

Sergeant Ahlquist wore his Nation's uniform proudly, and we should 
all pay tribute to this brave and courageous young man.

Every day our men and women in uniform willingly face unknown dangers 
as part of the effort to promote peace and democracy throughout the 
world. Their individual stories of honor and courage must not be 
forgotten.

Clinton Ahlquist moved to Creede, Colorado, during his freshman year 
of high school. Clinton touched countless lives during his 3 years at 
Creede High School.

Ahlquist was killed in Ar Ramadi, Iraq on Tuesday, February 20, 2007, 
by an improvised explosive device while patrolling a Medivac 
helicopter. He was 20 years old.

My heart goes out to Clinton's family and friends and those whose 
lives he touched throughout his service to our country. I am humbled by 
their strength and perseverance in the face of such hardship.

Sergeant Ahlquist died performing noble deeds, serving and protecting 
his fellow countrymen. Clinton and his family and friends have 
exhibited a rare form of selflessness and courage.

Madam Speaker, I submit this recognition to the United States House 
of Representatives in honor of their sacrifice so that Clinton W. 
Ahlquist may live on in memory.
