Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 377, the 
United States-Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program Act.

This bill, introduced by Senator Lugar, and already passed by the 
Senate in March, would establish a formal parliamentary youth exchange 
program for American and Polish secondary students. The purpose of this 
exchange program is to demonstrate to the youth of Poland and to the 
United States the benefits of friendly cooperation based on our shared 
political and cultural values.

The United States and Poland have enjoyed close bilateral relations 
since the end of the Cold War. Poland has supported U.S.-led efforts to 
fight global terrorism, has contributed troops to coalition forces in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, and has cooperated closely with the United States 
to promote democracy and human rights around the world and to reform 
the United Nations.



By focusing on the source of our common future, our young people, 
this bill will further cement the friendship and the ideals that our 
two nations already


share. Therefore, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this 
worthwhile endeavor.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
