Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Chairman, this President has used the resolution 
that we passed some years ago as a blank check to take us into a 
disastrous situation in Iraq, leaving Afghanistan half done.

What we are trying to do with this amendment is simply say to the 
President, you have to stay where we put the money. If you want to come 
out and go after Iran in a preemptive way, as you did against Iraq when 
you had no evidence, when you came to this floor and presented evidence 
that


turned out not to be true, and use that as a pretext for going into 
war, we are heading for in Iran, in my view, another Gulf of Tonkin 
kind of situation, where you cook up a situation.

This administration took down the border between Iran and Iraq and 
now complains to us everywhere that we are getting all kinds of weapons 
coming in from Iran. Using that as a pretext, the Arab press yesterday 
reports that the Vice President was in the Middle East telling people 
that war is coming, telling them that the problems in Iraq don't keep 
us out of anything. They won't be any hindrance to us going into Iran.

This amendment is simply an attempt to put a minor block in the way 
of this administration's desire to widen this war, probably to get 
people's minds off how bad it is in Iraq.

This is supposed to be winding down in Iraq because of the 
escalation. But in fact that is not what is happening. We are losing 
more soldiers every day. We have had the bloodiest months in this war.

This amendment is simply to say the United States Congress will 
decide where this country goes to war, not the President, who wants to 
go out and create whatever situation he wants in the world.

I urge the adoption of this amendment.
