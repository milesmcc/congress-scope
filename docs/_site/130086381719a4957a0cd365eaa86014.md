Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan. I 
appreciate the fact we will vote in 10 minutes. I think we have an 
opportunity to do something both very important and together, both of 
which are important. It is Senators collectively blowing the whistle on 
the Iranians and telling them we know what they are doing and that we 
know it is resulting in the death of American soldiers in Iraq, and 
they better stop it. It is as simple as that. They can read into that 
whatever else they want. But so far as they may believe in Tehran that 
they can take advantage of what they view as political differences in 
the United States or partisan differences, I think this does give us 
the opportunity, across party lines and every other potential divider, 
including our position on the war in Iraq, to say: When we have 
evidence a foreign nation is contributing to the death of American 
soldiers, we are going to stand together against that.

So I appreciate very much the work we have done. I am honored that 
Senator McCain is a cosponsor. I am honored again that Senator Levin 
has become a cosponsor. I think we have the opportunity now to do 
something very united and important.

I thank the Chair, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
