Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise to express my sympathy over the 
loss of United States Marine Corps Corporal Adrian Robles of 
Scottsbluff, NE. Corporal Robles died on October 22 from injuries he 
sustained while supporting combat operations in Helmand province in 
southern Afghanistan.

A graduate of Scottsbluff High School, Corporal Robles, who was 21 
years old, was an exemplary marine. Throughout his service, which 
included a tour in Iraq during 2006, Corporal Robles received three 
medals of Good Conduct from the Marine Corps; two Sea Service 
Deployment Ribbons; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; the Iraq Campaign 
Medal; the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; the National Defense 
Service Medal; and the Purple Heart.

All of Nebraska is proud of Corporal Robles' service to our country, 
as well as the thousands of brave men and women serving in the U.S. 
Armed Forces.

Corporal Robles is remembered as a devoted son and brother. He is 
survived by his parents Cesar and Yolanda; sister Beatriz; and 
stepsiblings Cesar and Ricardo Robles and Yovana Chaparro.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring U.S. 
Marine Corps Corporal Adrian Robles.
