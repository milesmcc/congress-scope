Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I think the comments from the last speaker are very enlightening on 
this debate because we have heard for month after month the same 
arguments made time and time again, and the bottom line is there are a 
number of Members who are not for these authorities that allow our 
national security professionals to listen to terrorist communications. 
And there are a number of people who would just as soon let the Protect 
America Act expire and let it go out of effect. As the gentleman who 
just spoke said, we don't need it to protect the country.



But there are others of us who believe that we do need such 
authorities to protect the country, and a very large number of Members 
of the other body have just voted on a proposal that would do that.

And so my position, Mr. Speaker, is give us a chance to vote on it. 
We hear


excuse after excuse. We need more documents, we need more information, 
we need more legal opinions, we need 14 days, we need 21 days. But we 
have been debating the same issues month after month. Nothing has 
changed. No more information, no document is going to change the basic 
position the country stands in today and, that is, a law expires on 
Friday, and if the people for whom we have given the responsibility to 
protect the country are to do their job, that law is going to have to 
be made permanent so they can count on it, not dribbling it out a few 
weeks at a time, not treating them the way we treat soldiers in Iraq 
and Afghanistan by giving them funding just a few months at a time, but 
giving them the authority they need to do their job.

I suggest the best way to do that is to bring up the bill that has 
already passed the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and 
give us a chance to vote on it. There will be some Members who vote 
''no.'' They think we don't need that authority. They think the Protect 
America Act is not needed. But I suggest a majority will vote ''yes'' 
and it will pass and the country will be safer.
