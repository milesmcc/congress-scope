Mr. BOREN. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for all the hard work you and 
the entire staff have done on this legislation.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2701, the Intelligence 
Authorization Act of 2010. This bill is an excellent product and 
addresses many critical areas, including those that have previously 
received little attention. One of the most important provisions in the 
bill is the commitment to developing foreign language capability, 
specifically in African languages that have historically been 
underrepresented in the intelligence community.

The bill creates a pilot program under the National Security 
Education Program, or the NSEP. It expands the David L. Boren Scholars 
by requiring the Director of National Intelligence to identify five 
high-priority African languages for which language education programs 
do not currently exist. The NSEP would then develop intensive training 
programs for implementation in both the United States and in countries 
where the languages are spoken.

Let's not forget that 10 years ago, we didn't anticipate conflicts 
along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and the need for Dari, Pashto, 
and Urdu speakers. When the need arose, we didn't have the capabilities 
to meet immediate demands, and to this day, we are still playing 
catchup. Similarly, we cannot predict from where the next crisis will 
emerge. But by recognizing the current instability in the Horn of 
Africa, Sudan, and Congo, we can anticipate crises that may impact U.S. 
national security interests in the near future. We should be training 
the linguists and translators in the relevant languages now so that, 
once again, we are not reactive in our efforts but proactive in our 
actions. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
