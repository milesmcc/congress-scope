# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `4ed21bbb68b155e952e84e3d79eadfa5`
`Mr. MEEHAN â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

With all due respect to my friend from New Mexico, I want to make the 
point that this resolution does not do anything to stop funding for the 
troops. As a matter of fact, it was this administration that sent 
140,000 troops into harm's way without up-armoring Humvees. There is 
nothing in this to cut funding for the troops. But this administration 
sent 140,000 troops into harm's way without up-armored Humvees, without 
Kevlar vests. And what did Secretary Rumsfeld say? He said you go to 
war with the Army you have, not the Army you wish you had.

We are the United States of America. We should never go into harm's 
way, never go into harm's way, without up-armored Humvees and Kevlar 
vests.

The Washington Post did a front page piece just the other day. It 
says that we still don't have the most effective up-armored Humvees 
that are available in the United States. It is not acceptable. It is 
inexcusable and indefensible.

I will be going to Iraq in a few days. I expect to see a country, 
unfortunately, that has gotten worse and worse in terms of the level of 
violence than the one I visited in 2003 and in January of 2005.

When I came back in January of 2005 I presented a strategy, a white 
paper, entitled ''Iraq: The Light at the End of the Tunnel.'' Many of 
those recommendations were included in a bipartisan Iraq Study Group 
with distinguished experts on foreign policy and military affairs. They 
didn't call for more troops in Iraq. What they called for was for 
America to go into the background.

The simple facts bear out a true grim reality. We are told that we 
are going to rebuild the country's infrastructure. But here are the 
facts. Iraq has less electricity than it did before the war. Residents 
of Baghdad get 4/1/2/ hours of electricity now, one-quarter of what 
they expected before the war.

We were told that oil revenues would pay the entire cost of the way. 
But here are the facts. Iraq produces less oil today than it did before 
the war. Instead of funding the war, oil is turned out at about half 
the rate it was when Saddam was in power.

The bad news continues. Skyrocketing unemployment, decreasing levels 
of drinkable water and a security situation that has deteriorated into 
a full-blown civil war.

Now the President wants, in face of the recommendations of experts, 
to send 21,500 more troops into this situation. Does the President 
really think that the surge will stabilize the security system long 
enough to undo all the failures of the last 4 years? I cannot honestly 
believe that this is the best strategy and the collective wisdom of the 
Department of Defense, of


the State Department and of the intelligence community.

You know what I see? I see a President who seems to be desperate to 
divert attention away from the missteps, away from holding people 
accountable, and to just hold on to Iraq as long as he can and let the 
next administration deal with it. When I watched his speech, when I 
listened to Secretary Gates describe it, I saw nothing that gave me the 
impression that the escalation would do any good in the long term.

When we need to encourage them, Shias, Sunnis and Kurds, instead we 
are alienating. When we need to be standing up Iraqi security forces so 
our men and women can stand down, instead we are undercutting. When we 
need to be engaging Iraq's neighbors, instead we are on a war path with 
Iran. We need to fundamentally change our approach in Iraq, and this 
plan is more of the same.

I admit that the escalation we are debating will accomplish a number 
of things. It will endanger more American lives. It will continue to 
erode our national security. It will continue around the world to keep 
America up front in the war in Iraq, creating more terrorists and more 
insurgents, not less. It will deplete our military's resources, which 
are already stretched to the limit. And this plan will again ask our 
soldiers and marines to leave their families and return to the war zone 
that they have just left.

I stand here today with a simple message: Mr. President, the American 
people want a policy that changes direction. We urge you to rethink 
this policy of escalating the war in Iraq.
