`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 25 June 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Larson, I just want to thank you for not 
only your passion but your leadership. Again, I go back to third-party 
validators. I go back to the will and the desire. Many times we stood 
here on this floor and talked about, Mr. Speaker, if you give us the 
opportunity, if we become the majority, what we would do. Six months 
hasn't really even clicked by yet. Let's just say 7 months hasn't. We 
haven't enjoyed 7 months of being in the majority of this House. It 
just happened in January, and we're talking late January, mid-January, 
where the power changed here in this House of Representatives.

And the bills, the 47 major bills, at least three actions that we 
have taken, on the action we have taken on Iraq alone, major. The 
hearings that we've had in the Foreign Affairs Committee, double-digit 
hearings. Armed Services Committee, double-digit hearings. In 
Government Oversight, double-digit hearings. You didn't hear about 
these hearings because they weren't called in the last Republican 
Congress.

Mr. Larson, when you were talking, I couldn't help but pull out of my 
book of information here, because every day we open this book, Mr. 
Speaker, and we find things, we call the National Archives, we call 
committees, we want to know what's going on here in this House, we want 
to know the Members that are trying to push these issues, moving in a 
new direction.

There's a bill, H.R. 13, by Sam Farr. He has nine cosponsors on that 
bill which is a bill that he has been working on. Representative Lynn 
Woolsey has legislation to bring the troops home, Iraq Sovereignty 
Restoration Act. Mr. Farr's legislation is to repeal Authorization for 
the Use of Military Forces Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, Public Law 
107-243, and require withdrawal of U.S. Armed Forces from Iraq. That's 
the title of his bill.



We move on to Representative David Price, who has a Comprehensive 
Strategy for Iraq Act of '07 which would withdraw troops as quickly as 
possible from Iraq. He has a list of cosponsors that are moving down 
that line.
