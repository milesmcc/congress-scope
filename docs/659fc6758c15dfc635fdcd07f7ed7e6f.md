Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that 
I rise today to offer my condolences to the families of 1st Lt. Kevin 
Gaspers, of Hastings, and Burwell native Staff Sgt. Kenneth Locker, who 
were laid to rest last week with honor. They lost their lives, along 
with seven other soldiers of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, in a 
terrorist attack in Iraq.

These young men represented some of the best qualities of Nebraskans, 
and our State mourns their loss.

Locker has been described as compassionate, caring, thoughtful, and 
generous. Before he died, he told his father he was fighting in Iraq 
for the children, that they might have a safer world to live in. His 
sacrifice for that idea should be inspiring for us all.

Gaspers also had a reputation of generosity, sincerity, and 
dedication. He touched so many lives during his time with us, and the 
outpouring of support from the community has been nothing short of 
inspiring.

These young men led lives rich in meaning, and it is tragic to see 
those lives cut short. They were sons, friends, and role models. They 
were filled with kindness, selflessness, and humor. My heart and 
thoughts go out to their families during this difficult period.
