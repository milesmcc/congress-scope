Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am glad I was here to hear the remarks 
of the distinguished Senator from Hawaii. I serve on that subcommittee 
of Defense Appropriations with him and get to observe, at close range, 
the skill and effort and courtesy that is reflected in his service as 
chairman of our committee. It is a pleasure to serve with him and it is 
an honor. He has provided leadership and cooperation in working with 
all Senators--not just members of our committee--to move forward in 
carrying out of duties by the Department of Defense through our 
appropriations process.

It is very important that the Senate approve, as soon as possible, 
the funding that is contained in the bill that our committee has 
reported to the Senate. It will help support and provide the resources 
necessary to carry out the missions of our men and women have in 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the world, safeguarding our freedom, 
protecting our security interests.

The Department of Defense is now operating under a continuing 
resolution that expires on Friday. This is an inefficient way of 
managing the support for our Department of Defense. It causes too much 
effort to be made by employees and men and women in the Defense 
Department, focusing on management, how to manage day-to-day operating 
expenses dealing with the challenges that too few dollars are provided 
in a way that gives people time to plan and then execute efficiently 
their missions and responsibilities.

This affects the support that is available to the men and women who 
are overseas and in harm's way.

The act contains funds necessary to provide medical care as well as 
family support for members of our Armed Forces and their families. 
During this time of war, it is very important that every effort be made 
to provide good medical care for those who are injured and wounded 
serving our country.

It is also important we support the families. There are funds in this 
legislation that do just that, trying to address the stresses that are 
associated with combat and deployment and separation.

I am disappointed the normal process has been circumvented, or at 
least delayed, and the other body has not appointed conferees to the 
Defense Appropriations conference committee. It is a disappointment 
also that the Defense Appropriations bill is used as a vehicle to move 
other initiatives that seem to be slowing down the process. These 
measures should be considered separately and addressed in a more 
thoughtful way, based on their own merits, not on the legislation they 
are tied to, to carry them through the legislative process.

I think attaching nondefense-related legislation to the Defense 
Appropriations Act for this fiscal year has been a mistake. It has been 
unnecessary, unfortunate, and it has resulted in delays and 
uncertainty.

I am sure there are Senators who can make suggestions for improving 
this bill. We are open to hear those concerns and do our best to 
respond to the suggestions from all Senators. We don't individually 
support all aspects of the agreement, but we think that, in total, it 
is a good bill. It ought to be passed, and it ought to be passed as 
soon as possible in recognition of our respect for our service members 
and their families.
