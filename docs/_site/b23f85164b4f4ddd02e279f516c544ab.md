Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I speak on behalf of the 12 to 14 million 
immigrants here in the United States.

Mr. Speaker, the memory of Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez will always 
remain in our hearts. Gutierrez, an undocumented immigrant who came 
here as an orphan from Guatemala, graduated from high school despite 
many obstacles. While in community college, he enlisted as a marine to 
show his patriotism and love for this Nation.

On March 31, 2003, Gutierrez became the first combat casualty of the 
war of Iraq. His belief in the American dream of a better life is a 
testament of what many others who come to this country wish to have. 
Gutierrez will forever be a symbol of patriotism, hard work, and 
commitment.

Sadly, his sacrifices are lost in the hateful anti-immigrant 
rhetoric. Every day, 12 to 14 million immigrants work from sunset to 
sundown to reach the American dream--all positively contributing to 
America's economic health.

I urge my colleagues to keep in mind these contributions and make a 
firm commitment to work towards comprehensive immigration reform.
