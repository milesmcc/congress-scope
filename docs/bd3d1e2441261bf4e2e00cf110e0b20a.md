`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to note 
that the Iraq Study Group specifically said the United States should 
significantly increase the number of U.S. military personnel, including 
combat troops embedded in and supporting Iraqi units.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. Pitts).
