Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, due to my attendance at the Arlington 
National Cemetery funeral of U.S. Army SGT John D. Rode, my constituent 
from Lake Mary who died from injuries inflicted by a terrorist IED in 
Iraq on February 14, 2007, I was unable to cast votes on rollcalls 106, 
107, and 108. Had I been present, I would have voted ''aye'' on each of 
these measures.
