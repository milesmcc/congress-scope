Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Buyer, I want to thank you also, because I do have 
a beautiful community, and we have a large number of both Afghan and 
Iraqi theatre soldiers that have come to the San Antonio area and the 
community there. We know that we have had our problems and our 
difficulties, but we are expanding those services, and I am extremely 
elated.

One thing I tell our veterans now is if they ever have had 
difficulties in the past, I am urging them to go back, go back and 
visit the VA. There is a lot of enthusiasm out there, and I am really 
pleased. Thank you very much for those comments, and you are welcome to 
come down and share a tequila.
