Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, it is with great 
sadness that I rise to pay tribute to U.S. Army First Sergeant Blue C. 
Rowe. Sergeant Rowe, a devoted husband and father, was a constituent of


mine from Whittier, California. This brave American was killed in 
action in Afghanistan on May 26, 2009, on the 15th anniversary of his 
service in the military.

Sergeant Rowe was killed by an improvised explosive device. The 33-
year old Rowe leaves behind his 7-year old son, Andrew, and his wife 
Cindy. My thoughts and prayers go out to Cindy and Andrew, and I hope 
that they can find some solace in the gratitude that our Nation owes to 
Sergeant Rowe for his honorable service to his countrymen.

Sergeant Rowe spent his entire adult life serving our country. He 
joined the Army in 1994 and served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Last 
July he mobilized again for duty in Afghanistan.

He and his family have made the greatest sacrifice that one can make, 
and we are forever in his debt.

Sergeant Rowe, whose life embodied the meaning of the word 
''patriot'', will be missed by family, friends and colleagues, but his 
honorable deeds will not be forgotten.
