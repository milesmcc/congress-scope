Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

The legislation before the House today extends certain expiring 
authorities of the Department of State. A couple of examples. The bill 
continues the Department's ability to hire experienced retired officer 
to fill positions in Iraq or Afghanistan. This bill extends two 
broadcasting authorities, Radio Free Asia for an additional year and 
the authority to hire personal service contractors in the United States 
for specialized language and other skills, and several other technical 
provisions involving those authorities.

I reserve the balance of my time.
