# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `8137e35dfe0b4aa79f6832e6a0f67957`
`Mr. DELAHUNT â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I would commend to my friends and colleagues who spoke 
previously that they take the time and review the National Intelligence 
Estimate that was released by the Bush administration in September of 
2006, because the American intelligence agencies found that the 
American invasion and occupation of Iraq has helped spawn a new 
generation of Islamic radicalism and that the overall terrorist threat 
has grown. What we want to accomplish is to defeat terrorism, but we 
are not doing it with this strategy.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. 
Ellsworth), a new Member of the House and a member of the Committee on 
Armed Services.

(Mr. ELLSWORTH asked and was given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.)
