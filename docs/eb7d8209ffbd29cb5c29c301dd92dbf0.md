Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of America's 
bravest, Corporal Chad Stafford Wade of Bentonville, Arkansas, who 
valiantly sacrificed his life in support of combat missions in 
Afghanistan. Corporal Wade was a devoted family man and friend who was 
known to make those around him laugh. He shared his zest for life 
through the small things he did that put a smile on the faces of those 
who loved him, demonstrating his love of music, singing his favorite 
country songs, and enjoying the outdoors.

Corporal Wade taught others the importance of service, joining the 
Marine Corps in October of 2007. He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 
1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force 
based in Camp Pendleton, California, and served in combat missions in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

My prayers and the prayers of Arkansans are with Corporal Wade's 
family, including his wife, Katie, his mom, Tami, and his dad Terence. 
I humbly offer my thanks to Corporal Wade, a true American hero, for 
his selfless service to the security and well-being of all Americans, 
and I ask my colleagues to keep his family in our thoughts and prayers 
during this very difficult time.
