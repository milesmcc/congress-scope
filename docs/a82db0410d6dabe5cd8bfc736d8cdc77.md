Mr. SESSIONS. According to ICE, the illegal immigrants work for 
different subcontractors who are not facing any charges from the 
Government. Unfortunately, that is not a new problem. In October of 
2005, seven illegal aliens were arrested for working at the U.S. Air 
Force base in Idaho. They were employed by a subcontractor.

Also, last October, 2006, three illegal workers were working at Fort 
Bragg and they were arrested.

In 2005 alone, ICE arrested 6 illegal aliens working at Homestead Air 
Reserve Base in Florida, 48 illegal aliens working at the Seymour 
Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, 9 illegal aliens performing 
contract work at a facility that refits Navy aircraft in North 
Carolina, 18 working for a San Diego company that performed maintenance 
on U.S. Navy vessels.

According to an Empire Journal article, a huge problem is that 
employers can participate in a voluntary program to verify employee 
work eligibility, but they suffer no penalty for failing to check the 
validity of the Social Security numbers.

The article concluded:




 A weak law allows the employer to see the document and if 


 the document looks genuine to the employer, the employer 


 cannot be held responsible for hiring the illegal immigrant.


It is astounding how widespread this problem is. In a report by ICE 
in 2005, a company contracted by the Navy to paint ships was found to 
employ 86 illegals who had security passes giving them access to the 
entire Navy base in San Diego.

In 2004, 41 suspected illegal aliens were apprehended while working 
for a Department of Defense contractor that was providing Boeing with 
anti-missile systems and radar--top security type equipment.

Also, in 2004, seven foreign nationals were arrested for working 
illegally at the Fort Polk Joint Readiness Training Center in 
Louisiana. They were ''role players'' in combat exercises to prepare 
soldiers for combat in Iraq.

In one alarming incident, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was 
caught allowing illegal aliens to obtain bogus documentation by using 
fake Social Security numbers to work as contract painters in nuclear 
facilities.

Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, stated:




 Commission regulations are supposed to ensure that 


 individuals who are able to access nuclear facilities are 


 subject to appropriate background and security checks but 


 they clearly did not work in this case.


This amendment would fix key weaknesses in the employer verification 
system, provide a defense to companies that follow the rules and act in 
good faith, and debar companies that violate the rule.

We will not tolerate that, with taxpayers' money on taxpayers' 
contracts.

We want to help people in this country get higher wages. I have 
talked about that for some time. We need to consider and take the 
advice, I believe, of Dr. Barry Chiswick, head of the Department of 
Economics at the University of Illinois in Chicago, when he testified 
before the Senate committee last spring. He said:




 The large increase in low-skilled immigration . . . has had 


 the effect of decreasing the wages and employment 


 opportunities of low-skilled workers who are currently 


 residing in the United States.



 Over the past two decades . . . [t]he real earnings of low-


 skilled workers has either stagnated or decreased somewhat.


This is Dr. Chiswick. He goes on to say:




 We . . . need to . . . provide greater assistance to low-


 skilled Americans in their quest for better jobs and higher 


 wages. [O]ne of the ways we can help them in this regard is 


 by reducing the very substantial competition they are facing 


 from this very large and uncontrolled low-skilled immigration 


 that is the result of both our legal immigration system and 


 the absence of enforcement of immigration law.


Professor Harry Holzer, Associate Dean and Professor of Public Policy 
at Georgetown, said this before the Judiciary Committee last spring. He 
believes American workers do want jobs currently held by illegal 
laborers and he believes that absent illegal immigrant competition, 
employers would raise wages and improve working conditions to attract 
American workers.

Absolutely that will happen. This is what the Associate Dean and 
Professor of Public Policy in Georgetown said:




 I believe that when immigrants are illegal, they do more to 


 undercut the wages of native born workers because the playing 


 field isn't level and the employers don't have to pay them 


 market wages . . . [T]here are jobs in industries like 


 construction I think are more appealing to native-born 


 workers and many native-born low-income men might be 


 interested in more of those jobs. . . . Absent the 


 immigrants, the employer might need to raise those wages and 


 improve those conditions of work to entice native-born 


 workers into those jobs.


As we consider this, let's also consider the relevance of unfair 
competition to low-skilled workers. Let's let their wages go up in this 
time of unprecedented prosperity and GDP growth and profits. Let's let 
the workers' salaries go up. One way to do that is eliminate this 
competition from large numbers of illegal workers.

I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.
