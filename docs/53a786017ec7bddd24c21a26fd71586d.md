Mr. REID. Mr. President, the prayer, having been led by Admiral 
Black, who spent his entire life counseling those in the military who 
had different issues, set the tone this morning for a moment of silence 
we are going to have.

One of the worst tragedies that has ever taken place on a military 
installation was at Fort Hood a couple of days ago. Thirteen are dead. 
We have a number seriously wounded. For the tens of thousands who are 
at that post and other installations around our country and around the 
world, certainly it is in keeping with our thoughts for those who have 
fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan, and certainly the demonstration that we 
saw with the first responders at Fort Hood and the tragedy that ensued 
there.

Our thoughts are with those who have been so badly injured in body 
and mind.

I now ask the Chair to announce a moment of silence.
