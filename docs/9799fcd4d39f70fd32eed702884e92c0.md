Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.

The gentleman talks about how we need to support General Petraeus. 
Let me quote from Thomas Friedman, who has had years of experience in 
understanding the Middle East. He said: I hope the Democrats under 
Speaker
Nancy Pelosi keep pushing to set a deadline for withdrawal 
from Iraq because they are providing two patriotic services that the 
Republicans failed to offer in the previous 4 years. The first is 
policy discipline. The other useful function Speaker Pelosi and her 
colleagues are performing is to give the President and General David 
Petraeus, our Commander in Iraq, the leverage of a deadline without a 
formal deadline. How so? The surge cannot work without political 
reconciliation among Iraqi factions, which means Sunni-Shiite 
negotiations, and such negotiations are unlikely to work without 
America having the leverage of telling the parties that if they do not 
compromise, we will leave. Deadlines matter. At some point Iraqis have 
to figure this out themselves. Since Mr. Bush refuses to set a 
deadline, Speaker Pelosi is the next best thing. Do not underestimate 
how useful it is for General Petraeus to be.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of time.
