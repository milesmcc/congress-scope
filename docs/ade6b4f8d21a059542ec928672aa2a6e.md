# H.R. 1234
## `ade6b4f8d21a059542ec928672aa2a6e`
`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 2 May 2007`

Mr. KUCINICH. The President's veto will stand, but now what will we 
stand for?

We say we want the war to end, but will we give the President the 
money to continue the war? We say we want our troops home, but will we 
continue to support the occupation? We know that U.S. contractors have 
been stealing from U.S. taxpayers and the Iraqi


government, but will we leave our troops in Iraq to protect them? We 
know oil has had a lot to do with this war, but will we let this 
President get away with attempting to privatize Iraq's oil wealth in 
the name of reconciliation?

We can still change course. We can deny the administration funds to 
continue the war. We can bring our troops home. We can stabilize Iraq 
with an international security force once we end the occupation. That 
is exactly what H.R. 1234 is about, and it is time that we started to 
look for alternatives which reflect this Nation's highest aspirations.
