Mr. KLEIN of Florida. And these are certainly the questions that our 
country is wrestling with right now, and as I turn it back over to Mr. 
Braley, I will just mention again that on the economy side of this 
thing, and I think about the people back home and what they're thinking 
about as they're looking towards the next election and just thinking 
about the next week's expenses. And one statistic jumped out at me when 
I was hearing about gas prices. Gas prices in the United States are 
about $3.39 per gallon, extraordinary, at a time when the oil companies 
are still going to be making historic profits.

The United States military is paying $3.23 a gallon in Iraq. That's 
$153 million per month. At the same time, Iraqis, when they can get 
gas, are paying $1.30 per gallon of gas. What is wrong with this 
picture? Our military is paying $3.23 to buy gas in Iraq on our dime, 
and Iraqis are getting it at $1.30.

So again, it's this question of as Americans, and being the great 
people that we are and trying to do what we can to help here and there, 
what can we do differently to help protect Americans deal with their 
daily lives and, at the same time, protect our country?
