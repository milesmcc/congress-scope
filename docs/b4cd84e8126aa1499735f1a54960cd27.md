`Mr. REID â€” 17 February 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republicans did not want to adjourn the 
other day because they wanted another chance to vote on Iraq. The 
majority of the Senate just voted on Iraq and the majority of the 
Senate is against the escalation in Iraq. We have had that other vote 
they have chosen, so now I ask the Senate to turn to the consideration 
of H. Con. Res. 67, the adjournment resolution, and that the Senate 
proceed to vote on passage of the resolution, with no intervening 
action or debate.
