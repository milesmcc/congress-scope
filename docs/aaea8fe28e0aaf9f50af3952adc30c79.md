Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add my voice to 
others who are calling for an end to the war in Iraq. We must end this 
war, and we must end it now. We cannot wait and we must not wait.

Every month, every week, every hour, every minute, every second, 
every moment another young man is killed, another young woman is 
killed, another young American is killed, their innocent blood is on 
all of our hands. We have a moral obligation to bring this madness to 
an end.

Nothing, but nothing good can come out of this war. It is destroying 
Iraq, and it is destroying the very soul of our Nation.

As Members of Congress, we must find a way to stop it and stop it 
now.
