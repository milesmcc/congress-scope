Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, the President's new plan is a plan for 
more door-to-door fighting, more civil war, more civilian casualties, 
more troop deaths, more wasted money, more destabilization in the 
region and more separation from the world community.

Does anyone in this administration have any sense at all? They are 
sending our troops into the middle of a civil war, setting the stage 
for a wider war.

The President is blaming Iran for attacks on Americans in Iraq; he is 
vowing to disrupt Iran. He is adding an aircraft carrier to the shores 
of Iran. He is promising to give Patriot missiles to our friends and 
allies. Isn't one war enough for this President?

Congress needs to challenge the position of the President, take 
necessary steps to bring our troops home. We need to begin talks with 
Iran and Syria, not blame them for our misguided war in Iraq. Diplomacy 
is the only way to avoid a widening war. If we follow this President's 
path of war, we will get more war.
