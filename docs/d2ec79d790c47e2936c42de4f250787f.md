Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to offer a warm welcome 
home to a soldier who sacrificed for his country and to thank all of 
those who are working to make his return home a successful one. Private 
First Class Andrew Parker enlisted in the United States Army after 
graduating from Lamoille Union High School in 2007. On November 20, 
2008, his MRAP vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb near Kandahar, 
Afghanistan. Andrew suffered injuries that left him paralyzed from the 
chest down.

During the months that Andrew spent recovering in DOD and VA 
hospitals, his neighbors and friends in Vermont worked together to 
complete an incredible project to modify his home to make it accessible 
to him upon his return. His kindergarten teacher, the Hyde Park VFW and 
countless other businesses, organizations and individuals donated time, 
money and labor to make it possible for Andrew to return home to a new 
addition to his home, a living room, a bedroom, a bath and a bay for 
his new van.

Now Andrew will have the resources he needs to focus on rebuilding 
his strength as he works to fulfill his new dream of becoming a 
teacher. He should know that all Vermonters and all Americans are with 
him in spirit as he continues on his courageous journey.
