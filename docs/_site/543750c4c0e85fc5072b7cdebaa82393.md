Ms. HERSETH SANDLIN. Madam Speaker, on October 30, 2009, I will be 
proud to host two of my constituents, Branden Stackenwalt and his 
father, Dave Stackenwalt, for a visit to the U.S. Capitol.

Branden is proud to be a combat engineer with the U.S. Army, serving 
with the 569th Mobility Augmentation Company, 4th Engineer Battalion. 
On September 21, 2009, the vehicle Branden was traveling in ran over a 
roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan. One member of the vehicle's 
four-man crew was killed and the other three, including Branden, were 
critically injured. In the blast, Branden suffered severe fractures to 
vertebrae in his back, both legs, elbow and heels.

Thanks to his enduring spirit and courageous determination--as well 
as the excellent medical care he received from our Nation's Army 
doctors--Branden is vastly improved today and on the road to recovery. 
He was first flown to Germany, and then to the Walter Reed Army Medical 
Center where he has received care since September 27.

Since the incident, Branden has undergone multiple surgeries to 
repair his legs. Although he still faces an arduous road to full 
recovery, he has made significant progress, all the while maintaining a 
positive attitude. I am quite certain that Branden's personal strength 
of spirit, along with the loving care of his family, has been 
instrumental in the progress he has made.

During his recovery, I have had the privilege to get to know both 
Branden and his family. His parents, Dave and Kim, are wonderful people 
who love their son very much. Branden also has a younger sister, 
Savannah, in South Dakota who I know is eager to see him again soon.

Branden is now able to get around well in a wheelchair, and I have 
learned that he will soon be transferred to the Minneapolis VA facility 
to continue his recovery. I am pleased that he was able to visit us at 
the Capitol.

Madam Speaker, it is with great pride and respect for one of South 
Dakota's brave young soldiers that I rise today in recognition of 
Branden Stackenwalt and his service to our country. I am so very proud 
to represent him, his family, and all South Dakotans who serve in our 
Nation's Armed Forces. I thank Branden and all those who serve for 
their courage and fortitude in the face of danger.
