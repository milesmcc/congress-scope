Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the American people are united in their 
desire to provide generously for the new generation of veterans, 
including those who have served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We 
want these veterans to have every opportunity to reintegrate 
successfully into civilian life, to find good jobs, and to build solid 
careers. To that end, the Federal Government has provided opportunities 
for these veterans to pursue advancement through higher education. That 
is why we passed the post-9/11 G.I. bill on June 30, 2008, and it is 
why we expanded existing education programs through the Department of 
Defense--DOD.

The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which I 
chair, has been conducting an in-depth inquiry into the for-profit 
sector of higher education. Most recently, we have taken a look at the 
unprecedented surge of dollars from military educational benefits 
programs to for-profits. I am here today to have printed in the Record 
a new report that committee staff has prepared titled, ''Benefitting 
Whom? For-Profit Education Companies and the Growth of Military 
Educational Benefits.'' This report documents that between 2006 and 
2010, combined Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense 
education benefits received just by 20 for-profit education companies 
increased from $66.6 million to $521.2 million, an increase of 683 
percent.

Mr. President, I will have more to say about the report in the 
upcoming days.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a report and an appendix 
be printed in the Record.
