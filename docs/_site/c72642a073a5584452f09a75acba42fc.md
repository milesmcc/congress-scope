Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, May 14 marks the 60th anniversary of 
Israel's independence. On behalf of the House Republican Israel Caucus, 
I rise today to honor the Jewish state for its significant achievements 
over the past six decades.

Israel has shared an important strategic relationship with our 
Nation. And today, our countries are working more closely than ever 
before to defeat the common threat of terrorism.

Research and development collaborations between our countries have 
produced security technologies that are now used to protect the lives 
of Americans, Israelis, and of people all over the world. In fact, 
Israeli equipment has saved the lives of hundreds of U.S. soldiers 
stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. And because of Israel's desert 
location, farmers and agricultural experts there have been forced to 
adapt their irrigation methods. This research now benefits dry weather 
areas around the world, all because Israel discovered a way to make the 
desert bloom.

Over the years, I have had the great fortune to travel to Israel four 
times, and each trip has been marked by emotional and spiritual 
moments. Anyone who has traveled to Israel feels a connection to the 
people and places there. This is because America shares a special bond 
with Israel. This bond will only become stronger in the next 60 years, 
and I am very humbled to begin this celebration.
