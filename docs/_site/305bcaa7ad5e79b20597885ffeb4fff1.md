Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week, General Jack 
Keane, a retired four-star general and former Vice Chief of Staff of 
the United States Army, urged the Armed Services Committee to ''find 
the courage that our troops display so openly, to deserve their 
honorable and selfless sacrifice, and to not squander their sacrifices 
and the gains they have made.''

General Keane reviewed that the counteroffensive led by General David 
Petraeus is reducing sectarian violence. Sunnis are rejecting al Qaeda, 
and more Iraqis are working with our troops.

Osama bin Laden has described Iraq, quote, ''The most important and 
serious issue today for the whole world is this third world war. It is 
raging in the land of the two rivers. The world's millstone and pillar 
is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate.''



We must have resolve to stop our enemies and support our brave troops 
who are fighting to defend our freedom and protect American families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
