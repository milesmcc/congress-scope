# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `cd465bc5294fe75bb5cafe31f325196f`
`Mr. BOCCIERI â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. BOCCIERI. This means that the Afghan Government needs to be fully 
functional, standing on its own with an army and police force capable 
of defending the country, and sealing the border with Pakistan; an 
economy that provides its citizens with an acceptable standard of 
living; and a reliable government and judicial structure that delivers 
critical services and enforces a uniform rule of law throughout the 
country.

Afghanistan needs civilian investments, comparable if not bigger than 
our military investment. While securing Afghanistan is important to our 
national security, our troops cannot do it alone.

It has been said that we need a foreign policy based on realism 
rather than idealism, and I concur with that. That's why I will not be 
supporting this resolution today. While I do support the gentleman's 
efforts to have this discussion, we need to take a very long-term 
strategy and find out how we do bring our troops home safely, 
honorably, and soon.
