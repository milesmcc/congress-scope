Mr. KUCINICH. The administration sets several benchmarks for the 
Iraqi Government, including the passage of the hydrocarbon law by the 
parliament. The administration misled this Congress by emphasizing only 
a small part of this law, the so-called ''fair'' distribution of oil 
revenues.

Consider the fact that the Iraqi hydrocarbon law contains a mere 
three sentences that generally discuss the ''fair'' distribution of 
oil. Except for these three scant lines, the entire 33-page hydrocarbon 
bill is about creating a complex legal structure to facilitate the 
privatization of Iraqi oil. As a matter of fact, yesterday, Vice 
President Cheney was in Baghdad specifically to tell the Iraqi 
legislature they must stay in session to pass this hydrocarbon bill 
which hands Iraqi oil over to foreign oil companies.

It is imperative that all of us look at this carefully before we cast 
our vote today.

Mr. Speaker, this war will never end if the Iraqi people believe the 
U.S. government is trying to deliver its oil over to U.S. oil 
companies.
