Mr. DONNELLY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the sacrifice of 
Private David Neil Simmons of Kokomo, Indiana, who was killed in an 
ambush on April 8, 2007, while serving his Nation in Baghdad, Iraq. 
Neil risked everything in service to America, and for that we are 
eternally grateful. -

Neil was the kind of kid whom everyone loved. With his big smile and 
enthusiasm, he made life more enjoyable for everyone around him. As 
someone who deeply loved his family and knew what it meant to be a 
great friend, he also made life better for those around him.

Neil was also a grateful person, returning to his high school to 
visit friends and thank teachers and mentors for their impact on his 
life. During one of these visits, just a couple weeks before he was set 
to deploy to Iraq, he ran into Janet Lovelace, a secretary at 
Northwestern High School. When Janet gave Neil a hug and thanked him 
for his service, he became teary-eyed. Today, on behalf of this entire 
nation, I would also like us to stop and give thanks to Neil for his 
service.

Upon hearing about his son's death, David Simmons said, ''Freedom is 
very expensive. You don't know how much until something like this 
happens. My heart goes out to all the families that have to go through 
this.'' In the midst of so much sorrow, to remember other families is 
truly remarkable.

I have been privileged to speak several times with Neil's mother, 
Teri Tenbrook, over the past few weeks. Her courage and resolve in so 
tragic a time are impressive. The simple truth is that the true price 
of war is paid by soldiers and their families. Today I honor Neil 
Simmons, and I honor his family.

Neil's ultimate sacrifice puts him in the solemn and revered company 
of patriots who have given their lives in service to their country. My 
humble thanks to Neil and to his family. His name will live as long as 
this Nation lives.

May God grant peace to those who mourn and strength to those who 
continue to fight. And may God be with all of us, as I know he is with 
Neil.
