Mr. ALEXANDER. Not long ago, the State of Tennessee was one of two 
winners in the race to the top in education funding. I was very proud 
of the State. This was not my doing. This was their doing--the 
teachers, the Governor, and the legislature. Both parties worked hard. 
I came to the Senate floor last week and praised President Obama and 
his Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, for their courage and vision 
on their K-12 education agenda, pushing for the holy grail of 
education, which is finding ways to award outstanding teaching and 
tying it to students' effectiveness and charter schools and higher 
standards, even common standards, and the race to the top itself, in 
terms of encouraging excellence. These are not easy things to do.

President Obama is not the first Democrat, or even the first 
Democratic President, who has pushed these changes. But he is the first 
President of either party who may have a chance to actually get them 
done. It may just be easier for a Democratic President to do this than 
a Republican President. When he does these things, it is important for 
Republican Senators to give him credit for it. I genuinely do.

Mr. President, it does not help for us now to come along and say, OK, 
we are going to make it harder to be the Governor of Tennessee and 
Virginia and Michigan and California and all these States because we 
are going to give them money, with more strings attached, and say when 
they take the money and spend it, they have to keep the same level of 
spending they had before. Just as Governor Ravitch says, it stops 
States from doing what they already need to do.

Mr. President, I wish every State had done what Tennessee has done. 
We have a Democratic Governor, Phil Bredesen, who is completing his 
time.


This is what he said in his State address in 2009:




 Please let me make it clear that no proposed version of the 


 stimulus is any panacea or silver bullet; substantial cuts 


 are still needed under any circumstances.


He meant in the State budget.




 Furthermore, it is vital to remember that this stimulus 


 money is one-time funds.


The Governor is saying we are going to have to cut the budget. In 
fact, our State has little debt. It has among the lowest taxes in the 
country. It has a solid pension fund that has survived this as well as 
anybody. But when we say to any Governor that here is some money, and 
here are some rules to keep you from doing what you need to do, I think 
we are doing no service there.

I wanted to say that before we have this vote today, and to say that 
there are four or five reasons I hope we don't go forward with it. The 
first reason, both in terms of education and Medicaid, is it ties the 
Governors' hands to keep them from doing what they should be doing. The 
next reason is there is $10 billion in permanent taxes on multinational 
corporations which will make it more likely that American jobs would go 
overseas. Another reason is there is $3 billion in spending cuts in 
defense that likely could come out of the operation and maintenance 
budget of soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The next reason is 
it adds to the debt $5 billion at a time when we don't have the money 
any more than the States do. We are spending 41 cents out of every 
dollar, which is borrowed.

Mr. President, I am going to oppose this measure this afternoon. I 
will support efforts to rein in spending, to give States more freedom 
to do what they need to do, to try to create a more limited government, 
to try to create less debt, and to try to create an economy that can 
focus its attention for the foreseeable future on a progrowth 
environment that creates jobs in the private sector, which is the real 
challenge for our country today.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
