Mr. PERLMUTTER. If I could jump in here, I mean what was happening 
under the prior Congress and under this President, President Bush, is a 
classic borrow and spend, borrow and spend. There was no limitation on 
what you would buy or what you'd spend, but you'd cut taxes and you'd 
prosecute a war that's cost us, by the end of 2008, $750 billion. The 
budget of Colorado is about $15 billion for a year. We'll have spent 
$750 billion in Iraq by the end of 2008. Right now we're at about $550 
billion.
