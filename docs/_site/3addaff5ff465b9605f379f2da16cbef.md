Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I couldn't agree with you more in your 
explanation of what we are up against; but it strikes me the 
differences we hear on the floor of this House. This evening some of 
our colleagues were saying we have to get out of Iraq now. We have to 
end the war. If we bring our troops tomorrow, say they, we will end 
this war. And presumably, then, everything will be fine. And that 
simply doesn't track with the history that the gentleman is describing. 
It does not describe the enemy that was willing to hijack planes and 
fly them into buildings and kill women and children. Every day we see 
the stories in Baghdad of people blowing up women and children. Our 
just bringing our troops home doesn't, wouldn't, couldn't, signal the 
end of this war and of the determination of that enemy. It strikes me 
the difference that we see in this body.
