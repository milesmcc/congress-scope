# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `8593696099b9295a5ce4271213406563`
`Mr. STEARNS â€” 14 February 2007`

---


Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. 
What this debate is really all about is whether you wish to make a 
statement in support of our new strategy in Iraq or whether you oppose 
this new plan.

By simply supporting this resolution, you are saying you want to 
leave Iraq as soon as possible. I am not willing to do this. I am 
willing to support the administration and to give our military and our 
troops the benefit of the doubt, and I will vote against this 
resolution because I want to give this new strategy a chance, a simple 
chance to succeed.

My colleagues, let me repeat. If you vote for this resolution, then 
you are saying you do not wish to give the military and General 
Petraeus a chance to succeed. In fact, this resolution declares the new 
strategy in Iraq is a failure before it has even had a chance to be 
implemented.

This is inconsistent with the unanimous vote the Senate gave to the 
man selected to carry out this strategy, General Petraeus. Everyone 
agrees he is the best man. This resolution is undercutting the general 
and our troops at the very time they need our support.

Now, many will argue that there has been ample opportunity to succeed 
and that we have failed at this point. Certainly mistakes have been 
made and a change of strategy is long overdue. However, what should 
this strategy be? Should the U.S. immediately pull out of Iraq, leaving 
the terrorists emboldened and potentially put more Americans at risk?

The advocates for this resolution have no answer. In fact, they beg 
the very question, What happens when we leave? What happens in Iraq if 
we leave precipitously? And what do we do if it turns into a Middle 
East conflagration?

If Shiite Iran succeeds in exerting its influence through Shiite 
Iraq, it will threaten to spill over the sectarian violence across the 
Middle East and elsewhere. Now here is how the head of the Arab League 
views this potential conflict. This is what he said. ''If this happens 
we will enter hell itself.''

The supporters of the resolution keep talking about the past, but 
they do not talk about the future and how we are going to solve this 
problem without creating a more serious problem.

Edmund Burke, the great conservative leader from Britain, this is how 
he put it: It is not a question of how we got into this situation, but 
how do we get out. They have no answers, and by not answering this 
latter question they are begging the question.

Now, this is circular reasoning. It is one in which a premise 
presupposes the conclusion in some way. In a course of logic, this is 
called the core relative. So this resolution is faulty reasoning.



Any professor of logic would simply recognize the false choice. We 
need this new strategy that General Petraeus is implementing so that we 
can hand over this country to the constitutionally elected government. 
My colleagues, this can be done and will be done soon one way or the 
other.



Any new strategy must be accompanied by a set of strategic benchmarks 
designed to measure progress in Iraq and to hold the administration and 
the Iraqi Government accountable for their role in achieving this 
success.

Mr. Speaker, I ask to include in the Record a list of these 
benchmarks that I recommend be part of this new strategy to allow our 
troops to come home.

Why not consider a resolution that incorporates these benchmarks?

But I do offer a warning to the administration. We must have 
benchmarks that demonstrate our progress in Iraq. I, for one, and many 
others, cannot support continued funding without measurable benchmarks. 
And we need to know if we are making progress; and if we are not, then 
we can employ other tactics and different measures, all of which will 
lead to the Iraqi Government taking on the responsibility for their own 
country.

My colleagues, the political easy thing to do is to vote for this 
faulty resolution because you are not willing to give a final chance 
for success and you have no ideas on achieving success. The harder, 
political vote is ''no,'' and that is what I intend to do.

If I have a few more moments, I just want to bring to my colleagues' 
attention a quote that has been declassified from bin Laden's deputy. 
And if you will bear with me and follow this quote. ''It is my humble 
opinion that the jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals: The 
first stage, expel the Americans from Iraq; the second stage, establish 
Islamic authority, and then develop it and support it until it achieves 
the level of a caliphate; the third stage, extend the jihad wave to the 
secular countries neighboring Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Iran; the fourth 
stage, it may coincide with what came before, the clash with Israel 
because Israel was established only to challenge a new Islamic 
entity.''

My colleagues, that is what is at stake. The war in Iraq is a central 
front in the global war on terrorism and a central battleground for 
Islamic militant extremists in this worldwide mission to simply destroy 
all Western democracy. And you don't have to take my word for it. You 
can see this declassified deputy to bin Laden, his opinion.

Mr. Speaker, I will vote against this resolution. While no proposal 
guarantees success, a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. support would 
guarantee failure. The stakes are too high to fail in Iraq. It remains 
in America's strategic interests to ensure regional stability in the 
Middle East and to deny terrorists a safe haven in Iraq.

Certainly mistakes have been made and a change of strategy is long 
overdue. However, what should this change of strategy be? Should the 
U.S. immediately pull out of Iraq, leave the terrorists emboldened and 
potentially put more Americans at risk? Or do we need a new strategy to 
win the war and finish the job? I think the latter.

Instead of a politically motivated resolution, my colleagues and I 
have developed a strategy for victory in Iraq. We need to establish 
measurable benchmarks for success in Iraq while expressing unwavering 
support for our troops.

Any new strategy must be accompanied by a set of strategic benchmarks 
designed to measure progress in Iraq and to hold the Bush 
administration and the Iraqi Government accountable for their role in 
achieving success. Threatening to reduce the future commitment of 
American troops and economic aid if they are not implemented, we must 
enforce these benchmarks. It is important to stress that an open-ended 
American military commitment is both unwise and dangerous. In the 
business world, no successful enterprise gives enormous sums of money 
without accountability, and nor should we.

The military benchmarks I would like to see utilized include:

Measuring the level of Iraqi government cooperation with the U.S. 
Military;

Iraqi progress in removing terrorists and others from its own 
security forces;

Identifying the level of combat experience for all Iraqi Army 
battalions; and

Tracking the expenditure of funds supporting Iraqi defense forces.

The political benchmarks include:

Advancing a strategy to promote tolerance and co-existence among 
Iraqis;

Providing fair access to all Iraqi resources;

Promoting the rule of law;

Reforming the judicial system to ensure equal application of the law; 
and

Measuring cooperation and coordination of neighboring countries in 
stabilizing Iraq.

Why not consider a resolution that incorporates these benchmarks?

This resolution sends an inappropriate message to our troops. This 
resolution declares the new strategy in Iraq a failure before it even 
has the chance to be implemented. This is inconsistent with the 
unanimous vote the other body gave to the man designated to carry the 
strategy out, General Petraeus. Congress is undercutting General 
Petraeus and our troops at the very time they need our support.

As cochair of the Congressional Air Force Caucus, I joined in leading 
a delegation of members to Iraq. This trip provided valuable insight 
into our operations and conditions on the ground. The situation in Iraq 
poses multiple problems--Sunni al Qaeda terrorists, committed Baathists 
who are largely Sunni, Shiite militias, and Shiite interference from 
Iran. This is truly an unholy brew.

The war in Iraq is a central front in the global war on terrorism and 
a central battleground for Islamist militant extremists in their 
worldwide mission to destroy democracy. But don't take my word for it. 
Take the words from a declassified letter from bin Laden's deputy Ayman 
al-Zawahiri.




 It is my humble opinion that the Jihad in Iraq requires 


 several incremental goals: The first stage: Expel the 


 Americans from Iraq. The second stage: Establish an Islamic 


 authority . . . then develop it and support it until it 


 achieves the level of a caliphate . . . The third stage: 


 Extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring 


 Iraq. The fourth stage: It may coincide with what came 


 before: the clash with Israel, because Israel was established 


 only to challenge any new Islamic entity.


These Islamic extremists view victory in Iraq as paramount to their 
establishment of a worldwide Islamic kingdom. Here is what Osama bin 
Laden has to say about Iraq from a 2006 audiotape--''The epicenter of 
these wars is Baghdad, the seat of the caliphate rule. Their defeat in 
Iraq will mean defeat in all their wars and a beginning to the receding 
of their Zionist-Crusader tide against us.''

Sectarian violence rages in Iraq, fanned by Iran and Syria, and this 
could well spill over throughout the region. Look at these charts. They 
show the sectarian divide in Iraq among Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds; and 
the other shows the regional divide between Sunnis and Shiites.

If Shiite Iran succeeds in exerting its influence through Shiite 
Iraq, it will threaten the spillover of sectarian violence throughout 
the Middle East and elsewhere. Here is how Amr Mousa, head of the Arab 
League, views this potential Iranian-backed Shiite conflict with the 
Sunni nations--''We will enter hell itself.''

The Islamist terrorist threat is real and directly connected to 
defeating the insurgents in Iraq. Democrat plans to abandon Iraq will 
not make this threat disappear.

America cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past by 
withdrawing from a direct confrontation with radical Islamist 
terrorists. They will continue to intensify their attacks against 
America, just as they did following other attacks such as in:


1979: 66 American diplomats taken hostage and held in Iran for 444 
days.

1983: A truck bomb kills 241 marines at their barracks in Beirut.

1988: Pan Am 103 bombing kills 270, including 189 Americans, over 
Lockerbie, Scotland.

1993: Six killed in first World Trade Center bombing by militant 
Islamic terrorists.

1996: 19 U.S. service members are killed in Khobar Towers bombing.

1998: 225 people killed in bombings at the U.S. embassies in Tanzania 
and Kenya.

2000: Al Qaeda's attack on the destroyer USS. Cole kills 17 American 
sailors.

2001: Al Qaeda hijackers fly planes into the World Trade Center and 
the Pentagon, while passengers force a fourth to crash in Pennsylvania. 
Total number killed: 2,973.

It is vital that we succeed in Iraq for these reasons: A stable Iraq 
dedicated to the rule of law will weaken extremism in the Middle East; 
we cannot allow terrorists to gain a safe haven in that nation; and 
curbing Iran's regional ambitions.

But I do offer a warning. We must have benchmarks that demonstrate 
our progress in Iraq. I for one cannot support continued funding 
without measurable benchmarks and we need to know if we are making 
progress. If we are not, then we can take other tactics and different 
measures. All of which will lead to the Iraqi Government taking on the 
responsibility for their own country.

In conclusion Mr. Speaker, one thing is for certain: The men and 
women fighting in Iraq must never be used as a political tool. They 
deserve our unmitigated support. They do not deserve political 
posturing. We must continue to provide the troops with the support they 
need to be safe and successful. I urge all my colleagues to oppose this 
resolution and seek a real resolution that includes military, 
political, and social benchmarks for success.
