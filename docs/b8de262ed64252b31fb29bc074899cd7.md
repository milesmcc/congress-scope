# FY 2007 SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
## `b8de262ed64252b31fb29bc074899cd7`
`Mr. HERGER â€” 22 March 2007`

Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the FY 2007 
supplemental measure as currently written. It would place dangerous 
constraints on our mission and our war on terrorism in Iraq by 
empowering our Congress to overrule our Nation's top generals, who best 
understand the challenges there. Our Iraq policy should be based on the 
recommendation of General Petraeus, not the commands of armchair 
generals in Congress. Our Nation's mission in Iraq is too important to 
fall victim to the dangerous congressional micromanagement.

Iraq is a central front in a war against the radical jihadists. The 
outcome of this mission will greatly impact our national security for 
decades to come. For this reason, this body should pass a supplemental 
bill that fully funds our troops, without tying the hands of our 
military commanders.

Vote ''no'' on this supplemental.
