Mr. KINGSTON. Well, let's just say the global warming campaign has 
been a great disappointment except for the Vice President's 
pocketbooks. He's done real well on this financially.

But, you know, you think about the government efficiency. Think about 
Katrina. What was that, $120 billion to rebuild New Orleans? I would 
think Democrats and Republicans share the blame. Government did not do 
a very good job.

Think about the war in Afghanistan, now going into its eighth year. 
We have not executed the war very well.

Think about Social Security. It's going broke. I look at my 24-year-
old son and your children. They are not going to get it. That's a 
mathematical reality. That's not political spin. It runs out of money 
in 2030, period. Now, we could tinker around the edges and postpone 
that maybe a year or two, but it needs working.
