Mrs. BLACKBURN. Well, here we go again.

Instead of getting down to business and tending to the people's 
business, the majority wants to play a political game. So to do it, 
they are going to tie temporary funds for our men and women serving in 
Iraq and Afghanistan to a timetable for withdrawal. No amendments can 
be offered. Once again, the leadership of the House is set to embark on 
a legislative gamble to force the hand of U.S. military leadership. 
This is their 41st Iraq vote.

But the suspense comes. Will the Houses of Congress, the President, 
and the American people take their bluff? I think it is very highly 
unlikely.

The Democrat leadership seems content to write legislation that they 
know is going to fail. Now, why would you write something you know is 
going to fail?

Let's get past this. Let's give up the games. Let's take care of the 
people's business. Let's pass clean legislation to ensure the safety of 
our troops.
