Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from California (Mr. 
Cardoza) for bringing this important matter to the attention of the 
committee. This type of government-sponsored terrorism was a hallmark 
of Saddam Hussein's rule and cannot continue. It was endemic. 
Unfortunately, it seems that the practice continues, and I continue to 
worry that our assistance may not be benefiting the intended 
recipients.

I too am concerned about the plight of the Christian minority, and I 
am dedicated to using whatever tools we have available to ensure their 
rights are given due consideration.

Furthermore, I want to note for my colleagues that the recent 
supplemental included a requirement for a report on the ethnic and 
geographic distribution of the United States assistance programs 
reaching the Nineveh Plain region, which should give us a clearer 
picture of the situation facing Iraqi Christians.

I want to assure my friend that I, and I know my ranking member, who 
cares passionately about these issues, will work closely with the 
Congressman to ensure that this $10 million does go for its intended 
purpose of protecting the Christian minority in Iraq.
