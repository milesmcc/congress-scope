Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, there are many issues that face America that 
are of great importance, from the Iraq War to global warming. These 
global issues must be dealt with, but we have lacked the leadership in 
this administration to make the world proud of America and see us as a 
leader on such issues.

On Wednesday, this House will vote on an embryonic stem cell research 
bill sent from the Senate which the President has threatened to veto. I 
don't think there is a more important bill that this House could pass 
and send to the President and for the President to sign than embryonic 
stem cell research.

Mr. Speaker, if you or anybody in your family has Parkinson's 
disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, cancer, stroke, 
burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, 
you could have relief and possibly a cure for that illness because of 
embryonic stem cell research. America could reestablish itself as a 
country that has the best scientific research and provides the world 
with hope for cures for these catastrophic illnesses.

Last night in the Republican debate, one of the candidates said we 
need to find a cure for cancer. He's right, and the way to do it is 
through embryonic stem cell research. I urge this House to pass the 
bill, and I urge the President to have the courage to do the right 
thing and be pro-life and extend life for people on this planet.
