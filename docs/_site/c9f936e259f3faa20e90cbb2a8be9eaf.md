Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time 
as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1086 recognizing 
today, May 6, through May 12 as National Nurses Week. As a cosponsor of 
this resolution, I am proud to lend my voice in support of our Nation's 
nurses.

Continuing in the illustrious tradition of Florence Nightingale, the 
founder of modern nursing, nurses today continue to attend to our Armed 
Forces overseas. These brave men and women place themselves at risk in 
war zones, including the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, to tend to 
our injured soldiers. Besides tending to the wounded abroad, nurses are 
also on the front lines of our health care system here at home. Whether 
their primary function is to care for our aging population or to 
provide immediate aid to the sick and injured, our nurses provide 
quality patient care and support to keep our health care system 
running.

As the Nation continues to face a nursing shortage, with a projected 
1 million new nurses needed by 2016, it is especially important that 
everyone is aware of the sacrifices nurses make on a daily basis for 
our country. We must continue to encourage more young people and those 
seeking a change in career to join the nursing profession.

The resolution before us encourages all Americans to observe this 
week as National Nurses Week by showing appropriate recognition to 
nurses and creating programs and activities during the week to 
demonstrate the importance of nurses.



I would like to thank my colleagues and former nurses, Congresswoman 
Eddie Bernice Johnson, Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, and 
Congresswoman Lois Capps, for their leadership on this measure. Again, 
I reiterate, they are former nurses, although I don't know if you are 
ever a former nurse. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
join me in support of the resolution and its adoption.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
