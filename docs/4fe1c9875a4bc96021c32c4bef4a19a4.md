Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam Speaker, consistent with House Republican Earmark 
Standards, I am submitting the following earmark disclosure and 
certification information for one additional project funding request 
that I made and was included within the text of H.R. 3326, the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010.

Project: Ground Warfare Acoustical Combat Systems of Netted Sensors

Project Amount: $5,000,000

Account: RDTE--Navy

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: GWACS Defense, Inc.

Address of Requesting Entity: Suite 191, 4500 South, 129th East Ave., 
Tulsa, OK 74134

Description of Request: Combat systems are required that can detect, 
locate, discriminate and give precision targeting data of hostile fire 
to blue forces in a netcentric environment. Additionally, multi sensor 
systems are required that can help IFF, create total battlespace 
situational awareness both in open and urban terrain, and provide 
precision targeting data for combined and integrated fire support. 
Funds will be used to accelerate the completion of a new technology 
that is critical and urgently needed for small arms detection and 
location for future procurement for force protection and situational 
awareness at all command levels in open and urban terrain operations in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.
