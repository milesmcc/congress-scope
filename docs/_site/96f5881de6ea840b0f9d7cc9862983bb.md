Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The President has to deal with Congress now, and 
what is in this bill I think holds the President accountable. This bill 
does not just hold the Iraqis accountable, but it holds the President 
accountable.

The benchmarks that are in this supplement that we are going to pass 
are the President's benchmarks that he outlined in January that we need 
to hit. Now, if we do not hit them, then what do we do? The President 
says, do not tie my hands. We are saying, these are your benchmarks. We 
have been there for a long time, and if they do not step up, the Iraqi 
troops do not step up, it is time for us to go.

The bottom line is that there is no incentive for the Iraqis to step 
up because at this point they feel like we will stay there forever, and 
we are saying that we are not going to be there forever; get your act 
together.
