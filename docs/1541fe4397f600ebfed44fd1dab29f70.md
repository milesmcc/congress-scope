Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
3988, which names the postal facility in Fort Worth, Texas, after 
Master Sergeant Kenneth N. Mack.

H.R. 3988, which was introduced by Representative Kay Granger of 
Texas on October 29, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on 
December 12, 2007, by voice vote. This measure, which has been 
cosponsored by 31 Members, has the support of the entire Texas 
congressional delegation.

Master Sergeant Mack was both a U.S. Marine and a postal employee for 
over 20 years before being killed in Iraq on February 5 during combat 
operations.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague and to urge the 
swift passage of this bill.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
