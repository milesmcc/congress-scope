# PAKISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `b37c2c06f2ef3adc964ff91c0c8ff390`
`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 27 July 2010`

Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentlelady, for whom I have the greatest 
respect, for her concerns about the resolution. But I would like to 
respectfully suggest to her that the danger that's presented here is 
that this Congress ignores the WikiLeaks documents that point out a 
connection between Pakistani intelligence and the Afghanistan Taliban 
where they're actually helping the Taliban against our troops. We have 
to pay attention to that. I didn't create this resolution in order to 
link it with the Afghanistan war, but the Pakistan intelligence has 
created the link with the Afghanistan war because they are actually 
helping the Taliban. They created the link.

I yield 1 minute to the gentlelady from California (Ms. Woolsey), who 
has been a strong advocate for peace in this Congress.
