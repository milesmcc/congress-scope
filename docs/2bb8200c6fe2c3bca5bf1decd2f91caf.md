# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I support the supplemental funding bill that 
is before the House today, and urge my colleagues to join me in voting 
for it.

A lot has changed since the last time Congress debated funding for 
the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan eleven months 
ago. Earlier this year, President Obama stated that we will begin to 
draw down our forces in Iraq and complete the removal of combat troops 
by August 2010. Further, the President has also announced a new 
strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plan acknowledges our 
national interest in combating terrorism and the Taliban in Pakistan 
and Afghanistan and the need for stability in the region, especially 
with regard to safeguarding Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. At the same 
time, the President's plan correctly recognizes that we need a 
comprehensive strategy that does not rely on U.S. military force alone.

The President's plan therefore calls for increased resources to build 
schools, roads and hospitals, and strengthen democratic institutions 
and the rule of law in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. The strategy also 
calls for greater dialogue, intelligence sharing, and border 
cooperation between the U.S., Afghanistan and Pakistan. The challenges 
before us are formidable, but I think we need to give President Obama's 
strategy a chance to work. This bill begins the effort by providing 
funding for the training of Afghan and Pakistani security forces as 
well as funds for economic development, strengthening governance, 
expanding the rule of law, and boosting our diplomatic efforts in the 
region.

One thing that hasn't changed is the imperative to provide our troops 
in the field with the equipment and support they need to protect 
themselves and accomplish their mission.

I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important bill.
