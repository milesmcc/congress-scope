Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Stearns is, indeed, my friend, and we 
are classmates.

Madam Speaker, he conveniently left out those 4 years when Bill 
Clinton left a balanced budget to America, when the deficits were 
eliminated and when the debt was coming down. That's the key 
consideration here as we begin this debate. Indeed, this is about 
paying for our veterans' hospitals, paying for the war in Iraq, paying 
for the war in Afghanistan, and making sure that those Social Security 
checks get out on January 1.
