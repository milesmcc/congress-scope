`Mr. RODRIGUEZ â€” 12 March 2008`

Mr. RODRIGUEZ. I want to personally thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your 
leadership throughout the country and your efforts in providing for our 
veterans.

I know I had the pleasure of serving on the Veterans Committee, and 
nothing was more frustrating than during the period of time that I 
served to just give nothing but lip service, and at the same time see 
the major cuts of the administration when it came to our veterans after 
having served our country. When I saw the budgets of the administration 
continuously bring forth additional fees and copayments on our veterans 
when both sides were saying that that was not appropriate, he continues 
to do that with this present budget. And if that was not enough, I know 
that he cut priority 8 veterans. And I'm glad to see that this budget 
includes that on there, so I want to personally thank you for that.

In addition, the Democratic budget calls for advance pay and benefits 
to improve the quality of life of our troops and their families, 
including the emphasis on providing support and assistance to our 
troops and their families while they are deployed. And that is 
essential. It's unfortunate, and we cannot even comprehend how this has 
come about.

Let me just say, this budget also calls for a $15.9 billion cut for 
the next 5 years on our soldiers, on TRICARE. As it is, the 
reimbursements on TRICARE are real low, to the point that some of our 
doctors are not going to take some of those soldiers and provide access 
to health care that they need.

But I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairman and the 
leadership on this budget effort for making sure that our troops have 
the resources that are necessary, and to make sure that our veterans, 
after they come back, have the services that they're entitled to. We 
need to push forth on making sure those polytrauma centers get built so 
that access to health care is essential.

Thank you very much for this colloquy.

Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this Budget resolution. 
This budget provides for among many other elements the much needed 
resources for our country's defense needs.

As you know, I represent a very large district that spans from San 
Antonio in the east to El Paso County in the west and south to the 
Mexico border. The U.S. military is very important to my district as 
evidenced by the BRAC decisions that centralize military medical 
training in San Antonio and bring soldiers from Europe back to Fort 
Bliss in El Paso. While the defense budget is important to the Nation 
as a whole, it has a particularly strong significance to my 
constituents.











excellent and affordable healthcare


San Antonio is poised to be the military center of excellence for 
medical issues with the completion of the current BRAC construction.

The President's budget calls for increases in Tri-care fees for 
military retirees under the age of 65 by $15.9 billion over five years.

The military's own have opposed these fees as evidenced by the 
Military Offices' Association of America's rejection of the fee 
increases.

MOAA supports the Democratic budget that avoids Tri-care fee hikes 
and places a continued emphasis on addressing problems such as those 
identified at Walter Reed Medical Center.

















 readiness


The Commission on the Guard and Reserve issued a report on January 
30, 2008 citing a lack of readiness to respond to a catastrophic attack 
on the United States.

A major reason for this is the Administration budget that continually 
prioritizes funding wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while leaving the 
defense of our homeland at risk.

The Democratic Budget provides greater attention to improving 
military readiness, in particular for the National Guard and Reserve.









 additional pay and benefits to the troops


The Democratic Budget calls for advanced pay and benefits to improve 
the quality of life of the troops and their families, including an 
emphasis on providing support and assistance to troops and their 
families while they are deployed and when they return from deployments 
to readjust to civilian life.

This is what we owe the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines who 
have so selflessly fought for our Nation's freedom.
