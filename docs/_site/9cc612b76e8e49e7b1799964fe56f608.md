Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the 3rd Infantry Division at 
Fort Stewart, Georgia, underwent a change of command. As a member of 
the Armed Services Committee whose State is home to Fort Stewart, I 
rise today to thank Major General Rick Lynch on a job well done as he 
moves on to Fort Hood, Texas, and to congratulate Major General Tony 
Cucolo as he takes command of the 3rd ID.

This is a command of monumental importance in the United States Army, 
Mr. Speaker. The 3rd Infantry Division has one of the most successful 
combat records of any United States Army division. It was the first 
conventional U.S. unit to enter Baghdad in 2003 and the first division 
to actually serve three tours in Iraq.

Major General Lynch commanded the division on this most recent tour 
in Iraq, during which time we saw undeniable progress. Major General 
Cucolo has large boots to fill. But I have every confidence that he is 
the right man for the job.

Having served as brigade commander at Fort Stewart from 1999 to 2001, 
he is returning to familiar turf. He returns to Fort Stewart from the 
Pentagon, where he served as the Army's chief of public affairs for the 
past 2 years.

Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me, and all of our colleagues, in 
honoring these two fine soldiers for their service to our Nation.
