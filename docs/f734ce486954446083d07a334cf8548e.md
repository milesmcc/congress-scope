Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I voted against the Iraq war resolution, 
the PATRIOT Act, the FISA Act amendments; and I led the opposition to 
the bankruptcy bill just a few years ago, in each case because I 
thought we were being railroaded into unwise actions through the use of 
fear tactics. But I do not believe that to be the case now. Now we face 
a very real crisis.

The credit markets are shutting down. People will not be able to get 
car loans, loans for store inventories. There will be thousands of bank 
failures, millions of job losses. I believe we stand now literally on 
the brink of the abyss, and that we haven't seen such a situation since 
1931.

This is in many ways a weak bill. There should have been far more 
help for people facing foreclosures. There should have been bankruptcy 
reforms. There should have been real revenues to pay for it. There 
should have been a real stimulus to the economy. But this is the only 
bill that could be agreed upon now.

We are not sure this bill will solve the crisis, but it might. It 
will buy us time for a better solution. As between a certainty of 
catastrophe and a possibility of averting that catastrophe, I will vote 
for the possibility of averting the catastrophe. I urge everyone else 
to do so.
