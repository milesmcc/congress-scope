`Mr. BINGAMAN â€” 17 December 2010`

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support 
of the DREAM Act.

The DREAM Act provides individuals who were brought to the United 
States as young children, at the age of 15 or younger, with the 
opportunity to legalize their status if they work hard, stay out of 
trouble, graduate high school, and eventually go to college or enlist 
in the Armed Forces.

Passage of the DREAM Act is the right course of action for a variety 
of economic and humanitarian reasons. But it also makes sense in terms 
of strengthening our military's ability to attract talented recruits.

For almost a decade now our Nation's military forces have been 
deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. We rely on the courage, commitment, 
and dedication of an all volunteer force to fill the ranks of the 
military services. With the stress and hardship of repeated deployments 
and wartime service, the military has often struggled to maintain 
appropriate recruitment levels and standards.

According to the Department of Defense, enacting the DREAM Act would 
help address this issue. The fiscal year


2010-2020 Strategic Plan for the Defense Department provides that 
passage of the DREAM Act would help ensure we maintain a mission-ready 
all volunteer force. As explained by then Under Secretary of Defense 
David Chu in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee:



 many of these young people may wish to join the military, and 


 have the attributes needed--education, aptitude, fitness, and 


 moral qualifications. . . . the DREAM Act would provide these 


 young people the opportunity of serving the United States in 


 uniform.


We need to face the reality that we have individuals living in this 
country who were brought here unlawfully, but at no fault of their own, 
who have the skills and desire to make significant contributions. 
Frankly, I fail to see how our Nation benefits from denying hard-
working young people who have grown up in our country from becoming 
productive members of our society. What is the benefit of telling a 
high school valedictorian who has lived in the United States since the 
age of five that he or she can't work, pursue higher education, or 
serve in the military?

As a border State Senator, I understand the concerns about illegal 
immigration. Over the last several years we have made tremendous 
strides in enhancing border security, but I recognize that there is 
still more work to be done.

However, penalizing individuals who came to the U.S. as children at 
no fault of their own is not the answer. Keeping these young people 
from bettering their lives through education or preventing them from 
serving our country by enlisting in the military doesn't make our 
Nation stronger, more secure, or more economically competitive.

It simply deprives the Armed Forces of the ability to reach out to 
the many undocumented students who graduate from high school each year, 
and reinforces a permanent class of less-educated workers who are 
forced to live in the shadows and who are deprived of the chance to 
obtain their full potential.

Over the years I have had the opportunity to meet with some of the 
young people who would benefit from this legislation. Their request is 
quite simple--that they be given the chance to serve the country where 
they have grown up, to make a difference in their communities, and to 
better their lives. These are the values, spirit, and dedication that 
have made America great, and I urge my colleagues to let them earn this 
opportunity.
