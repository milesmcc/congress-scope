`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 8 February 2008`

---


Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a soldier who 
gave his life in the performance of his duty. On October 17, 2006, SSG 
Garth D. Sizemore of Mount Sterling, KY, was on patrol in Baghdad when 
he was targeted by a terrorist sniper attack that tragically took his 
life. He was 31 years old.

Staff Sergeant Sizemore had permission to take some rest and 
relaxation at the base that day, but he bravely volunteered to go on 
patrol. After a first tour of duty in the strife-ridden area of 
Fallujah, Iraq, this was his second tour of duty in that desert 
country.

For his bravery in uniform, Staff Sergeant Sizemore received numerous 
medals and awards, including the Noncommissioned Officer Professional 
Development Ribbon, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Purple Heart.

A fellow soldier once asked Staff Sergeant Sizemore how he felt about 
serving his second tour in Iraq. Staff Sergeant Sizemore replied, ''Hey 
man, I'd rather be at home with my wife, and giving my cat a hard time, 
but if fighting the enemy here in Iraq keeps the enemy from fighting me 
in my own country, then this is where I belong.''

Staff Sergeant Sizemore had served in the U.S. Army since 1999, and 
both his mother, Carolyn Sizemore, and his father, Glenn Sizemore, are 
veterans.

Carolyn and Glenn raised a boisterous boy who loved spending time 
outdoors, whether camping, kayaking, or rappelling. He participated in 
Future Farmers of America. He enjoyed rock music and learned how to 
play the guitar. ''He liked being active,'' says Garth's father, Glenn.

Glenn recalls the time he and a 16-year-old Garth went to a cousin's 
farm to practice pistol shooting. On the way there, Garth told his dad 
that he had dreamed the night before that, while shooting his gun, a 
bullet got stuck in the end of it. That very day, while target 
shooting, the same thing happened to Garth's pistol.

Glenn never forgot Garth's prophetic dream, and attributed it to his 
Native American heritage on his mother's side. An avid gun collector, 
Garth accumulated many rifles and pistols that he had gathered over the 
years.

Garth attended Montgomery County High School and later received his 
GED. He attended Morehead State University for a while, and then chose 
to enlist in the U.S. Army as a career. Starting out with the 
mechanized infantry in Fort Hood, TX, Garth quickly advanced.

''I loved working with Staff Sergeant Sizemore because he took his 
job very seriously and made sure everyone else took their job seriously 
as well,'' says SSG Raja Richardson.

''When young soldiers arrived to the unit, Staff Sergeant Sizemore 
would always remind us by saying, 'These young privates don't know 
nothing but what we teach them.' ''

Staff Sergeant Sizemore took the responsibility of training the men 
under his command very seriously. But that didn't mean his naturally 
engaging personality did not shine through.

Staff Sergeant Sizemore ''possessed a perfect balance of a work-play 
attitude, which was exactly what the young soldiers of his squad needed 
in training and in combat,'' CPT Michael Baka, his commanding officer. 
''He cared deeply for each and every member of his platoon, soldiers, 
peers and leaders alike.''

Staff Sergeant Sizemore served with the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry 
Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, based out of 
Schweinfurt, Germany. While stationed in Germany, Garth met Elena, who 
became his bride.

Sadly, Elena and Garth were married only 18 months before his 
passing.

My prayers are with Staff Sergeant Sizemore's loved ones today, 
including his wife Elena; his mother Carolyn; his father Glenn; his 
grandmother Alliene Sizemore; his grandmother Dora Caldwell; and many 
other beloved family members and friends.

Garth's unit, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, was 
known as ''The Dagger Brigade,'' they had endured some of the roughest 
battles in Iraq. Yet Garth never flinched from his duty.

The Sizemore family held Garth's funeral service in Greenup County, 
KY. Today, his wife Elena has embraced both the State and the Nation 
her husband called home by enrolling at the University of Kentucky and 
making plans to complete an ROTC program and join the U.S. Army.

This U.S. Senate expresses its deepest gratitude to SSG Garth D. 
Sizemore for his service and sacrifice. Our Nation owes his loving 
family, who still grieve for his loss, a debt that cannot be repaid.














sergeant robert w. ehney


Mr. President, I rise to speak today about a son of Kentucky who was 
lost to us in the desert sands of Iraq. On April 23, 2006, SGT Robert 
W. Ehney of Lexington, KY, perished from injuries sustained when an 
improvised explosive device set by terrorists went off under his Humvee 
in the Iraqi town of Taji. He was 26 years old.

Sergeant Ehney was serving as the gunner in that Humvee. It was his 
second tour of duty in Iraq; he had served in the U.S. Army for 3 
years. For bravery in time of service, Sergeant Ehney received numerous 
medals and awards, including the Noncommissioned Officer Professional 
Development Ribbon, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Purple Heart.

''I am very proud of the man he became,'' says Mary Beth Ehney, Rob's 
mother. ''He was proud of being a good soldier, he was a good father, 
he was a good son, a good brother.''

Rob's father, William Ehney, worked for Federal Express, and so the 
Ehney family moved around quite a bit when Rob was young. Rob attended 
school in Centennial, CO, among other places.

Rob took up target shooting as a boy, and continued to enjoy it into 
adulthood. He played baseball, golf and soccer, rode motorcycles and 
was good with computers. Rob loved to listen to music, and before he 
was deployed his family gave him an iPod to take with him as a gift.

Most of all Rob loved playing with his young son Will, who is now 6 
years old.

Rob received his GED and then enlisted in the Army in 2003. He 
entered boot camp at age 23, a few years older than most of the other 
recruits, who were 18 or 19. Soon his fellow soldiers gave him the 
affectionate nickname ''Pops.''

The nickname didn't just refer to Rob's advanced years--Rob took on 
the responsibility of looking after his fellow soldiers. Both his 
mother and dad describe Rob as a caring person who saw his leadership 
skills blossom in the Army.

''He told my wife and I that he was concerned about the young guys,'' 
says his father, William.

''He wanted to be all macho on the outside but a marshmallow on the 
inside,'' Rob's mother, Mary Beth, adds. ''He was just a kind person.''

Marshmallow or not, Rob had the bravery befitting a soldier. Once 
when he called his mother from a deployment, Mary Beth could hear 
''ping, ping, ping'' sounds over the phone. ''Oh, that's just snipers 
shooting at us,'' Rob told his mother when she inquired about the 
noise.



''Do you want to call me back at a better time?'' Mary Beth asked. 
''No,'' her son replied. ''They can't hit anything anyway.''

After Rob's death, William and Mary Beth received a letter from 1LT 
James E. Harris IV, Rob's platoon leader in Iraq, telling them just how 
much their son strengthened the entire unit.

''He was a rock in this storm we face daily over here,'' First 
Lieutenant Harris wrote. ''It was apparent that many of the younger 
soldiers found calm looking up to 'their sergeant' after he lifted 
their spirits and encouraged them to drive on.''

''More often than not I would walk away [after talking with Rob], 
ribs hurting from laughing so much,'' First Lieutenant Harris adds. 
''He was the morale of this platoon.''

Rob had a fiance, Amanda Applegate, and they planned to marry after 
he left active service. Both Rob and Amanda fell in love with Jessamine 
County, KY, just south of Lexington, and wanted to make their home 
there. Rob hoped to become a Jessamine County police officer.

Rob's family held his funeral service in Lexington. The minister for 
the service was the same man who had baptized him, and he told the 
story of how the 6-foot-3 Rob had had to double over in the tank to be 
baptized, and his knees never got wet.

Mr. President, Rob's loved ones have my deepest sympathies on their 
tragic loss. We are thinking today of his son Will, his mother Mary 
Beth, his father William, his sister Casey, his maternal grandmother 
Bobbi Holst, his maternal grandfather Nicholas Reams, his fiance Amanda 
Applegate, and many other family members and friends. Rob was 
predeceased by his paternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. William Ehney, 
Sr.

Sergeant Ehney's devotion to his duty and his fellow soldiers cannot 
be denied. First Lieutenant Harris expressed this best in his letter to 
Rob's parents. This is what he had to say:

''Even though [Rob] did not pass away with his genetic family by his 
side, please know that his brothers were all by his side telling him 
they loved him and that they would carry on for him.''

Referencing Shakespeare's ''Henry V,'' First Lieutenant Harris 
continued, ''[Rob] believed in the quote, 'We few, we happy few, we 
band of brothers . . . for he who sheds his blood with me today shall 
be my brother, and I his.' ''

No words can make up for the loss that Rob's family, fellow soldiers, 
and dear friends have suffered. But I hope the knowledge that Rob loved 
those who were closest to him--his ''band of brothers''--and that they 
loved him in return provides some relief and comfort.

This United States Senate bows to SGT Robert W. Ehney's devotion and 
sacrifice. And we offer our deepest gratitude to him and his family for 
all they have given our Nation.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.
