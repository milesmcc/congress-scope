Ms. BORDALLO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and 
sacrifice of United States Army Private First Class Jaysine P.S. 
Petree. PFC Petree was assigned to the 109th Transportation Company, 
17th Combat Sustainment Battalion, 3rd Maneuver Enhancement Brigade at 
Fort Richardson, Alaska. On September 24, 2010, PFC Petree passed away 
in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. She was 19 
years old.

Known by her friends as ''Jen'', PFC Petree was born in the 
Philippines and moved to Guam in 2002. PFC Petree attended Simon 
Sanchez High School in Yigo, Guam, where she excelled in both academics 
and interscholastic sports. Shortly after her graduation in 2009, PFC 
Petree enlisted in the U.S. Army, and on September 24, 2010, she made 
the ultimate sacrifice while defending our Nation's freedom in support 
of combat operations in Afghanistan. I join our community in mourning 
the loss of PFC Petree and I offer my most sincere condolences to her 
parents, Herbert and Jayne Sucgang Petree, and to her many family and 
friends. We are eternally grateful for her service and will never 
forget the sacrifices of PFC Petree.

May God bless the family and friends of PFC Jaysine P.S. Petree, God 
bless Guam, and God bless the United States of America.
