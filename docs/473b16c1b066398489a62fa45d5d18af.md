# BLUE DOG COALITION

`Mr. ROSS â€” 22 January 2007`

Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, let me be clear the Blue Dog Coalition stands 
for fiscal responsibility and accountability


here at home and in Iraq, and we stand in support of our men and women 
in uniform, and we demand accountability for them to ensure that these 
resources are going to them to support them, to keep them safe, and to 
return them home to their families. May God bless our troops and their 
families.

With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
