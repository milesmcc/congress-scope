Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida, and I 
acknowledge that he is a former Secretary of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, who has done tremendous work on the housing 
issue. I concur with each of his remarks.

I will close with this. When you talk about ''just say no,'' we ought 
to have been on the stimulus debate when we got back here on Tuesday. 
For some reason, and because the majority wanted to, we have been 
debating the Iraq situation while the stimulus and housing sit on the 
sidelines. I hope we can get through these gymnastics and get to a 
situation where we can debate good ideas on both sides and not preclude 
and leave people out. Instead of saying ''just say no'' to amendments 
and to a sincere effort, say yes to what this body is all about: 
deliberation, decisions, and doing what is right for the people of 
America.

I yield the floor.
