Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, on rollcall No. 376 on H. Con. Res. 
288, rollcall No. 377 on H. Res. 546, and rollcall No. 378 on H. Res. 
1407, I am not recorded because I was attending the funeral service of 
a fallen soldier in my district, Army SPC Brian M. Anderson, who was 
killed in action while serving his country in Afghanistan. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ''aye'' on all three resolutions.
