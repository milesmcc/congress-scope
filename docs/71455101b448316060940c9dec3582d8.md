Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, Republicans in Congress are 
talking about dismantling our Social Security system. They want to 
privatize this important program, raise the retirement age, and make 
our seniors pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is simply 
unacceptable.

Seventy-five years ago our Nation made a promise to our seniors. We 
promised to help them through their golden years. This promise has 
served our Nation well, allowing those who built this great country an 
opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their hard work. Social Security is 
one of the most important, successful programs in the United States' 
history, an invaluable program that helps more than 50 million seniors 
and disabled Americans.

Our seniors depend on their monthly checks to put food on the table 
and a roof over their heads. Without this critical help, many of them 
would fall into poverty. Social Security should not be privatized, and 
must remain intact for America's future generations.
