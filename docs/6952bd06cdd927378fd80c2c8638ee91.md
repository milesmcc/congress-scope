# ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS

`Mr. PALLONE â€” 11 July 2007`

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, a week does not go by without at least one 
or two Republican Senators coming forward and saying what many of us 
have known for months, that the President's Iraq strategy has failed. 
First it was Senators Lugar and Voinovich. Then last week Senator 
Domenici joined them in saying that a serious change in course is 
needed. And then on Monday Senator Snowe told NBC News that the time 
has come for binding legislation to bring home most of our troops.

The Senate Republican comments are welcome, but actions speak louder 
than words. Senate Republicans can't just say that a change in 
direction is needed; they have to actually help us change the course of 
the war.

And where exactly are the House Republicans? Does their silence 
indicate that they will once again rubber-stamp the President's failed 
Iraq policy?

If they won't listen to us, they should at least listen to respected 
members of their own party who are saying that we simply cannot 
continue on this same failed course.

Mr. Speaker, this month Democrats will once again demand change in 
Iraq. And it's time that our Republican colleagues join us.
