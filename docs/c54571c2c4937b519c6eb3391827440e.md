## `c54571c2c4937b519c6eb3391827440e`
`Mr. ROSS â€” 15 May 2007`

Mr. ROSS. I thank Mr. Pomeroy for his active participation within the 
fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and for his insight this 
evening.

The gentleman is referring to H. Res. 97, which is the Blue Dog bill 
providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability; and today, 
Chairman Skelton, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, 
announced that key provisions of that bill demanding accountability on 
how your tax money is being spent in Iraq, Madam Speaker, will be 
included in the defense authorization bill that is scheduled to come to 
the floor.

A leader within the Armed Services Committee, someone who is a member 
of the Ranger Hall of Fame, who served our country in the Vietnam War, 
Mr. Marshall, is here, and I yield to you at this time.
