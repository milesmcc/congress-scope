## `a9084f2f73fd471d5581320c5c188555`
`Mrs. BOXER â€” 21 September 2010`

---


Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to express my deep disappointment 
that we were unable to proceed to the Defense authorization bill.

I have been here a while, maybe I am wrong--I am searching my 
memory--I don't remember any time that we voted against proceeding to 
the Defense bill. I am going to go back. Certainly, in the time I have 
been here, I don't remember that.

It is a filibuster just to go to the Defense bill. It is perplexing 
to me because of some of what is in this bill--including funding for 
the defense health program to care for our military personnel and their 
families, including our wounded warriors. We know these wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan have taken quite a toll on our military men and women, 
both in seen injuries and unseen injuries--injuries to the brain.

We know some incredible work is going on. I visited some of the 
research universities that are finding better ways to treat our wounded 
warriors. They are finding better ways to treat terrible wounds that 
result from horrible burns to our brave men and women. Now is the time 
to put those new and better treatments into place and there is a 
filibuster and we cannot get to the bill.

We know there is a military pay raise in this bill for our 
servicemembers. Those voting no to proceed to this are stopping that.

This bill authorizes TRICARE coverage for eligible dependents up to 
age 26. In other words, just as we did in the Health Care Reform Act, 
in this bill we are saying if you are in the military and you have a 
child, you can keep them on your coverage until they are 26.

It provides $3.4 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles 
or MRAPs, which have proven highly successful in protecting our troops 
from improvised explosive devices, and it requires companies to certify 
for all DOD contracts valued over $1 million that they are not engaged 
in any sanctionable activity under the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. So 
we would make sure that the DOD, Department of Defense, is not involved 
in giving contracts to companies that are trading with Iran. This is so 
important, as we seek to sanction Iran for its reckless activity in 
moving toward a nuclear weapon.

In the bill the Republicans blocked is also a repeal of the 
military's don't ask, don't tell policy. The bill includes a provision 
stating that there will be no repeal of this policy until there is a 
certification from the Department of Defense that it will not have 
adverse consequences on our troops.

Some said: Oh, this is just ignoring the Department of Defense, 
ignoring the Secretary of Defense. Not at all. The way Chairman Levin 
put it together definitely has a check on it. So I do not understand a 
lot of my colleagues' claims that it is just a quick repeal with no 
checks and balances from the Secretary of Defense.

I will say it again, it is clear in there, and I will read the exact 
words, that there must be, as we repeal don't ask, don't tell, a 
certification from the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that there will be no significant 
impact on ''military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion 
and recruiting and retention of the Armed Forces.''

I think it is important to note what countries allow gays and 
lesbians to serve. How about 22 of our allies who have fought with our 
service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan: Australia, Britain, 
Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Switzerland, 
Austria, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, New Zealand, Spain, 
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Luxemburg and Norway and 
Sweden. In addition, Israel and South


Africa also don't discriminate against gays and lesbians. I don't know 
who we end up with, but some of the countries I can find that still 
discriminate against gays and lesbians in the service are Iran, 
Pakistan, Cuba, North Korea, and Turkey.

For us to stand with Iran, for us to stand with Cuba, for us to stand 
with North Korea, Pakistan, and Turkey over Australia, Britain, 
Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, 
Germany, et cetera--it just doesn't make sense.

The point is, because we are part of this coalition of 22 other 
nations, our service men and women are already fighting alongside gays 
and lesbians.

A majority of Americans think it is the right thing to do, to allow 
our qualified young men and women to serve regardless of their sexual 
orientation. According to a CNN poll conducted in May, 78 percent of 
Americans said they support allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly 
in the military--78 percent of Americans. We would be standing with 
them and we would be standing with our allies.

Don't ask, don't tell is hurting our military. It is costing our 
Nation--more than 14,000 service men and women have been discharged 
from the military under don't ask, don't tell. It has cost taxpayers 
between $290 million and maybe up to more than a $/1/2/ billion to 
replace servicemembers who were discharged under this policy.

I know many Americans have seen in their living rooms, on the TV, men 
and women who are our neighbors' kids, and our neighbors, who have been 
kicked out of the military even though they were stellar service men 
and women. It is most unfortunate that our friends on the other side 
are mischaracterizing what is in the bill.

We allowed them an amendment to strip that language, and they said, 
oh, well, if we pass this, then the military would be caught off guard. 
Not at all. The way it is written specifies that there must be a 
certification that a repeal would not be harmful to our military.

I am also terribly disappointed we will not have a chance to vote on 
the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act allows those students who have been here 
most of their lives an opportunity to earn legalized status if they met 
certain criteria. Those are kids who were brought over as kids, maybe a 
month or 2, or a year or 2, or 5 or 6 years old. They must have lived 
in the United States for 5 years. They must earn a high school diploma. 
After high school, they must complete 2 years of college or serve in 
the Armed Forces for 2 years. They must demonstrate strong moral 
character, and only those who pass these tests would be eligible to get 
on the pathway to legality. Sixty-five thousand young people a year 
graduate from high school, but they cannot join the military, or they 
cannot go to college, because of their immigrant status. It was not 
their fault they were brought into the country by their parents. I want 
to tell you that our military has said--and I will quote retired Army 
LTC Margaret Stock. She said: ''Potential DREAM Act beneficiaries are 
likely to be a military recruiter's dream candidates for enlistment.''

Let me repeat that. The military itself has said, The DREAM Act will 
result in a military recruiter's dream, because some of these recruits 
are very good with foreign language skills, foreign cultural awareness, 
they are in short supply, and they would be excellent recruits.

Businesses support the DREAM Act. Our economic future is something we 
talk about every day around here. I read a U.S.C. study that said, if 
we finally begin a process where people who are here, who are hard 
working and caring, can stay here and come out of the shadows, it will 
create 25,000 jobs and increase the gross domestic product of my State 
and of the Nation.

That is why I have the San Jose Mercury News, home paper of the 
Silicon Valley, writing an editorial last week in favor of the DREAM 
Act, saying it will boost America's economic competitiveness. So here 
we have the time where we have something on the floor that is directly 
related to the military bill, because the military is saying it is a 
recruiter's dream, this DREAM Act, because they are going to have so 
many people lining up to join. We have Silicon Valley strongly 
supporting this, and I will tell you, the San Jose Mercury News said: 
''The high school dropout rate in this country terrifies business 
leaders, who fear that in the coming decades we will not produce enough 
college graduates with math and science ability.''

That is why the Silicon Valley Leadership Group supports the DREAM 
Act. That is a group made up of Republicans, Independents, and 
Democrats. They wrote: DREAM Act students ''deserve a chance, and the 
U.S. economy needs their knowledge and ability.''

Companies such as Microsoft also support the DREAM Act. They wrote: 
''The DREAM Act rewards those who place high value on education, and on 
service to country.''

Last week the president of the University of California, the 
chancellor of the California State university system, and the 
presidents of State universities in Arizona, Washington, Minnesota, 
Utah, and Washington wrote in support of the DREAM Act. They write in a 
letter: ''In the current international economic competition, the U.S. 
needs all the talent it can acquire and these students represent an 
extraordinary resource for the country. The DREAM Act . . . is an 
economic imperative.''

In closing, I want to talk about a couple of stories. I think this is 
very important. David graduated from high school with a 3.9 grade point 
average. He is studying international economics and Korean at UCLA. He 
has served as the leader of the UCLA marching band, and he spends his 
free time tutoring high school students. After graduation, he hopes to 
enter the Air Force and some day politics. In many ways, he is a model 
college student and a leader in his community. But he was born in 
Korea. He came here when he was 9. His family spent 8 years trying to 
navigate their way to legalized status, only to find out that their 
sponsor had erred in filling out the paperwork.

So here sits David. He had nothing to do with all of this. Here is 
what he says:




 I will not be able to put my name down on a job application 


 because of my status. This country is throwing away talent 


 every second . . . but the DREAM Act can bring thousands of 


 students out of the shadows and allow them the opportunity to 


 work for the country they truly love right now.


I would say these students such as David did not choose to come to 
this country. They were brought here by their parents. The reality is, 
they have grown up here. This is the only country they know. I am very 
disappointed that we are not voting on this important bill today. I 
hope we can take up the DREAM Act later this year. I believe it will 
truly strengthen our economy, our military, and our Nation.

The very last point I want to make as we wind up this Congress is, I 
am so pleased that we passed the Small Business Jobs Act last week. I 
traveled across California. I have met with so many small businesses, 
and I did a conference call with about 10 of those businesses, 
including the Los Angeles Baking Company, the Blue Bottle Coffee 
Company in Oakland, biofuels manufacturer Solazyme, Capstone Turbine in 
Chatsworth, U.S. Hybrid in Torrance, the Back on the Beach Cafe in 
Santa Monica, and the Santa Barbara Adventure Company. These are small 
businesses in my State that are very strong. They could not get access 
to credit to expand and hire. As a result of the work we did, they will 
be able to get that credit. I want to thank the two Republicans who 
crossed over to vote with us. It shows us that we can make progress 
when we work together, because this has to come ahead of politics.

I went to a company called Renova. Renova is helping to make 
California the hub of the clean energy economy. Vincent Battaglia, the 
owner there, told me he has been getting no help accessing the credit 
he needs. He called our legislation ''the missing piece,'' the piece he 
has been waiting for.

Small businesses create 64 percent of our new jobs. That is what 
happened over the last 15 years. I believe this bill will help get them 
back on track. As they get back on track, our recovery will begin to 
have a little more energy behind it. Because it is very slow; it is 
agonizingly slow.

I wanted to state on the Record how much I appreciate the two 
Republicans--
