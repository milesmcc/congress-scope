Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I was here on the floor last 
week reminding my colleagues as my intention is to continue to 
emphasize those who have been hurt by the economic recession, the 
downtrend in our financial markets, that they are, in fact, real 
people. So, in the course of visiting my district and around the 
country, we have met individuals who are suffering.

Today, I met an Iraqi veteran whose parents have built their home 
brick by brick, and now they find that their homestead, these senior 
citizens, their son in Iraq, is having their house foreclosed on.

I met an elderly woman, a widow, whose husband was deceased 7 years 
ago. She's trying to pay the costliness of the heating oil and now is 
being called by her bank that her home, because of her delinquent 
payments, will be foreclosed on.

It is imperative I believe that an economic stimulus package include 
a moratorium on foreclosures in order to ensure that those individuals 
can reconstruct their loans. Mr. Speaker, it is imperative it is a 
stimulus to help people keep their homes.
