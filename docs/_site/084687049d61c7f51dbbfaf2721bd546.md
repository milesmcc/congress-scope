`Mr. DODD â€” 26 September 2007`

---


Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a few brief moments to 
explain my votes this afternoon on two amendments to the Defense 
authorization bill. The first, a resolution offered by my good friend 
from Delaware, and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator 
Biden, expressed the Senate's support for helping the Iraqis to seek a 
political solution to the current conflict in that country by 
supporting three Federal regions in Iraq.

It is still my position that the United States should not impose a 
political solution on the Iraqis to which Iraqis are opposed. According 
to recent polling in Iraq, it seems as though Iraqis are not yet ready 
to divide their country along these lines. However, sectarian divisions 
are already occurring by huge internal displacements in Iraq which are 
direct results of the level of carnage and violence in that country. 
And if Iraqis should decide that they would like to devolve their 
country into three separate sectarian regions, and if they choose this 
method as the best means for ending the current conflict in that 
country, then I would wholeheartedly support that decision. This 
resolution calls for exploring that option, and if Iraqis decide to do 
so, then I will strongly support such action.

I am deeply worried by the language contained in the Kyl-Lieberman 
amendment, and for what purposes this language was introduced. Let me 
be very clear, the Iranian regime is behaving in deeply troubling ways, 
in its quest to secretly acquire nuclear weapons, to destabilize Iraq 
and Lebanon, and by calling for the destruction of the State of Israel. 
We must deal with the various threats Iran poses in an effective, 
smart, and multilateral way, and I am prepared to do just that.

But we must also learn the lessons of the runup to the Iraq war, when 
this body passed seemingly innocuous nonbinding language that ended up 
having profound consequences. Our President must use robust diplomacy 
to address our concerns with Iran, not turn to the language in the Kyl 
amendment to justify his action if he decides to draw this country into 
another disastrous war of choice.

I wholeheartedly agree that we should increase the economic pressure 
on the Revolutionary Guard, or any other entity of Iran, and that is 
why as chairman of the Banking Committee, I held a hearing to determine 
how best to use targeted, robust, and effective sanctions against any 
elements in the Iranian regime who are supporting and exporting 
terrorism and extremism.

But this amendment would not increase economic pressure on the 
Iranian regime--instead it would provide bellicose rhetoric which may 
serve as the basis of future military action against Iran. For that 
reason, I staunchly oppose it.
