Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chair, I commend Mr. Lewis for his leadership 
and work to reduce spending increases in this bill and other 
appropriations bills this year.

But I do have concern about the consequence of limiting funding for 
the World Bank's International Development Association. Doing so I 
believe could harm American credibility and leadership abroad. The Bank 
is doing critical work to help the world's poorest nations weather the 
global economic crisis, limit hunger, and provide for greater security 
in volatile areas of the world.

In Afghanistan, the World Bank helped build and reform the nation's 
telecommunications sector. This helped to attract $500 million in 
private investment, accounting for 60% of all foreign direct investment 
in Afghanistan. The Bank also helped train health care workers in 
Afghanistan, to help increase access to health care there.

As we seek to cut the deficit and prioritize funding, we must also 
consider that we may ultimately lose leverage over the priorities and 
direction of the World Bank should the U.S. fail to live up to its 
commitments.
