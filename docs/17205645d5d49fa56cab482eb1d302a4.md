`Mr. SPECTER â€” 24 October 2007`

---


Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I spoke extensively last night after 
Senator Leahy, the chairman, spoke about the nomination. I will make a 
few comments now, and I will invite my colleagues to come to the floor 
on the Republican side. For those who are interested in time, we have 
only a limited amount, but we will apportion it as best we can, 
obviously equitably. It is my hope that we will move through the 
cloture vote to cut off debate and then proceed to confirm Judge Leslie 
Southwick.

As I said yesterday--and, again, I spoke at some length--Judge 
Southwick comes to this nomination with an outstanding academic, 
professional, and judicial record. On the Court of Appeals in the State 
of Mississippi and the intermediate appellate court, Judge Southwick 
has distinguished himself by participating in some 6,000 cases and 
writing some 950 opinions. His critics have singled out only two cases 
against that extraordinary record. I commented yesterday at length 
about the fact that in neither of the cases in which he has been 
criticized did he write the opinion, but only concurred, and there were 
good reasons for the positions he took.

An extraordinary thing about Judge Southwick is that he got a waiver 
to join the Army Reserve at the age of 42 and then at the age of 53 
volunteered to go to Iraq into harm's way to serve on the Judge 
Advocate General's staff, receiving the commendation of the major 
general which I put into the Record yesterday.

His record shows that he has been very concerned about plaintiffs in 
personal injury cases, about defendants in criminal cases, and has 
looked out for the so-called little guy. As I enumerated yesterday, a 
number of very prominent members of the African-American community from 
Mississippi have come forward in his support--one young lady who was 
his law clerk and others who knew him. It is my view that on the 
merits, there is no question that Judge Southwick should be confirmed.

There has been some concern about the seat he is filling, whether 
there should be greater diversity on the seat. That really is a matter 
in the first instance for the President and then in the second instance 
for the Senate to consider the merits of the individual. It is the 
American way to consider Judge Southwick on his merits as to what he 
has done and as to what he stands for.

We have seen this body very badly divided in the past couple of 
decades along partisan lines. In the final 2 years of the 
administration of President Reagan when Democrats had control of the 
Senate and the Judiciary Committee, President Reagan's nominees were 
stonewalled to a substantial extent. The same thing happened during the 
last 2 years of the administration of President George H.W. Bush. Then, 
Republicans acted in kind during the Clinton administration and refused 
in many cases to have hearings or to call President Clinton's nominees 
up for confirmation. I think that was the incorrect approach and said 
so, in fact, on a number of President Clinton's nominations.

This body had a very tough time 2 years ago when we were considering 
the so-called nuclear constitutional option which would have taken away 
the filibuster opportunity to require 60 votes, and we succeeded in a 
compromise with the so-called Gang of 14. The Judiciary Committee has 
functioned more smoothly during the course of the past 3 years with 
Senator Leahy now the chairman and during the course of the 109th 
Congress in 2005 to 2006 when I chaired the committee.

So it is my hope that comity will be maintained, that Judge Southwick 
will be considered as an individual as to whether he is qualified, 
without any collateral considerations as to the history of nominees to 
the Fifth Circuit. I think if that is done, Judge Southwick will be 
confirmed. It would be most unfortunate, in my judgment, if we were to 
go back to the days of excessive partisanship.

It is an open question as to who the President will be following the 
2008 elections, and it would be my hope that however the Presidential 
election works out and whoever may control the Senate, that we will 
consider the nominees on their individual merits. To repeat, I think 
that will lead to the confirmation of Judge Southwick.

I yield the floor.
