Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise before you today to honor 
Mrs. Barbara Swann, recently awarded the 2008 Congressional Volunteer 
Recognition Award by the 2nd Congressional District of Maryland's 
Veterans Advisory Council. Barbara has been selected to receive this 
award because of her volunteer service at the VA, based on her 
outstanding dedication to serving the needs of veterans within her 
community.

Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces have dedicated themselves to 
protecting the lives of every American. Their service to our Nation 
deserves the highest level of gratitude. It is of the utmost importance 
that we take the time to recognize the individuals who give of their 
time and talents to support veterans and ensure their comfort, care, 
and well-being.

Mrs. Swann currently serves as the Coordinator of Volunteer Services 
for the Baltimore Rehabilitation and Extended Care Center. She has been 
instrumental in an effort to collect non-perishables and other items to 
send to Marines in Afghanistan. While raising a family, Barbara has 
worked early mornings and late evenings, giving of her personal time to 
veterans. She has recruited volunteers and made it a point to ensure 
their proper training, medical examinations, and understanding of HIPPA 
leave.

Madam Speaker, I ask that you join with me today to honor Mrs. 
Barbara Swann. Her compassion and dedication to veterans of the U.S. 
Armed Forces has become an inspiration to us all, and is deserving of 
the utmost gratitude. It is with great pride that I congratulate Mrs. 
Swann on her exemplary service as an advocate and a volunteer.
