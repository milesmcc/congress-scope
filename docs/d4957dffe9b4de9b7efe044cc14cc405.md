Mr. DORGAN. Compared to what we will hear this afternoon, a request 
for $200 billion of emergency funding for the war in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, none of it paid for, and this is a fraction of that to 
reach out to try to provide health insurance to America's children, 
particularly America's poor children.

I am happy to yield for a question.
