Mr. BRADY of Texas. Before coming to the floor, I was with two 
couples from back home. Lisa and Fred Koetting and George and Jeanette 
Coiner and their grandchildren were up here visiting. Mr. Coiner said 
his goal in life is to make sure he helps leave a country that is 
better for his grandchildren than the one that his parents bequeathed 
to him.

They are, like all of us, so worried about the deep debt this country 
is amassing each day, $10 trillion of new debt over the next decade if 
these spending plans go forward. On top of a failed stimulus bill, on 
top of the 2,000-page health care bill no one read, this week Congress 
is going to take up an almost 2,000-page bill that will 
institutionalize bailout and, I think, harm our economy.

We don't have a budget for the first time in 40 years, and this week 
they're going to make up budget numbers. We're not going to have a vote 
on it, not have a debate. We haven't funded our troops in Afghanistan 
and Iraq. They need money, but it's hung up because people here want to 
spend it on other things.

We've got to get this deficit under control. We have to do it or 
we're putting an anchor around our children's necks.
