Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, as of today, H.R. 346, my 
legislation to redesignate the Department of the Navy as the Department 
of the Navy and Marine Corps has 60 cosponsors. Although the language 
of this bill has already been passed by the full House last month as 
part of the Defense authorization bill, I want to encourage my 
colleagues on the floor of the House to join in cosponsoring this 
legislation. When the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act goes to 
conference in the fall, a large number of cosponsors of H.R. 346 will 
show the Senate the House strongly supports this change in name.

This is the sixth year in a row that the House has voted to support 
this change. This year, I hope the Senate will support the House 
position and join in bringing the proper respect to the fighting team 
of the Navy and Marine Corps. I am thankful to the Senate Armed 
Services Committee chairman, Carl Levin, who has said publicly that he 
will ''keep an open mind'' on this issue.

Changing the name of the Department of the Navy to the Department of 
the Navy and Marine Corps is a symbolic gesture, but it is important to 
the team. This change is about recognizing the true meaning of the 
department. The Marines do not serve beneath the Navy. They are co-
equal partners.

Madam Speaker, there is no cost to this change. It is the right thing 
to do for the Marine Corps and the Navy. This legislation has received 
the support of numerous military leaders in both the Navy and the 
Marine Corps.

Madam Speaker, let me quote the Honorable Wade Sanders, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs during the years of 
1993 and 1998, who voiced his support for the change. I quote the 
Honorable Wade Sanders: ''As a combat veteran and formal Naval officer, 
I understand the importance of the team dynamic and the importance of 
recognizing the contributions of team components. The Navy and Marine 
Corps team is just that, a dynamic partnership, and it is important to 
symbolically recognize the balance of that partnership.''

I further would like to quote General Carl Mundy, the 30th Commandant 
of the Marine Corps. He stated, ''I believe the changes you propose 
will do much to clarify the relationship, responsibility and functions 
of the appointed civilian authority over the United States naval 
services. I believe that any Secretary, present, past, or future, will 
be proud to bear the title 'Marine,' as well as 'Navy.' ''

Madam Speaker, I have beside me, and I would read very carefully, 
''The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting this 
Silver Star posthumously to Sergeant Michael Bitz, United States Marine 
Corps.''

Madam Speaker, the reason this is important, this Marine gave his 
life for his country. He left a wife and three children, twins hat he 
never saw that were born after he was deployed to Iraq. And yet, as you 
can see in these orders for the Silver Star, there is the Secretary of 
the Navy, Washington, D.C., and the zip code and Navy flag. There is 
nothing in the heading that says ''Marine.''

Madam Speaker, what this bill will do, if the President should sign 
it, is to say that this Marine who died for this country, that the 
orders for the Silver Star clearly state the team's name. The name of 
the team is the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps.

But what the heading would say in this order for the Silver Star is 
the Secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps, Washington, D.C., with the 
flag of the Marine Corps and the flag of the Navy.

Madam Speaker, I hope that my colleagues in the House this year will 
join me, and let's get over 150, maybe 200 of my colleagues in both 
parties, to sign this legislation so we can say to the Senate in the 
fall of this year, it is time that the Marine Corps be recognized as an 
equal to the Navy. They both are equal in the services, and it is time 
that the Department of the Navy carry the name Marine Corps.

Madam Speaker, I ask God to please bless our men and women in 
uniform, and may God continue to bless America.
