Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, there are few Members on this floor whom I respect more 
than the gentleman who has just spoken. Jim McCrery from Louisiana is 
going to be a loss to this House and to our country. He is a 
thoughtful, fair, and considerate legislator. He represents his State 
well. He has represented this House well. And I congratulate him for 
his service. But people of goodwill can disagree, and I want to make an 
observation on this punitive measure.

In 2004, the Republicans passed a tax bill. Historically, 
manufacturers had gotten a tax break to incentivize keeping jobs here 
and trying to grow jobs in America. The oil companies were not included 
in that law, as the gentleman knows so well, but the Republicans added 
oil companies into the category of manufacturers. Now they are being 
taken out. So he says we added them in and now it would be unfair to 
take them out. They weren't in originally; we are taking them out.

Mr. Speaker, this important legislation is an explicit recognition 
that our great Nation must make critical investments today in the 
development of clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency; energy 
investments that will strengthen our national, economic, and 
environmental security for generations to come.

I appreciated Mr. McCrery's observation that part of this bill was a 
good bill. He disagrees with other parts. That's understandable. But we 
must simply begin to break our addiction to fossil fuels, not because 
the oil companies are bad. They're not. They produce a product that's 
absolutely essential and they create jobs, good-paying jobs. So this is 
not about trying to take it out on the oil companies, but it is to say 
that fossil fuels are a wasting resource. That is to say, we're going 
to use it up, it's going to go away, and we need to look to 
alternatives.

This morning's headline in the New York Times states that the harsh 
reality is ''Gas Prices Soar, Posing a Threat to Family Budget.'' The 
fact is the nationwide average for a gallon of regular gasoline was 
$3.14 this week, an increase of 19 cents in just the last 14 days. Some 
energy experts fear gas prices could hit $4 a gallon by this spring. 
Diesel prices are hitting new records daily, and oil hit a record high 
of $100.88 a barrel on Tuesday.

This, again, is not about the bad oil companies. What this is about 
is America's dependence on foreign sources of oil and on oil generally. 
Either it's going away or we will be in the grasp of OPEC, of nations 
who are not particularly friendly to us: Venezuela; Saudi Arabia 
sometimes, sometimes not; Iraq; Iran; other oil-producing states that 
can go away in a second. We are vulnerable, and we need to look to 
alternatives. That's what this bill seeks to do.

To be clear, this legislation alone will not bring down gas prices. 
But it is a vital step forward and may bring down gas prices 3 years 
from now or 10 years from now or 15 years from now. This bill is 
nothing less than a critical investment in the low carbon economy of 
the future that will result in the creation of millions of new jobs.

It extends the production tax credit for wind, geothermal, and other 
renewables to 2011 and renews the investment tax credit for individual 
homeowners and businesses to maintain incentives for solar energy 
through the end of 2016. Without the prompt extension of these tax 
credits, renewable energy project work stoppages could cost 116,000 
jobs at a time when we're trying to stimulate the economy.

Furthermore, this bill will spur the commercialization of the next 
generation of automobiles by establishing a $4,000 credit for the 
purchase of a plug-in hybrid. Tax credits, tax incentives, are to get 
something that you need and might not otherwise get unless you get an 
incentive. I'm going to speak to that with reference to the oil 
companies in just a second.

It will encourage investments in cleaner fuels, creating economic 
incentives to invest in biofuels, including biodiesel and cellulosic 
ethanol. And it will close the so-called ''Hummer'' tax loophole, which 
encourages taxpayers to buy gas-guzzling SUVs. That makes no sense.

In addition, this legislation will create incentives for the 
construction of energy-efficient buildings and the retrofitting of 
existing homes, which will reduce pollution and energy use.

Finally, the energy conservation bonds included in this bill will 
spur investments in efficiency, create jobs, and reduce carbon 
emissions.

I would think all of those objectives are objectives that this House, 
in a bipartisan way, would seek to achieve.

Now, in keeping with this Democratic majority's commitment to fiscal


responsibility, this legislation will not add to the deficit. I will 
tell you that your previous bills dealing with tax incentives could not 
make that comment. Rather, the tax incentives contained in the bill are 
offset by repealing $18 billion in unnecessary tax subsidies over the 
next 10 years that otherwise will be enjoyed by the largest oil and gas 
companies in America. Mr. McCrery referenced a discussion about that.

Last year alone, the five largest oil companies had a combined profit 
of $123 billion. God bless them. But it only provokes this question: Do 
these companies need taxpayer subsidies to look for new product?

I'm a big proponent of the free market system. Supply and demand 
works. The demand for oil is high. The prices reflect that demand, and 
they are the highest they have been in history. They don't need any 
incentive to look for new product. The incentive is the free market 
system which is buying their product for the highest prices they have 
ever sold it. So it is foolish to ask the taxpayers to not only pay 
those high prices at the pump but also to pay additional taxes because 
the oil companies aren't paying the same kind of level of taxes that 
they are. Last year alone, as I said, they made the highest profits 
they have made.

The answer, of course, to my question, do they need incentives to get 
new product? They do not. They do not. There is not an oil company 
executive in the world who's going to say let's not look for new oil 
when their product is getting the highest prices they have gotten in 
history.

Even President Bush, and I want all my Republican friends to hear 
this. There aren't very many of them on the floor. There aren't very 
many Democrats on the floor. But I hope they are watching on 
television. President Bush, a former oil company executive, said in 
2005, and I want you to hear this quote, George Bush, President of the 
United States, former oil executive, 2005: ''I will tell you, with $55 
a barrel oil, we don't need incentives to oil and gas companies to 
explore.'' I'm sure all of you got that. At $55 a barrel, the President 
of the United States said we don't need incentives for the companies to 
explore.

Prices now are almost 100 percent above that dollar figure which the 
President of the United States said would obviate the need for 
incentives. With the price of a barrel of oil hovering around $100, do 
we really believe that this incentive is justified? The President of 
the United States said no. Hopefully, this Congress today will say no.

This legislation is a thoughtful effort to set our Nation's energy 
priorities and thereby strengthen our national, economic, and 
environmental security.

Last year when we passed the Energy Independence and Security Act, 
the President and Senate Republicans removed a package of economic 
incentives, including the extension of tax credits for wind and solar 
energy and biofuels. We must move towards those alternatives. With this 
bill, we continue the fight for this critical aspect of our energy 
policy.

I thank the chairman for his leadership on this very important piece 
of legislation, and I thank the Republican colleagues on the committee 
as well for working on this product.

We may have differences, but this is a critical issue for the future 
of our country and for generations yet to come. Vote for this bill.
