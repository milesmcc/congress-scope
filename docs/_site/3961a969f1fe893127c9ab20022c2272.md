Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know the majority leader has 
indicated he is going to file cloture on the Levin amendment and is 
setting up a cloture vote for Wednesday. It had been my hope we could 
have by consent set up a process by which we could put the Levin 
amendment in the queue with a 60-vote threshold such as we have had on 
virtually every Iraq amendment this week, and also a 60-vote threshold 
on the Cornyn amendment, which is a logical counter to the Levin 
amendment. As I indicated, it is my understanding the majority leader 
announced earlier it would be his intention to file cloture on the 
Levin-Reed amendment this evening. That would, as I suggested, allow 
for a cloture vote to occur on Wednesday of this week. As I indicated, 
it had been my hope we could have had the Levin amendment and the 
Cornyn amendment in juxtaposition by consent, both requiring 60 votes. 
This has been the way we have dealt with essentially every 
controversial Iraq amendment this year, no matter what bill it has been 
offered on.










Amendment No. 2241 to Amendment No. 2211


Given the majority leader's intention to file cloture this evening on 
the Levin amendment, I now send an amendment to the desk and ask for 
its consideration.
