Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. There 
have been, I would tell the gentleman, some 22 hearings on Iraq by the 
Government Reform Committee, by the Armed Services Committee, by the 
International Relations Committee, by the Appropriations subcommittee 
and by the Committee on Intelligence. There have been extensive 
hearings on this bill. This is a resolution. It is being done in 
conjunction with the Armed Service Committee and the International 
Relations Committee. I do not anticipate that there will be a markup of 
the resolution.
