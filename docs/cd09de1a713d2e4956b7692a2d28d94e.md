Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as a member of the U.S. Air 
Force Reserves a number of years ago, in support of our troops. It is 
unconscionable for the soldiers who defend our freedom to receive 
anything less than the finest medical care.

I visited the veterans hospital in Seattle again recently and talked 
at length to one soldier about the quality of care he has received. I 
was relieved to hear that from the time he was wounded in Iraq to his 
treatment at Bethesda and his time at Seattle's VA Hospital, the care 
that he received was excellent. Unfortunately, this is not the case in 
every hospital for every soldier.

I will soon be visiting Walter Reed to speak with soldiers there and 
make sure they are receiving the excellent care that they deserve. I am 
encouraged by the efforts to hold accountable those responsible for the 
appalling conditions at Walter Reed.

This issue transcends party lines and requires an immediate response 
by all parties. This is about young men and women who have sacrificed 
much for our country and for our freedom. We owe it to them to correct 
this injustice.
