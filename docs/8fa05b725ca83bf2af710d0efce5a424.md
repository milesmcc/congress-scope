`Mr. KING of Iowa â€” 21 June 2007`

Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I would say that we may not have the 
same view on how to proceed in Iraq, but it is my intention to 
foreclose any permanent bases in Iraq and allow those that are under 
agreement now and perhaps temporary ones that might be negotiated to 
get us through this process. I think that is the intent on both sides 
of the aisle. I think that is the intent of the White House. So I 
believe we are consistent in our understanding.
