Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 239 provides 
for consideration of H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement 
Act of 2007 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour and 20 
minutes of general debate with 1 hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight 
and Government Reform. The remaining 20 minutes will be equally divided 
and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Homeland Security.

The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill 
except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the 
amendment in the nature of a substitute, consisting of the text of the 
bill, modified by the amendments, recommended by the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, and printed in the bill, shall be 
considered as adopted.

The bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the 
purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read. The rule waives 
all points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended.

Now, the rule makes in order five amendments, three Republican 
amendments and two Democratic, which are printed in the Rules Committee 
report accompanying the resolution.

The amendments may be offered only in the order printed in the 
report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report and 
shall be considered as read and shall be debatable for the time 
specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent 
and an opponent.

All points of order against amendments, except for clauses 9 and 10, 
are waived.

Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit with or without 
instructions.

Mr. Speaker, today is an important day for the more than 2.7 million 
Federal employees who show us, day in and day out, their commitment to 
improving our great country. It is an important day because the House, 
in bipartisan cooperation, is closing the loopholes which permitted 
retaliation against Federal employees who have reported unlawful fraud, 
corruption, incompetence and abuse of power.

Today is an important day because the House is saying loud and clear 
that whistleblower protection is an essential component of government, 
of government accountability and of government fiscal responsibility.

Throughout our history, whistleblowers have played integral roles in 
improving our government and holding it accountable for its negligence. 
From Shawn Carpenter to Joseph Darby to Mark Felt, and everyone in 
between, whistleblowers have faced harsh penalties from those who would 
prefer that what they know is never shared with the public. They have, 
nevertheless, put their careers on the line, and in some instances even 
their lives, to do what they knew was the right thing to do. Their 
courage is to be commended and their conviction embraced.

When history judges this current administration, I believe it will 
look down upon the drastic and despicable actions taken by this 
administration, which have stifled those seeking to speak truth to 
power. These actions are, indeed, some of the very reasons why this 
bill is so desperately needed.

For example, in 2005, the Bush administration officials placed a gag 
on a senior NOAA official who was scheduled to give an interview 
arguing that global warming exists and has contributed to greater and 
stronger hurricane activity. Three weeks later, Hurricane Katrina made 
landfall, first in my State of Florida, and then in Louisiana and 
Mississippi and Alabama, killing hundreds and leaving hundreds of 
thousands homeless, jobless and ill.

How can we forget former CIA operative Valerie Plame? Her life, and 
the lives of others, were placed in jeopardy after the Vice President's 
chief of staff revealed her name to a reporter in retaliation for her 
husband, former Ambassador Joe Wilson, revealing that the 
administration lied about the existence of weapons of mass destruction 
in Iraq and where they were trying to retrieve uranium from Africa.

When the Bush administration hasn't been able to directly punish 
whistleblowers, it has simply tried to unilaterally change the law. 
Just this past September, after a senior Environmental Protection 
Agency scientist revealed that the administration had purposefully 
misled the public regarding the air safety at Ground Zero following the 
attacks of September 11, the Bush administration issued an executive 
order declaring that EPA employees are no longer covered by Federal 
whistleblower protections. That is outrageous.

These three high-profile cases, and there are a great deal more, 
these three capture only a small snapshot of the problems in the 
current administration. More importantly, they highlight the need for 
extended protection across all agency lines to Federal whistleblowers.

Unfortunately, for nearly the last decade, Federal whistleblowers 
have received nothing more than lip service. Let me make it very clear, 
I said for the last decade, that includes the previous administration 
and this one. Even when the House drafted legislation in 2002 
establishing the Department of Homeland Security, it failed to


include whistleblower protections for DHS employees.

Now, I am proud that I was the author of the amendment which extended 
these protections and was the only Democratic amendment adopted by the 
House during consideration of the legislation. The protection of 
whistleblowers in recent years has unfortunately garnered only lip 
service. Today, the House is backing up these words with real action 
that protects our 2.7 million Federal workforce.

I close by noting that this bill is not perfect. That is why the 
Rules Committee has made five amendments in order, the majority of 
which, I might add, are going to be offered by our colleagues, the 
Republicans, on the other side.

Democrats are proud to continue our efforts to work in a bipartisan 
manner, and to provide the minority with many opportunities to improve 
already good legislation.
