Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, yes, that is true. We were 
willing because the Senator from Arizona had the ability, the courage, 
and the dignity to put this issue before the American people, even 
though--and he knows this--the vast majority of American people do not 
support the escalation in Iraq. But he did it. We were willing to take 
two Republican resolutions--one supporting the surge, one opposing the 
surge--and let Senators from every State in the Union raise their hand 
and tell the American people how they feel about it.
