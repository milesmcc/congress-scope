`Mr. KYL â€” 11 January 2007`

---


Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suppose it was inevitable, the criticism of 
the President's announcement last night. But I ask: What happened to 
all of the promises of last week, the talk of bipartisanship, the talk 
of trying to work together, especially on the biggest challenge of our 
time, this challenge to our national security? Where is the unity that 
we need at this time for this issue more than at any other? I am 
disappointed by the attacks on President Bush's strategy, particularly 
because they come primarily from people who have offered no 
alternative. It seems to me that threatening to cut off funding for our 
troops, as some have done, while not giving the President's Iraq 
strategy a chance, is the worst kind of partisan politics.

When dealing with issues of war and peace, and trying to devise a 
strategy that will result in the least harm to Americans, with the 
greatest chance of success, it seems to me we should be trying to find 
common ground.

The critics of the President throughout last year called for a new 
strategy and interpreted the election results of 2006 as substantially 
a repudiation of the President's strategy and confirmation that there 
needed to be a new strategy.

After consulting with Members of Congress, with generals, with 
retired generals, with other experts, the Baker-Hamilton Commission, 
and many others, the President has come up with another strategy, and 
he announced that strategy last night. It seems to me that we at least 
owe him the opportunity to see whether that strategy can work before 
immediately attacking it as a policy that is bound to fail, especially, 
as I said, because I have seen no alternative.

The only alternative is that we withdraw. There are a lot of 
different ways that we would withdraw, and timetables for withdrawal, 
but they all come down to withdrawing. That suggests that leaving the 
Iraqi forces to establish the stability and peace that is required in 
Iraq is likely to be more successful than the Iraqi troops combined 
with U.S. troops--a proposition which, it seems to me, is incredible on 
its face. So where is the alternative strategy for success?

Now, one of our colleagues, earlier this morning, said:




 We are in a hole in Iraq, and the President says the way to 


 dig out of this hole is to dig deeper. Does that make sense, 


 when you are in a hole, you get out by digging deeper? This 


 is a reckless plan. It is about saving the Bush Presidency. 


 It is not about saving Iraq.


Well, let me talk about the two elements of that--first, the analogy, 
which I think breaks down. I have used it before. It is a good analogy 
in certain situations. But it is a little bit like saying that when the 
first wave of our boys hit the Normandy beaches, because many of them 
were dying, that it made no sense to add more forces, to land the rest 
of our troops on the beach. And that, of course, was not the case.
