Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for 
overriding the President's misguided veto of the Water Resources 
Development Act.

This bill is long overdue. The projects funded in this bill are 
critical to the health, safety and quality of life in our communities 
around the country. This bill is necessary to better protect Americans 
against severe weather and flooding--and also ensure all Americans have 
access to clean, safe drinking water.

The President's veto of WRDA is another example of misplaced 
priorities. We continue to spend $10 billion in Iraq, but won't spend 
the money necessary to make sure we never have another Katrina. This 
bill is about saving lives. In my district we have perchlorate 
contamination in much of the drinking water. H.R. 1495 invests money in 
researching and solving this problem--because no parent should ever 
have to worry that their child is going to get sick from drinking tap 
water.

I urge my colleagues to cast a vote to keep America safe and 
healthy--and override this mistaken veto.
