Mr. WARNER. We worked together on this provision for some time. It 
has been 2 months in the making. I supplied it to several colleagues in 
the House, notably Jim Moran, who is on the Appropriations Committee. 
They seized it and, verbatim, this provision with regard to 
establishing an ability to have, independent of the Pentagon, an 
assessment of the Armed Forces and security forces in Iraq is in the 
House appropriations bill now going into conference. So I believe it is 
imperative that we, this body, likewise put that provision in our 
Senate bill.

I thank my colleague.
