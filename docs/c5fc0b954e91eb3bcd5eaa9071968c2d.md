`Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ â€” 28 June 2007`

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I am listed as voting ''nay'' 
during rollcall vote number 529 on H.R. 2764, the ''Department of 
State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 
2008'' when it was before the House of Representatives on Thursday, 
June 21, 2007. This is an error. I support the Shays of Connecticut 
Amendment on the Iraq Study Group and want it noted that had my 
intention been properly expressed I would be recorded as having voted 
''aye.''
