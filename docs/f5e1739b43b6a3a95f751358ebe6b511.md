Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Chairman, over 20,000 people have died from AIDS 
in the San Francisco-Bay Area, and AIDS continues to be the second 
leading cause of premature death in our area. In addition, and it is 
because of improved treatments, because of programs like the Ryan White 
AIDS program, nearly 23,000 individuals are currently living with HIV/
AIDS, more than at any point in the history of the epidemic. Therefore, 
it is not the right time for the people in the San Francisco-Bay Area 
to have any cuts in their AIDS/HIV programs, because it is starting to 
work but it isn't working well enough, including my own county of Marin 
County north of San Francisco and the county of San Mateo south of San 
Francisco. Our communities have the third largest cumulative number of 
AIDS cases in the entire country.

This amendment will recklessly and irresponsibly put the lives of 
many of our constituents at risk. The very idea truly astounds me, the 
very idea that these lifesaving programs would be cut, that there would 
even be an offer to cut them while we are spending $10 billion a month 
to occupy Iraq just is beyond my comprehension. I have to wonder, what 
are some people thinking about? What are their priorities? I can tell 
you my priorities are with the health and the well-being of our 
constituents.

Treatments and support programs and systems for HIV/AIDS have come a 
long way. Now is not the time to pull the rug out from under the 
programs that are working and to stop supporting those who are living 
with AIDS and HIV, particularly in the most affected areas such as San 
Francisco and Newark, New Jersey. Therefore, I urge my colleagues, 
please oppose this misguided amendment.

Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
