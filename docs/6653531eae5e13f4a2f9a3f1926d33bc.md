Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Filner for his 
strong support of this piece of legislation and to all members of the 
committee. Mr. Boozman has been a strong supporter of our veterans, and 
I appreciate the support for this piece of legislation.

Mr. Boswell so clearly illustrated the need for this piece of 
legislation. I urge my colleagues to stand in support of this 
compromise that has come back from the Senate, and thank Senator Harkin 
for moving it towards us.

As I spoke on this piece of legislation in March, the numbers show 
that veterans' suicide and mental health issues are urgent issues that 
require Congress' immediate attention. Although veterans make up 10 
percent of our population, one in five people who commits suicide in 
the United States is a veteran.

A full 35 percent of our veterans returning from Iraq are seeking 
counseling for mental health issues within the first year. PTSD is fast 
becoming a signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and 
the Veterans' Affairs Committee has seen in countless hearings that the 
need to expand care is there.

H.R. 327 will meet this need. By directing the Department of Veterans 
Affairs to offer mental health screening to veterans, providing 
education to VA staff, contractors and medical personnel, and making 
available 24-hour mental health care for veterans who are at risk, we 
will alleviate some of these hardships.

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation because of the 
critical service it will provide. Although we often have bitter debates 
in this House and are deeply divided over issues like the war in Iraq, 
there is one issue that we all agree on and has the potential to unite 
us and this Nation, and that is the care for our veterans. No one in 
this body questions the incredible sacrifice each of the veterans has 
made on behalf of the United States. And no one questions the 
responsibility that we have in Congress to provide them with the 
resources and the help necessary to live healthy and prosperous lives.

With this legislation, the 110th Congress will again demonstrate its 
commitment on behalf of our veterans.
