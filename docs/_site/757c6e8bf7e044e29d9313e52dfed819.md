Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Is it any wonder we have had such a difficult time 
locating Osama bin Laden? He has been moving between Pakistan and 
Afghanistan for all of these years.

Madam Speaker, I do not believe invoking the 1973 War Powers Act to 
require the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is appropriate at this 
time. In September 2001, Congress passed a joint resolution, signed by 
the President 4 days later, which granted the President the authority 
to use all necessary and appropriate forces against those whom he 
determined planned, authorized, committed or aided the September 11 
attacks in 2001.



So, whether one agrees with the war in Afghanistan or not, whether 
one agrees with the administration's new strategy or not, there should 
be no doubt that House Concurrent Resolution 248, with all due respect 
to my friend from Ohio, is not the way to force a withdrawal of U.S. 
troops. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against this proposed 
resolution.
