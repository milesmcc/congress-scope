Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1052, honoring the 
members of the Army and Air National Guard of the State of Oklahoma for 
their service and sacrifices on behalf of the United States since 
September 11, 2001. I want to commend Representative Boren of Oklahoma 
for sponsoring the legislation.

The units and personnel of the Oklahoma National Guard are remarkably 
diverse and capable. Their contributions since September 11, 2001, not 
only during the global war on terror, but also for the security of our 
homeland, are significant. They have conducted multiple major unit 
deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, including the mobilization and 
deployment of the 45th Infantry Brigade, some 2,700 soldiers, to Iraq 
in 2007. That was the largest deployment for the Oklahoma National 
Guard since the Korean War.

Oklahoma National Guard units also mobilized more than 2,500 
personnel in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, performing 
missions to protect life and property. Since September 11, 2001, the 
Oklahoma Air National Guard has flown numerous air sovereignty missions 
to protect the U.S. mainland.

The successes and contributions of the Oklahoma Army and Air National 
Guard are directly related to the dedication, sacrifices and the 
professionalism of the civilian and military personnel who carry out 
the Guard's missions, and to the outstanding support of families for 
the continued service men and women of the National Guard. Their 
efforts and sacrifices deserve our recognition and thanks. For that 
reason, I urge all Members to support the resolution.

Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
