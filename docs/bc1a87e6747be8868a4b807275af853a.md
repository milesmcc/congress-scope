Mrs. MYRICK. Madam Speaker, I would like to honor CPL Joshua C. 
Blaney. On December 12, 2007, CPL. Joshua C. Blaney of Matthews, North 
Carolina, passed away. He was a member of the 173rd Airborne in 
Vicenza,


Italy, and was serving his country in Afghanistan when his convoy was 
hit by an IED.

Corporal Blaney paid the ultimate sacrifice for his country and his 
life should be remembered. He entered combat in northern Iraq on March 
26, 2003, which opened the northern front and led to the ouster of 
Saddam Hussein from power. He was wounded in Iraq and received the 
Purple Heart. Corporal Blaney served two tours in Afghanistan and 
received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He was a true patriot and is 
an inspiration to all of us. He fought for our freedom and we owe it to 
him and his family to keep his memory alive.
