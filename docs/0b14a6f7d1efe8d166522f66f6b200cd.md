`Mrs. CAPITO â€” 15 September 2009`

Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Jerry 
Alan Jones, a police officer in my hometown of Charleston, West 
Virginia, who died tragically in the line of duty while chasing a 
suspect early Sunday morning. At just 27, Patrolman Jones truly 
exemplified what it meant to serve both his local community and as a 
citizen of our Nation. Before becoming a patrolman with the Charleston 
Police Department, he was a sergeant with the United States Marine 
Corps and helped to secure the Kandahar Airport when the U.S. military 
first went to Afghanistan after September 11. Back at home, he was 
active in his local church, where he met his wife, Samantha. The couple 
recently celebrated their first anniversary together. Today the city of 
Charleston mourns the loss of one of its finest. Patrolman Jones led a 
life to which we should all aspire. We mourn with his wife, Samantha, 
with his family, and we offer our prayers of comfort and remembrance.

I urge my colleagues to join me today in recognition of Patrolman 
Jerry Alan Jones, our friend, protector and hero, for his fearless 
courage in serving the citizens of Charleston and the entire State of 
West Virginia.
