`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 26 January 2007`

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor SMA Marilyn 
Gabbard of the Iowa Army National Guard. The first woman ever promoted 
to the rank of Command Sargent Major in the Iowa Army National Guard, 
Sergeant Major Gabbard was deployed to Iraq on December 16, 2006, and 
died in a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter crash on January 20, 2007, at 2:45 
pm local Iraq time. Her colleagues said of her that she was a role 
model for other women in the Iowa National Guard, and her rise through 
the enlisted ranks was inspirational. She is remembered as a respected 
soldier and caring leader who always put her soldiers first. Her 
military decorations include three awards of the Meritorious Service 
Medal. My prayers go out to Marilyn's husband Edward and her seven 
children and stepchildren, her mother Mary Van Cannon, as well as her 
grandchildren and all her family and friends. SMA Marilyn Gabbard will 
be greatly missed. She leaves behind her a legacy of military 
achievement, immense compassion, and patriotic service. I hope that 
those who have been touched by her loss will find some comfort in the 
knowledge that her memory will live on like those countless other 
heroes throughout American history who have given their lives for our 
country.














 Sergeant Tommy Rieman
