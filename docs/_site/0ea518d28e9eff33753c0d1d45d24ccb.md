Mr. DeFAZIO. Even as the House debates the continuation of the 
failing Bush policies in Iraq, Vice President Dick Cheney, the chief 
architect of the Iraq strategy, is beating the drums for a new war, a 
war with Iran.

On Sunday, we had unidentified sources saying that the highest levels 
of the Iranian Government have directed use of weapons that are killing 
U.S. troops. No information was provided to substantiate the charge; 
administration officials yesterday deflected requests for more details, 
even as they repeatedly implied Tehran's involvement. It may or may not 
be true, but they have got a pretty bad record on intelligence. And now 
MG Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said yesterday 
that he has no information indicating Iran's government is directing 
the supply of lethal weapons to Shiite insurgent groups in Iraq. It 
sounds like the Iraq war intelligence all over again, phony 
intelligence leading us down the path to disastrous involvement.

This has to stop. We start by voting against the escalation of the 
Bush policies in Iraq and begin to chart a new course.
