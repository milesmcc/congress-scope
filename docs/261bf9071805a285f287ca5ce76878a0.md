Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, the tide is turning in Iraq. As The 
Washington Post noted just last week, the number of attacks against 
U.S. soldiers has fallen to levels not seen since before February of 
2006, the bombing of a Shiia shrine in Samara that touched off waves of 
sectarian killing.

The death toll of American troops in October fell to 39, the lowest 
level since March of 2006. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced 
this last Sunday that Sunni-Shiia violence in Baghdad was down more 
than 75 percent in the last year.

But sadly, today the House of Representatives will bring an Iraq 
supplemental bridge fund that once again brings the same tired language 
mandating withdrawal from Iraq.

It seems, Madam Speaker, the Democrats are adding denial to their 
agenda of retreat and defeat in Iraq. Now is not the time to 
micromanage a widening success in Iraq. Let's give the American 
soldiers the resources they need to get the job done, see freedom win, 
and come home safe.
