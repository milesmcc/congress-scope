# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `d01d98d2fe23ef6ecb65bbc8dd1f92a8`
`Mr. TOWNS â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. TOWNS. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding time to 
me, and to say that I thank the leadership of this House. I thank 
Speaker
Nancy Pelosi and I thank Ike Skelton for bringing this 
resolution forward.

You know, I served in the military, and I have great admiration and 
respect for the military, and I also cannot understand why people are 
saying that if you support this resolution you are not supporting the 
troops. I can't make that connection because I support the troops, but 
I must admit I also support this resolution.

Mr. Speaker, 4 years have passed since this administration began its 
ill-fated war in Iraq. No weapons of mass destruction have been found, 
no coalition of nations has fought in the war, and the American people 
are still waiting for a plan for a real war against terrorism.

Though Saddam Hussein is now dead, this fact alone has not been worth 
nearly $400 billion in taxpayer funds, the loss of 3,000 lives, and 
26,000 casualties. What message does this send to the American people? 
I have been hearing this all day long coming from the minority side.

Let me tell you what the message is that we are sending to the 
American people: That our priorities are upside down, and we need to 
fix them.



I have opposed this war from the very beginning, because I was 
concerned that we would come to this point where we would spend all the 
money on the war and not have the resources to do the things to keep 
our Nation and to make our Nation strong.

Almost all the speakers on the other side expressed their support for 
the troops. I want you to know that on this side we also express our 
support for the troops. This administration has asked us to cut funding 
for children, for children's health insurance. We were asked to cut 
critical funds for Medicaid and Medicare, a loss of dollars that may 
cripple our public health system. Many of our hospitals are actually 
closing, and we are asked to provide token funding so No Child Left 
Behind becomes ''most children now are left behind.''

This war and its budgetary requirements are squeezing the American 
people, and I say that enough is enough. But, no, the administration is 
asking


for 20,000 more combat troops and approximately 15,000 support troops. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will cost 
approximately $13 billion.

This administration has had troop surges in the past; this is not 
new. What is different about this troop surge? It is more of the same, 
just more targets we are sending.

In October, the administration sent more combat troops into Baghdad 
to attempt to end the growing violence; however, the violence in 
Baghdad has only grown worse. Now the United States military is caught 
up in a very violent civil war, something they are neither trained nor 
equipped to deal with. Sending additional troops to Iraq actually makes 
things worse for Iraqi civilians and for our troops.

Our military is already stretched too thin. Many soldiers are doing 
two and three and four tours of duty. The administration now plans to 
send additional troops into a city almost the size of New York City, 
and they may have to go house to house in order to keep warring sides 
from killing each other.

What message does this send to the American people when we tell them 
we have no more money for children's health insurance, no more money 
for Medicaid, no more money for Medicare, no more money for senior 
programs and no more money for children's education? And how do you 
think the American people will react to more fatalities and more 
wounded? How long will Congress keep supporting a war that has nothing 
to do with ending terrorism?

I ask the question tonight, how long will this administration keep 
ignoring the real needs of the American people? It is time for America 
to withdraw from Iraq and focus on the real business of the American 
people: better health care, more jobs, education for all of our 
children. We should not send an additional 21,500 troops. That only 
means we are sending additional targets into the area.
