`Mr. BOOZMAN â€” 2 August 2007`

Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, I wish to recognize and commend the 
courageous effort of Marine Corporal Jacob L. Kareus by entering into 
the Record the following letter:



























 May 29, 2007.



 Dear Congressman Boozman: I am writing to inform you of the 


 performance of one of your constituents, Corporal Jacob L. 


 Kareus, United States Marine Corps, son of John L. and 


 Katherine D. Kareus of 7001 Ellsworth, Fort Smith, AR 72903.



 Cpl Kareus recently returned from a seven-month deployment 


 to Haditha, Iraq, with Company E of the Second Battalion, 


 Third Marine Regiment. Upon our arrival, Haditha, a city of 


 approximately 40,000 people on the Euphrates River in the 


 restive Al Anbar Province, had a reputation as one of the 


 most dangerous places in Iraq. Sunni insurgents frequently 


 attacked Cpl Kareus' patrol with small arms fire, sniper 


 fire, grenades and rocket and rifle vehicles. The insurgency 


 maintained a close handle on the populace by an effective 


 murder and intimidation campaign. Through their threatening 


 and pressure of public officials and government workers, 


 insurgents even controlled public works such as water and 


 electricity. Only 15 Iraqi Police remained brave enough to 


 work from the Marine forward operating base, while the 


 recruitment of new policemen was nonexistent. Cpl Kareus and 


 the rest of the Marines in Haditha were the tip of the spear 


 in the Iraq counterinsurgency.



 Through the heroic actions of your constituent, Cpl Kareus, 


 the city of Haditha saw unprecedented progress. By his 


 deployment's end, Haditha's police force numbered over 200 


 policemen and officers--many recruited from the people of 


 Haditha--and they conducted operations independent of the 


 Marines. Attacks on Iraqi Police and Marine patrols decreased 


 from an average of 5-10 per day to a handful per month. 


 Intelligence reports on insurgent activity flowed in 


 regularly from the people. The populace, previously terrified 


 to be associated with the Coalition, eagerly welcomed Marines 


 and policemen into their homes for tea and conversation. The 


 marketplace, or souk, bustled again, children played in 


 the streets, and even teenage girls--previously prohibited 


 by the insurgents from going to school--walked the streets 


 five days per week in their school uniforms.



 As his commander, I wanted to ensure you were aware of the 


 hero from your great state of Arkansas. Cpl Kareus's selfless 


 actions in Haditha honored his nation, his state, and his 


 family. In an age where our ideals of courage and commitment 


 and our resolve have waned, your constituent Cpl Kareus 


 exemplifies the principles of self-sacrifice and dedication 


 to a cause greater than himself.





 Sincerely,























 Captain M.W. Tracy,


















 Company Commander, Company E.

I wish to thank Captain Tracy for taking the time to write to me of 
the heroic service of Corporal Jacob Kareus and the Marines of Echo 
Company. I applaud Corporal Kareus's service to America, as well as to 
the people of Haditha.

The motto for the 3rd Marines is Fortes Fortuna Juvat, which 
translates to Fortune Favors the Strong. It is our good fortune that we 
have the strength of character of men and women like Corporal Jacob 
Kareus serving to protect the freedom of all Americans.
