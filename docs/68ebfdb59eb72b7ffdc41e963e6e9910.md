Mr. BOCCIERI. Well, let me just wrap by saying this: this is about 
jobs in our country that can't be outsourced. It is about our national 
security. And it is about moving away from our dependence on foreign 
oil.

We have set up a free-market approach, one that is supported by both, 
or was supported by both, Democrats and Republicans before we 
introduced it and passed it, but one that is a free-market approach 
with no taxes that invests in regional opportunities for States like 
Ohio and Virginia to make


certain that we have an energy policy that works for this country.

I flew wounded and fallen soldiers out of Baghdad. And it is very 
clear that we have two fronts over in the Middle East, in Afghanistan 
and Iraq and a much broader region because of the oil that that area 
produces. This is about making our Nation stronger. We have to do this 
now. The Department of Defense realizes this, and that is why they are 
testing alternative fuels. We can make that innovation. We believe in 
the American people. That is what this bill is about.
