Mr. KIRK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.

I want to highlight a key provision of this bill, section 7006, which 
withholds 10 percent of the funding under this legislation for the 
Board of International Broadcasting, Radio Deewa. This is a service 
actually that the chairwoman and I helped sponsor and get rolling 
because of our perception that there was very little international 
broadcasting service and outside information in the main language of 
northwest Pakistan and Afghanistan of Pashtun. But we found that they 
were putting Batula Massoud on the U.S. taxpayer-funded radio, giving 
him a platform just 6 days after the Secretary of State put him on the 
Rewards for Justice terrorism list for his crimes against a number of 
terrorist targets, including the Prime Minister of Pakistan. So I 
really want to thank the chairwoman for including this because we sent 
a very clear signal that we want open and free communication with 
accurate news, but we do not give platforms to terrorists on the 
Rewards for Justice list of the State Department.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
