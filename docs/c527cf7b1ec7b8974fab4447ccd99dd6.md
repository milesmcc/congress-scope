Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the courageous 
soldiers of Indiana's 76th Infantry Brigade Combat Team and their 
families for their unwavering commitment to defending our great Nation. 
For many of these soldiers it will be their second trip to Iraq and 
another period of extended time away from their families. I know this 
must be a difficult time for them, but let me stress again how grateful 
I am for such noble service.

The deployment of the 76th Infantry Brigade Combat Team will be the 
single largest deployment of Indiana National Guard soldiers since 
World War II. In sum, approximately 3,400 of our Guardsmen will be 
serving in Iraq when their unit deploys.

I will certainly be keeping these Hoosier soldiers and their families 
in my thoughts and prayers. Thanks to our troops for protecting and 
defending the freedoms we enjoy as Americans. And, thanks to our 
soldiers for their steadfast service to our country.
