Mr. REID. Mr. President, isn't this something? Would I modify my 
request for the Barretts from Sparks to get billions of dollars for the 
troops in Iraq? The answer is no. We have just appropriated $470 
billion, and there will be appropriate measures before we leave here to 
direct, if the Senate wills, funding for the troops. I think the 
American people should see this. Would I modify my request to allow for 
more money for the war in Iraq at this time? The answer is no. This is 
an issue dealing with Lou Gehrig's disease, not a debate on the war in 
Iraq. It deals with people who are sick.

I had in my office last night two marines. One of them lost both his 
legs, a wonderful young man, 21 years old. With him was a man who had 
just gotten out of bed to come to my office. He was on his fourth tour 
of duty before he got blown up in Iraq. We care about those people in 
Iraq. We care about them a lot. That is why we appropriated $470 
billion for the military. That is why we are well aware of the need to 
take a look at funding for more in Iraq. We have given the troops 
everything they have needed. We, the Democrats, have given them more 
than the President has requested, with money for MRAPs, for veterans 
coming home. I hope everyone sees this for what it is.

Will I agree to modify my request to allow for more money for Iraq at 
this time? The answer is no.
