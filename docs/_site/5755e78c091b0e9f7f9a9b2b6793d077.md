Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
strongest possible support for Social Security--an essential lifeline 
that some 130,000 seniors in my congressional district depend on every 
day.

Social Security is an earned benefit that American workers have paid 
into


over a lifetime of their careers. That is why it is outrageous, at 
least from my perspective, to hear some of my colleagues propose to cut 
Social Security as a mechanism to reduce the national deficit or to pay 
for the war in Afghanistan.

This is irresponsible, shortsighted, and overwhelmingly reckless; and 
I personally won't stand for it. Social Security is one of the only 
Federal programs that has a dedicated source of revenue, what we pay 
into that has paid for itself in full for over 75 years now without 
contributing to the national deficit. In south Florida and around the 
country, seniors rely on Social Security as a stable, guaranteed source 
of income in their retirement years, particularly in these tough 
economic times.

I adamantly oppose and will work to defeat any attempts to weaken 
America's retirement security and pay down national debt unrelated to 
the Social Security program--all on the backs of our Nation's seniors.
