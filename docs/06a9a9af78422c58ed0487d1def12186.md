# HUMPTY DUMPTY

Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, as we continue our debate on funding for 
Iraq escalation, I want to share a new version of a well-known poem 
entitled Humpty Dumpty:



 Bush, Cheney and others had a great call--


 Remake Iraq, it will be such a ball.


 Now all Bush's troops and all daddy's men


 can't put Iraq back together again.


 Our soldiers keep dying, day after day.


 So why put up with more endless delay?


 Let's just acknowledge what everyone knows:


 Bush didn't and doesn't have any clothes.


 He broke it, can't fix it, doesn't know how;


 Mission impossible: out of Iraq now.
