Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, you know, nobody likes war. I don't 
like it. My constituents from Fort Campbell that are fighting this war, 
they don't like it. But they understand it.

And we all know there are some things worth fighting for. Freedom is 
one of those things. Freedom is one of those things.

Listen to this from British historian John Stuart Mill. He said back 
in the 1800s, ''War is an ugly thing, not the ugliest of things. The 
decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks 
that nothing is worth war is much worse.'' People that don't care, that 
is what is worse.

Using our troops as a political tool during a time of war is not 
wrong. It is ugly. It is downright ugly. It is wrong, and it 
jeopardizes our national security. Just yesterday, Iraq's Ambassador to 
the U.S. said American troops are critical to the success of that.

Today we stand and recognize the demise of al Masri, the leader of al 
Qaeda in Iraq. Tenacity. Focus. That is what yields results. Our men 
and women are getting results. It should be the first priority. We 
should all be reading this bill. We should recognize war is ugly.

Veto the bill, Mr. President.
