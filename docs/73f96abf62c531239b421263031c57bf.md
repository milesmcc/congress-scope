# CAREGIVERS AND VETERANS OMNIBUS HEALTH SERVICES ACT

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, the service men and women serving overseas 
have born the brunt of the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act ensures that 
when they return, they will obtain the quality treatment and health 
care they deserve.

This legislation addresses many of our veterans' most urgent needs. 
Record numbers of service men and women returning home are suffering 
from posttraumatic stress, and this bill ensures that mental health 
services are more accessible. The bill ensures that women don't get 
second-class health care by expanding coverage for women's health, 
including care for newborns. The bill also eliminates health care 
copayments for veterans who are catastrophically disabled.

Many politicians use the slogan ''support the troops'' when they mean 
''support this war.'' This bill actually supports our troops--by 
providing them the care and support services they need when they return 
home. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
