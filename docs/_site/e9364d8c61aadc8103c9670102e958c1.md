Ms. KILROY. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart, at the 
loss of one of America's and Ohio's best, Sergeant Jesse Balthaser of 
Hilltop, of The United States Marine Corps, 1st Marine Division, 3rd 
Combat Engineer Battalion. Heroically, Sergeant Balthaser died when he 
stepped on an IED on September 4th during a fire fight in Helmand 
province, Afghanistan. This magnificent young man has done several 
tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He was getting ready to come home 
in November to witness the birth of his first child, already named 
Regan Michael, in December to Erin McSweeney his girl friend and future 
wife. Words can not ease their pain, and of that his parents Richard 
and Nancy Balthaser who have now lost their only child in service to 
our country. Our prayers and our thoughts go out to them in this time 
of such sorrow. Our nation owes a great debt to all the families and 
their loved ones of the Armed Forces, who teach us, That freedom, 
surely is not free. Bless them all.



 So Brilliant, This


 So . . .


 So Brilliant This!


 As is, as was Jesse's gift!


 That Last Full Measure! That Oh So Such Golden Treasure!


 As all in his short lifetime defined . . .


 Of One's Life, As Is This . . . So Brilliant, in time . . .


 While, all in the darkness of war . . .


 While, all in a heart and soul . . . of such faith to insure 





 . . .


 To insure our freedom, but, bought and paid for!


 Yes Jesse, but with your most precious life!


 Oh yes you Jesse, so shone with your most brilliant light . . 





 .


 All in your magnificent shades of green . . .


 As there you were, our son so bravely seen!


 Oh yes, you United States Marine!


 Where Strength In Honor, So Convenes!


 As so gallantly, you so ventured forth . . .


 All out upon death's course . . .


 As for us, you walked through The Valley of Death . . .


 With a heart of courage full, and clenched fist!


 As America's Son! As on high, as your courage crested!


 As all for God and Country, your most courageous heart could 





 not so be stilled!


 And your United States Marines, Ohio's Best as you moved 





 onward still!


 As our nation with your sacred sacrifice, all of ours lives 





 have so blessed!


 As a Mother and a Father cries, as their only son has died . 





 . .


 As for them, we now so weep . . . deep down in hearts, so 





 very deep!


 As a future wife's, great love has been 





 lost . . .


 And their new child to be born out of love, will bare the 





 cost . . .


 But, hush little baby don't you cry!




 Because, one day up in Heaven you will look into your fine 





 Father's eyes!


 And Jesse, on this night as your loved ones lay their heads 





 down to sleep . . .


 Out across Columbus, but comes a gentle rain . . . that which 





 so weeps . . .


 So Weeps, Our Lords tears . . . falling down from Heaven so 





 very deep . . .


 All in his love for you, and your most brilliant gift . . .


 And for your heartbroken family so very deep!


 To ease their pain . . .


 And in the comings years, we will see you . . . all in our 





 tears . . .


 All in your beautiful child of love, most beautiful face . . 





 . so very dear!


 So Brilliant, This!
