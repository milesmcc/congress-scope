Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, the comments of the previous speaker simply 
indicate how little she understands about the appropriations process.

The fact is that the Iraqi bill we had to deal with was last year's 
supplemental request. Last year's, not this year's, so we had to clean 
up your mess on the entire domestic budget; and we had to clean up your 
mess on Iraq before we could move on our business.

The first week we have been able to turn to our agenda is this week. 
We have spent the last 5 months cleaning up your spilled milk.
