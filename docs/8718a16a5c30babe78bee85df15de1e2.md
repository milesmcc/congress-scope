Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.

I'm very sorry that my friend wouldn't yield so that we could engage 
in debate. And I will say, victory means ensuring that our children 
don't face the threat of another terrorist attack like what we saw on 
September 11. We know that Iraq is the central point for al Qaeda, and 
I am absolutely determined to ensure that we achieve victory.

There have been tremendous achievements when it comes to democracy 
building. We can't ignore that. But we want to bring our troops home as 
soon as possible.
