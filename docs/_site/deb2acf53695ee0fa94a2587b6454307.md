# WAR SUPPLEMENTAL IS BAD POLITICS, BAD POLICY

`Mr. KINGSTON â€” 21 March 2007`

---


Mr. KINGSTON. I wanted to point out one more time: Civilian 
casualties a month before the surge, 1,440; casualties after the surge 
beginning February 15, 265. Bombings have dropped 40 percent, from 163 
to 102. And that would just be general bombings, IEDs. And then car 
bombings are down 35 percent, from 56 to 36. That is progress we are 
already seeing because of the surge.

And I want to get the guys home, but you need to complete the job, 
you need to have victory and make sure that we do not have to go back, 
and an arbitrary pullout date would cause that.

I also want to say this: I really do believe the Democrats are right 
in having more oversight. Frankly, I think that, as Republicans, we did 
not get the


oversight that we should have. We should have been tougher on some of 
the testimonies that we received. And I think that their suggestions of 
what the Iraqi Government should do aren't far off. But I think giving 
them deadlines when we have trouble passing legislation ourselves, I 
think that is a little unreasonable.

But then the biggest part is the arbitrary pullout date of March 
2008. And I think you are setting up failure when you are doing that. 
That decision has got to be made by our generals in Baghdad.
