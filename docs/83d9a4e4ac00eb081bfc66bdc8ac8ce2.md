`Mr. INHOFE â€” 25 September 2008`

---


Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to three of 
Oklahoma's finest heroes.

SGT Daniel Eshbaugh, of Norman, OK.

CWO Brady Rudolf, of Oklahoma City, OK.

And CPL Michael Thompson, of Harrah, OK.

They were among the soldiers who were killed on September 17, 2008 in 
Tallil, Iraq, when their CH-47 Chinook helicopter crashed while en 
route from Kuwait to Balad Air Base north of Baghdad.

SGT Eshbaugh, CWO Rudolf and CPL Thompson were members of Detachment 
1, Company B, 2nd Battalion, 149th Aviation, from Lexington, OK.

The unit, which is made up of approximately 200 Texas and Oklahoma 
Guard members, was mobilized in June and left for duty in Iraq in late 
August.

All three were on their second tour in Iraq.
