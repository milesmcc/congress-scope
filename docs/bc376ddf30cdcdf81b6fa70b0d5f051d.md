# THE PROGRESSIVE MESSAGE

`Ms. WATSON â€” 5 November 2009`

Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure and an honor for me to 
come down and join my colleague, Keith Ellison. He has been a driving 
force to bring reality to the public.

Congressman Ellison, I want to thank you for your diligence. What 
really gets to me is the misstatements, the fear that has been put out 
to the public. And think about this: Why are people ranting about 
health coverage and not reasoning about it?

They have made fun of our President, Barack Obama. They have 
disrespected him on this floor when a Member hollered out for the first 
time in the history of this House, ''You lie.'' I hope the world saw 
that and questioned what that was all about.

When they talk about Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to be Speaker, and 
talk about PelosiCare, that it is going to take benefits away from 
seniors, those are lies.

I tell people when they come up to me, remember, we started off 
trying to cover Americans that had no insurance, somewhere around 38 
million. Private insurance companies make profits off your health care. 
They make profits off the condition you are in. Why should health, good 
health, be profit-making? We should address the health needs of 
Americans.


Now, you are going to hear the opposers say, You are putting our kids 
and our grandkids in debt. Well, they never said that when we fought an 
unnecessary war in Iraq, costing us $15 billion a month. If we were to 
send additional troops to Afghanistan, it is going to cost us $5 
billion. And what do we get as a result of that? Do you think we are 
going to be able to stabilize these nations thousands of miles away at 
the expense of our people and our country?

Just today, there was a horrible massacre on one of our greatest and 
largest bases, Fort Hood in Texas. Think about all the medical 
personnel that would have to be there to care for those 31 that were 
injured. Twelve people lost their lives. And one of the suspects is a 
mental health professional, a major who is a licensed psychiatrist. 
What does that tell you?

So what are we trying to do? If we want to be the strongest Nation on


Earth, we have to be sure Americans are strong. We have to provide for 
those less able than many of us.

You are going to hear people say you don't want government running 
your health care. They don't do anything successfully. Then you are 
already condemning our victory that some people are expecting in Iraq 
and Afghanistan and so on. If government doesn't do anything 
successfully, then we all ought to go home. We are a fraud.

But ask this question: What is Medicare? What is Medicaid? What is 
Social Security? These are government-run programs as part of that 
safety net.

In the richest country on Earth, why should anyone go hungry or go 
without health care? If we had a government-sponsored option, and let 
me just define for the people who don't understand the meaning of 
''option,'' ''option'' says you make the decisions. It is a 
misstatement to say that government will get in between you and your 
doctor. That is so untrue, and the people who are saying that know it.
