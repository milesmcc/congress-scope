Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I always supported the efforts in Afghanistan. But 
last weekend I went to Afghanistan. And as much as I want to support 
the country and I want to support this bill, I cannot. The problems 
there are overwhelming. Ninety percent of the women are illiterate and 
a huge majority of the men. Twenty-five percent of the children die 
before age 5. Thirty years of war has devastated any possibility of 
leadership in that country. Women area abused and beaten. Drug 
addiction is rampant. There is corruption in the government and 
corruption in the military.

In Afghanistan we were told it would take 10 to 15 years to turn this 
country around--10 to 15 years. So we either go full throttle or we 
just say, okay, because we can't just string it along like we did in 
Vietnam. Their needs are far more than one country can give. If other 
nations would stand up and do what we have done and give the same 
commitment of their people and their talent, Afghanistan could turn 
this around. And we could help them. But the world won't adopt 
Afghanistan. And we cannot be a single parent there.



Our focus now has to be Pakistan, the greater risk.

And so I will not be able to support this bill.
