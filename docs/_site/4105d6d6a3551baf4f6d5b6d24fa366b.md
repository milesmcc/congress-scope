`Mr. SARBANES â€” 2 May 2007`

---


Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Congress sent the President an 
emergency supplemental bill that provides our soldiers and our veterans 
everything the President asked for and more. It was a bill supported by 
the American people, this Congress and military experts who believe it 
is time to change the course of the war in Iraq. The President's 
response? A veto.

The President's action last night shows not only his stubbornness and 
his inability to work with others, it also demonstrates that he simply 
refuses to change the status quo.

The President refuses to give our troops, this Congress, or the 
American people any timelines as to when this war will end or under 
what conditions he would finally bring our troops home.

Mr. Speaker, the President says that things are getting better in 
Iraq, but that's simply not true. Last month was


one of the deadliest months for American troops in Iraq. One hundred 
four soldiers were killed.

It's time for a new course. It's time for the President to sit down 
and work with this Congress so we can finally produce the change that 
will end this war.
