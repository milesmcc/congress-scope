Mr. LOEBSACK. Tomorrow the American Legion will host the second 
annual Heroes to Hometowns Golf Classic at Andrews Air Force Base. This 
event will benefit the American Legion Legacy Scholarship Fund, which 
was established to provide educational support to children who have 
lost a loved one in Iraq and Afghanistan. This year's golf classic will 
bring together 80 wounded warriors and veteran business owners in what 
I'm sure will be a resoundingly successful event.

As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have seen the positive 
impact that events like this have on our wounded warriors. As a former 
college professor, I also know the impact that a college education 
makes in the lives of our children. This golf classic is just one more 
example of the incredible work that the American Legion does on behalf 
of our veterans and military families, and I wish all the participants 
a good day on the courses.
