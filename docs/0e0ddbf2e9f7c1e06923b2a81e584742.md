Mr. KUCINICH. I yield myself another half minute.

Reclaiming my time, if the gentleman supports the idea of the U.S. 
presence in Afghanistan on the ground, then your logic would follow 
perfectly. However, what I am saying is that following the language of 
the War Powers Resolution. We've had three troops killed there. The 
atmosphere for the U.S. in Pakistan is quite hostile. A Gallup poll 
demonstrated that. People don't want us in their country, as the 
gentleman from Texas pointed out.

I reserve the balance of my time.
