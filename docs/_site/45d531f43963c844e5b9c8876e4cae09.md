Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and 
sacrifice of the brave men and women stationed at Fort Campbell who I 
have the distinct privilege to represent in Congress.

Later this week, soldiers from the 101st Airborne, Air Assault will 
be deploying yet again to Afghanistan to help defeat extremism in a 
nation not yet completely safe from those who prey on freedom. For many 
of these courageous Americans, this will be their 4th or 5th tour to 
either Iraq or Afghanistan.

There is no doubt that these frequent deployments have taken a 
serious toll on military families. However, when I had the opportunity 
to visit with the soldiers readying for deployment, they looked at that 
fact as just an example of the supreme confidence that our military 
leaders have in their ability to accomplish our mission as efficiently 
and effectively as possible. I, for one, could not agree more.

In a very short period of time, our country will be marking the 10th 
anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks. And along with 
that, we recognize the decade-long commitment from our service members 
and their families to prosecute the Global War on Terror and bring 
peace and stability to a war-torn region of the world.

Madam Speaker, I hope that every member of this body will keep the 
soldiers of the 101st Airborne, as well as all of the members of the 
Armed Forces, in their thoughts and prayers as they continue to keep 
our country safe and secure.

May God bless and watch over our Nation's finest and their families, 
and may He continue to bless the United States of America.
