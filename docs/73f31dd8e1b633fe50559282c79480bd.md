Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2/1/2/ minutes to the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. Shays). Members should know that Mr. Shays has been to 
Iraq 17 times and has been outside the umbrella of the military four 
times, and probably understands this issue in the Congress probably 
better than anybody else.
