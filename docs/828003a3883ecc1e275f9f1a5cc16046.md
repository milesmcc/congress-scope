Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the ranking member.

Mr. Chairman, the purpose of the amendment that we have is plain and 
simple. It's to protect the privacy of America's fallen heroes and 
their families.

Along with my colleague and friend from Oklahoma, Congressman Boren, 
I introduced this measure at the request of mothers of Marine Private 
David Burridge and Army Corporal Joseph Thibodeaux, both of Lafayette, 
Louisiana, who lost their lives in Iraq in September of 2004. While 
still recovering from the shock and the loss of their children, these 
mothers were appalled to discover the names of their sons had been 
printed on the back of T-shirts and sold for profit.

This amendment before us today requires that our military men and 
women, or their surviving relatives, be the sole decisionmaker in 
consenting to use their name or image for commercial purposes. While 
there is no way to ever express in words the significance of their 
sacrifice, we have a duty to honor and protect their memories and, most 
importantly, their rights.

No one can dispute that Americans, and particularly Members of this 
body, have fundamental differences over the war in Iraq. All Americans 
certainly have a right to express these views in public, but Americans, 
and particularly our fallen heroes and their families, also have a 
right to protect their names and images from commercial exploitation. 
This amendment accomplishes just that.

I want to thank Chairman Skelton, our Ranking Member Hunter, as well 
as the Rules Committee for allowing this amendment to come to the 
floor.

I urge our colleagues to support this nonpartisan legislation.
