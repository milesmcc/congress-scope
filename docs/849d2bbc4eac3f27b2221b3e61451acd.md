Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I rise in strong support of the conference report on 
the National Defense Authorization Act. This bill is what Americans 
have been waiting for. There's a military pay raise of 3.4 percent to 
say thank you to our troops. We prohibit fee increases on TRICARE 
patients for 1 year, something many of my constituents have worried 
about; increases the size of the military and relieves the burden on so 
many of our troops. It provides money for the National Guard and for 
Reserve construction projects, saying thank you to the National Guard 
and recognizing their hard work. It prevents permanent bases in 
Afghanistan and Iraq.

I'm also pleased that my amendment to repeal the National Security 
Personnel System has been included in the conference report. The 
Department of Defense employees will be returned to the previous 
system, the one that 80 percent of them liked and approved because it 
was a fairer system.
