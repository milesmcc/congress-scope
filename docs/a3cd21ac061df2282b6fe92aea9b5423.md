`Mr. REID â€” 15 March 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, this week has been a week full of a lot of 
work, a lot of surprises but a lot of results. We finished the 9/11 
bill, which is something the Senate should feel very good about. We did 
that on a bipartisan basis with the leadership of Senator Lieberman and 
Senator Collins.

Today we completed a 2-day debate on Iraq. It was a good, civil 
debate. Both the majority and minority issued their statements. I 
thought they did them well. We were able to have some votes. I think it 
was something that brought dignity to the Senate.

We had three judicial nominations approved--two district court 
judges, one circuit court judge. We are doing our level best to not 
have any problems with judicial nominations. The President is doing his 
share of helping us with this by sending us some good people. We have 
had agreement on the U.S. attorney bill that has been done with 
bipartisan support. This is set up for debate starting Monday. We will 
complete that on Tuesday morning.

Then, finally, again, using the Lieberman-Collins example, the 
chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad and 
Senator Judd Gregg, did a wonderful job. There is not a more 
contentious issue that comes before this body than the budget. All 100 
Members believe they can do a better job than either Judd Gregg or Kent 
Conrad can do, but they have the responsibility of coming up with the 
budget. They worked together for a number of years. They are friends 
and they set a good example. This matter was completed by 3:30 this 
afternoon.

Next week is going to be a tough week. There will be a lot of 
amendments offered, and we look forward to that. But we have a 
statutory way of proceeding through this. Whoever drew the statute 
probably had too much to drink the night before. But at least that is 
the statute we have. It is 50 hours, and unlimited amendments can be 
offered. But at least we know what we are up against next week because 
we have done it many times.

In short, this closely divided Senate, at this stage during the final 
weeks of Senator Johnson's incapacitation, is 50 to 49. He will be back 
with us soon. But even then, it is 51 to 49. It is a very closely 
divided Senate, and we are getting work done recognizing that there can 
be no bullies in the Senate, that we have to work together to get 
things done.

I think we have accomplished a lot this week. All 100 Senators 
deserve a pat on the back.

If there is no further business to come before the Senate today, I 
would turn to the Republican leader to see if he has comments before we 
adjourn.
