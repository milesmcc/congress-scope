Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to Sergeant 
First Class Kristopher Chapleau, from LaGrange, Kentucky, who lost his 
life on June 30, 2010, of injuries sustained at Forward Operating Base 
Blessing, Afghanistan.

He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st 
Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Fort 
Campbell, Kentucky.

Sergeant First Class Chapleau was a thirteen year veteran infantryman 
and platoon leader who enlisted in the Army in 1997.

He was the beloved husband of Terry Chapleau and a father to four 
young children, Jacob, Tyler, Angelica and Kimberly.

Today, as we celebrate the life and accomplishments of this 
exceptional Kentuckian, my thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant First 
Class Chapleau's family and friends.

We are all deeply indebted to Sergeant First Class Kristopher 
Chapleau for his service and his sacrifice.
