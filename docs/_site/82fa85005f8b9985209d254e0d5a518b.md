Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise today to support the 
amendment that I authored with my friend, Congressman John Yarmuth of 
Kentucky.

Although some of my colleagues and I have differing views on our 
strategy in Iraq, one thing is clear: after five years and $600 billion 
of American taxpayer dollars spent, ''enough is enough.''

That is why Mr. Yarmuth and I are offering this amendment today. Our 
amendment declares that any future Status of Forces Agreement that is 
negotiated between Iraq and the United States must include cost-sharing 
measures so that that the Iraqi government can take more 
responsibility.

With an expected Iraqi budget windfall of some $60 billion this year, 
it is time for Iraq to stand up and take responsibility for its own 
future.

All of our districts are feeling the pinch of tough economic times 
here at home. Critical domestic priorities are being underfunded or not 
funded at all.

Our amendment would help put our economy back on track and would send 
a message to the Iraqi government that they must participate in their 
own future.
