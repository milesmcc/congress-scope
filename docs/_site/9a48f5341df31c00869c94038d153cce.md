Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, on October 29, 2010--while this House was 
in recess--the Republic of Turkey celebrated Republic Day, and observed 
the 87th anniversary of its founding. As a co-chair of the 
Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans, I take this 
opportunity to belatedly congratulate our Turkish friends and recognize 
the longstanding friendship between the United States and the Republic 
of Turkey.

For over fifty years, Turkey has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the 
United States, making significant contributions to the peace, security, 
and prosperity of both its immediate neighborhood and the wider world. 
An ally in the global struggle against Communism during the Cold War, 
Turkey has and continues to contribute a great deal to our efforts in 
Iraq and Afghanistan as we act to secure those countries and give them 
the tools to chart their own courses and become constructive members of 
the community of nations.

Turkey's international contributions reflect the visions of its 
founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, of a vibrant secular democracy. In 
times of great change and uncertainty, while there may be questions or 
differences of opinion about the threats we face, this should be seen 
as the actions of a mature ally. I do not believe that anyone can 
question Turkey's commitment to easing tensions, resolving some of the 
key issues of our time, and its friendship with the United States.

As new members of the Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish 
Americans have come to discover, Turkish Americans are also playing an 
important role in strengthening the bonds between our two countries. 
Turkish Americans come from all backgrounds and and make important 
contributions to all sectors of our society. Additionally, they are 
participating in greater numbers in the social, political, and economic 
aspects of our national life. I welcome this engagement, and know that 
it enriches us as a people.

Again, my congratulations to Turkey and all of its friends in this 
country on the observance of another Republic Day.
