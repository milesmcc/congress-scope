Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I will just make a brief point and then 
yield to the gentleman from Ohio.

With the deepest respect to the gentlewoman, no one is implying that 
there is not concern by every Member of this body for those who have 
drug problems, for those whose lives are being ruined by meth. But you 
can't just wish these problems away. Somebody's got to take 
responsibility for working to end those problems.

Just like you can't wish them away, you can't expect that they are 
going to be dealt with by cutting investments in antidrug programs or 
even cutting the rate of increase, if you want to use the other side's 
terms.

We've put $40 million in this bill for mobile enforcement teams for 
antidrug programs; not mobile enforcement teams in Iraq, mobile 
enforcement teams right here at home to help the gentlewoman's 
constituents with those problems, to provide for a better future. We're 
investing in that future. We can't just wish these problems away. 
You've got to respond to them, and that's what we are trying to do.

Now, if the other side made the argument that we could cut giveaways 
to big oil companies and cut offshore tax corporate giveaways and cut 
all this corporate welfare and then cut these important criminal 
justice programs, then their arguments would have more credibility. 
Their arguments lack credibility because they're saying we can afford 
all these corporate giveaways, but we can't afford enforcement teams on 
drug abuse, we can't afford more cops on the street while crime is 
increasing, we can't afford counterterrorism initiatives and extra 
agents at the FBI while al Qaeda is planning against us.

This is just a difference in priorities, Mr. Chairman. We are strong 
on crime. We also understand that if you're going to be strong on 
crime, you can't just say it, you've got to do it, and frankly, it 
takes investments to do it.

That's what this bill does, and that's why every Republican on the 
committee supported this bill when it was in the committee, and that's 
why this amendment will be defeated by Republicans and Democrats alike.

Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. Ryan).
