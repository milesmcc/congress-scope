Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, at a time when the American people are 
demanding a change of direction in Iraq, congressional Republicans are 
more than willing to provide the President another blank check to 
continue the status quo.

After 4 years of incompetent planning and bad projections, it is time 
that Congress hold both the Iraqi Government and the Bush 
administration accountable. And yet Republican leaders continue to say 
we should just give the President what he wants, no questions asked. 
That is what the old Republican-controlled Congress did six times.

Later this month, the House is going to have a choice: give the 
President another blank check to move ahead with the status quo in 
Iraq, or take the war in a new direction. The U.S. Troop Readiness, 
Veterans Health and Accountability Act is that new direction. Far from 
being micromanagement, as many Republicans call it, this legislation 
sets policy for equipping our troops, policy for refocusing the war on 
terror, and policy for a responsible redeployment.

I urge all of my colleagues to seriously consider this change in 
direction.
