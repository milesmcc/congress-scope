Mr. LEVIN. The Armed Services Committee held two excellent hearings 
to consider the final report of the working group that reviewed the 
issues associated with the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. That report 
concluded that allowing gay and lesbian troops to serve in the U.S. 
Armed Forces, without being forced to conceal their sexual orientation, 
would present a low risk to the military's effectiveness, even during a 
time of war, and that 70 percent of the surveyed members believe the 
impact on their units would be positive, mixed, or of no consequence.

As one servicemember told the working group:




 All I care about is can you carry a gun, can you walk the 


 post.


In combat, the troops have told us that what matters is doing the 
job.

We also learned during the course of our hearings that while 
predictions of problems after repeal were higher in combat units than 
among troops, this commission found that the difference disappeared 
among those who had actual experience serving on the front lines with 
gay colleagues; that is, experience is a powerful antidote to negative 
stereotypes about gay service members.

We learned that when our close allies, Great Britain and Canada, were 
preparing to allow open service by gay and lesbian troops, there were 
concerns about problems there. Those concerns totally disappeared after 
they changed their policy to allow service, but those concerns--that 
level of concern in our allies' armies was higher than the current 
level of concern in our troops. Both those countries and other allies, 
such as Israel, made the transition with far less disruption than 
expected, and their militaries serve alongside ours in Afghanistan with 
no sign that open service diminishes their or our effectiveness.

Secretary Gates has assured everybody he is not going to certify that 
the military is ready for repeal until he is satisfied with the advice 
of the service chiefs that we have mitigated, if not eliminated, to the 
extent possible, risks to combat readiness, to unit cohesion and 
effectiveness. We learned that Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, and 
other senior military leaders are concerned that unless we pass this 
law; that is, without this legislation, they are going to be forced to 
implement a change in policy not when they can certify that they are 
ready, as provided for in this legislation, but when a court orders a 
change. The only method of repeal that places the timing of repeal and 
the control of implementation in the hands of our military leaders is 
the enactment of this bill.

There are a lot of reasons the repeal of don't ask, don't tell can 
and will, hopefully, happen, but we know it can happen without harming 
our military's effectiveness. Those are the reasons we can do this 
safely, but there are other reasons why we must end this discriminatory 
policy. In Admiral Mullen's memorable words, it is a policy which 
''forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to 
defend their fellow citizens.'' We should end this policy because it is 
the right thing to do.

Some have argued that this is social engineering or that this is 
partisan, even though this change is supported by the overwhelming 
majority of the American people. They are grossly mistaken.

Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?
