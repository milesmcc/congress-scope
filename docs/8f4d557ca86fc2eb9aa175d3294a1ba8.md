`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 4 October 2007`

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I want to say that the most important point that 
I'd like to highlight before we leave, because I know time is running 
out, all of the waste over the past 6 years under this administration, 
with the nonsense with FEMA and trailers sitting in Arkansas somewhere 
that have rotted, the billions of dollars wasted in Iraq where unbid 
contracts, Halliburton wasting money, losing hundreds of millions of 
dollars in cash, the tax cuts that went primarily to the top 1 percent, 
corporate welfare that goes to the oil companies, $14 or $15 billion, 
we are starting to rein all that in and the President picks children's 
health care to draw the line in the sand and say we're spending way too 
much money?

That is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. That is unacceptable. All of these 
opportunities wasted, and now you pick these people? You don't take on 
the oil companies. You don't take on the top 1 percent billionaires who 
got tax cuts. You're going to take on little kids? That's the message? 
That's your legacy? God bless you.
