Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this war is a terrible tragedy, and it is 
time to bring it to an end. This is a straightforward bill to redeploy 
our military forces from Iraq and to end the war in Iraq, and I want to 
thank the leadership for bringing it to the floor today.

This bill would allow the administration and joint chiefs 3 months to 
plan a safe and orderly redeployment process, and then an additional 6 
months to carry it out. It provides for the orderly transfer to Iraqi 
authorities the military bases and facilities we have constructed and 
occupied on their national territory, as General Petraeus himself has 
always insisted would happen when we depart from Iraq.

The bill permits U.S. Armed Forces to remain deployed in Iraq in 
order to protect U.S. embassy and diplomatic personnel. It also allows 
limited special operations to pursue members of al Qaeda and other 
global terrorist organizations, and it continues the training and 
equipping of Iraqi security forces.

Mr. Speaker, this bill does not walk away from Iraq or the Iraqi 
people. It specifically continues diplomatic, social, economic, and 
reconstruction aid; and it allows the President to provide asylum or 
other means of protection to those Iraqi citizens who might be 
physically endangered by our leaving Iraq because of services they 
provided to our military personnel.

Finally, this bill leaves all the decisions on the locations outside 
of Iraq to which our troops will be redeployed wholly in the hands of 
our military commanders. They may be deployed to neighboring countries 
or transferred to Afghanistan. Many, I hope, would be sent home by 
commanders, grateful that their service is now completed. And many of 
our proud Guard and Reserve units would, I hope, return to their 
stateside duties to protect our homeland.

Mr. Speaker, there is no nice, neat, easy way to leave Iraq. Every 
Member in this Chamber understands that. But it is the right thing to 
do. The American people have chosen us to act on this matter, and we 
must act.

Redeployment of our troops will set a new dynamic into motion in Iraq 
and the region. It will force the Iraqis, their neighbors, and the 
international community to finally confront the tough issues of 
reconciliation. Until we leave, no one has to make the hard choices 
about how Iraqis are going to live together or die together.

Like all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I stand in awe 
of our uniformed men and women, who have performed fearlessly and 
tirelessly in Iraq. But we should no longer demand that their sweat, 
blood, and lives be sacrificed on the altar of Iraqi sectarian 
violence. They are needed elsewhere, in Afghanistan, in the region, and 
here back home. Their duties, their global mission and purpose 
continue, but Iraq must find its own way.

Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. For four long deadly years, this 
administration and their allies in Congress have been flat wrong about 
Iraq. The time has come for us to begin redeploying our troops from 
Iraq in a safe and orderly manner.

Now, every one of us, whether we voted for or against the war, has a 
responsibility for the men and women who have been put in harm's way. 
It is easy to say stay the course; but I would remind my colleagues, 
none of us will wake up tomorrow in the midst of a civil war in Iraq. 
None of us will have to go on patrol in Fallujah or Baghdad. We owe our 
troops better than rhetoric; we owe them honesty and action.

For me, this is a vote of conscience. For me, this is a way to 
restore the good and decent name of the United States. For me, this is 
a way to best serve our men and women in uniform, by bringing them home 
to their families.

I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill and vote to end the war.
