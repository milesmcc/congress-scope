Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I would like to request the 
House's attention today to recognize the life of a proud American hero, 
Captain Kyle A. Comfort.

Captain Comfort, of Jacksonville, Alabama, died in Afghanistan on May 
8, 2010, in service to our Nation. He is survived by his wife Katherine 
Brooke Comfort, their daughter Kinleigh Ann and his mother Ellen 
Comfort.

Like all those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in this conflict, 
words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family, and 
the gratitude our country feels for his service. Captain Comfort died 
serving the United States and the entire cause of liberty, on a mission 
to bring stability to a troubled region and liberty to a formerly 
oppressed people. He was a true patriot for serving our Nation, and he 
will be missed.



We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the House's 
remembrance on this mournful day.
