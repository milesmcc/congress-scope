Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate that comment from my good friend and 
colleague, the senior Senator from Vermont. The MRAP-all-terrain-
vehicle is very important to protecting our forces in Afghanistan. 
Since 2005, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has allocated well 
over $25 billion to purchase MRAP vehicles, which have a V-shaped 
bottom and several unique features that deflect energy from roadside 
bomb blasts, prevent fragments from penetrating, and, in turn, save 
people from attack.

The original versions of the MRAP have saved thousands of lives in 
Iraq; however, they are very large, and this array of vehicles does not 
fully suit the more rugged environment our deployed forces faces in 
Afghanistan. There, we see very few paved roads. Many are simple dirt 
roads, slit through the sides of mountains at higher altitudes. Our 
forces need a vehicle that possesses a lower center of gravity and that 
can go off-road, but possesses the same level of protection as the 
original version of the MRAP.
