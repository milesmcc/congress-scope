`Mr. GOHMERT â€” 19 April 2007`

Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we have heard over and over again once 
again in this debate about all the lies that got us into this war. 
Let's go back to the lies that got us in this war. And I was really 
gratified to hear my friend across the aisle, from Ohio, a moment ago 
refer to a quote from the Bible. In that same book, it constantly talks 
about forgiveness.

Yes, we heard the administration talk about weapons of mass 
destruction over and over again, the Secretary of State, but it is high 
time we moved on. It is time to forgive President Clinton for all those 
lies. It is time to forgive Madeline Albright for all those lies. It is 
time to forgive President Bush for being so dadgum gullible that he 
believed all the stuff that was passed on to him. So let's forgive them 
and move on.

Now to fulfill, Mr. Speaker, a commitment that I had at the funeral 
of Travis Buford from Douglas in my district: He died February 22 in 
Iraq, an IED, and among the tears, as we stood there, it was an open 
casket, and I asked his mother if there was anything I could do. She 
said, just tell the Congress to shut up and let the military finish 
their job. I've done what I said I would.
