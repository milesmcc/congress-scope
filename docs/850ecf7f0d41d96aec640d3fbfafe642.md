Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge my colleagues 
to support this amendment offered by myself and Representative Grayson, 
which would direct the Inspectors General responsible for oversight in 
Afghanistan to include in their auditing and assessment protocols the 
impact U.S. development assistance has on the objectives of the Afghan 
Freedom Support Act of 2002 to advance political and human rights, 
health care education, training, security, and shelter for women and 
girls.

Mr. Chairman, I recently returned from a congressional visit to Kabul 
and Kandahar where we met with women from all walks of Afghan life. 
Unfortunately, the roles and experiences of women are not always 
considered in wartime or during stabilization and reconstruction 
operations.

These women want to contribute to the stabilization and 
reconstruction of their nation. That is what we heard from not just a 
few Afghan women who are in political or professional positions, but 
from the poorest women who simply want the ability to care for their 
families, access education and health care, and feel safe and secure in 
their communities. If we don't include women, we are ignoring 50 
percent of the population that is eager and has the desire and capacity 
to be agents of change.

Ultimately, it is in the interests of the national security of the 
United States to prevent the emergence of a terrorist safe haven in 
Afghanistan. The kind of instability women in Afghanistan are submitted 
to has a direct and a negative correlation to their ability to help 
stabilize their communities.

The situation for women has been made worse by a lack of security, 
corruption in Kabul, and passage of oppressive measures such as the 
Shia personal status law. Every conversation that I have had with 
commanders there, including on our recent trip, assures me that the 
kind of gender apartheid that is occurring in Afghanistan undermines 
our national security. So we cannot sit idly by and do nothing about it 
if we are to stabilize this region and bring our troops home.

During a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing on the 
effectiveness of U.S. assistance and counterinsurgency operations, the 
GAO witness highlighted the importance of empowering women but noted 
that her agency had not focused on the advancement of women in 
Afghanistan. And


she went on to state, ''Investment in women is often a pivotal 
investment focus for returns on economic growth and economic 
development in countries.'' And I believe that, and I also believe that 
this is true for political growth as well.

In education, some say if you don't test it, you won't teach it. 
Well, without these metrics, we can't know how our aid is impacting our 
women. We are reshaping our commitment to the Afghan people in a way 
that fosters trust, promotes justice, and protects human rights. The 
protection of the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan and their 
full and equal participation in Afghan civil society is essential to 
Afghan national security as well as ours. And I urge my colleagues to 
reach out to the women of Afghanistan when they're traveling there, 
because we know that when you include them in your delegation 
conversations, they, too, can express their concerns to you. Even our 
male colleagues will have that opportunity with any number of women 
there.

I want to thank Mr. Berman for his support, and I urge the adoption 
of this amendment.

I yield back my time.
