Mr. STUPAK. Ninety-five to 98 percent of those playing in this market 
have no intentions of taking possession of oil or providing a product. 
They are there for one reason, to rake all the profits off the American 
people that they can through their excessive speculations.

This Democratic Congress has also passed a Renewable Energy Tax Act 
to help lessen our dependence on foreign energy sources.

Look. Since this war started in Iraq, everything has doubled and 
tripled. We have heard nothing from the other side. This Democratic 
Congress continues to do things to try to curb the abuses we find in 
the energy field, that we find in manipulation of prices and 
speculation. We will continue to work towards that.

To come down here and somehow try to rewrite history, it is just not 
going to work. It is important to note that tax breaks that are 
eliminated in the Renewable Energy Tax Act are equivalent to less than 
1 percent of the oil companies' net income, but yet they complain.
