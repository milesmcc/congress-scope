`Mr. PENCE â€” 18 December 2007`

Mr. PENCE. At 3,500 pages, 34 pounds, members of the minority had 
roughly 1 day to review its contents. Mr. Speaker, here comes the bus. 
But the American people don't want this Congress to get on. Last night, 
the House passed a massive omnibus spending bill that gives deafening 
evidence that this government is broken. This budget process is broken.

I want to commend men and women of good will in this Congress who 
improved this bill along the margins, but $515 billion without a penny 
for Iraq is wrong and evidence that the budget process is broken. $515 
billion with $10 billion in budget gimmicks and hundreds of unexamined 
earmarks gives evidence that this budget process is broken.

President Reagan said it 20 years ago from this podium. He said: 
''The budget process is broken down; it needs a drastic overhaul. With 
each ensuing year, the spectacle before the American people is the same 
as it was this Christmas.'' He added: ''Budget deadlines delayed or 
missed completely, hundreds of billions worth of spending packed into 
one bill, and a Federal Government on the brink of default.''

The more things change in Congress, the more they stay the same. Say 
''no'' to the ominous omnibus bill.
