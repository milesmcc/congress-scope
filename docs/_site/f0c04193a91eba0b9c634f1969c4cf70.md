Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by 
Congresswoman Gwen Moore and really applaud her for that and for her 
passionate remarks on behalf of this amendment.

In the 8 years since the overthrow of the Taliban, women in 
Afghanistan have made major strides forward. Ninety-one of 
Afghanistan's 351 parliamentarians are women, and two women have 
announced their intention to run for President this year.

However, many women in Afghanistan continue to fight for basic human 
rights. Violence against women, rape and forced marriages continue in 
the country's most unstable regions. In April we saw images of stones 
being thrown at a woman protesting a law legalizing marital rape.

Afghanistan's future will depend on its women building more stable 
and healthy and thriving communities. The women of Afghanistan have 
borne the brunt of years of warfare, but they will also form the 
underpinning of a peaceful Afghanistan.

This amendment recognizes that limiting the rights of women is 
counterproductive to all of our efforts to help Afghanistan move 
forward from the devastating damage of Taliban rule.

I urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to stand up 
for the women of Afghanistan who are suffering, who deserve our help.
