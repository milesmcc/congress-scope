Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor two of my constituents, 
true community servants, Mr. John and Bonnie Enstrom.

The Enstrom's built the Veterans Lake Park in Ramsey, Minnesota to 
honor our fallen heroes. The park hosts the only monument in State 
dedicated to all Minnesotans who lost their lives as a result of the 
global War on Terror. The monument also contains a list of veterans who 
died in the Iraq war to protect our Nation's freedom.

Over $1 million has been personally invested by the Enstrom's to 
ensure that the park is well-kept and beautiful. Veterans visit the 
park and enjoy its quiet, relaxing environment. It has been seen as a 
safe haven to help the Vets mentally and emotionally recover.

Our Nation's heroes sacrificed their comforts and safety so that 
Americans can enjoy their continued freedoms. For their great efforts, 
veterans deserve much from the American people. Its efforts like those 
of the Enstrom's that truly show our appreciation for these heroes.

Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate Mr. and 
Mrs. John Enstrom for their exemplary service to our Nation's heroes. 
The time and work that they both have sacrificed to serve the military 
men and women of our great State of Minnesota will not be forgotten.
