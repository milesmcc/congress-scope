Mr. PATRICK MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, as we prepare to 
mark the 5-year anniversary of the war in Iraq, I would like to take a 
moment and offer a moment of silence for the brave and the fallen, 
including 19 members of my unit, the 82nd Airborne Division, who never 
made it home.

On this somber occasion, we are united behind our troops. We honor 
the memories of thousands, and we pledge our support for those still 
fighting for our freedom.
