`Mr. BUTTERFIELD â€” 1 May 2007`

---


Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, it is absolutely correct: 4 years ago 
President Bush stood before this sign declaring ''Mission 
Accomplished,'' but today he insists on staying the course. To 
accomplish our own mission, President Bush needs to listen. He needs to 
listen to the retired military generals who support the approach of 
this Congress.

Retired MG Paul Eaton said, ''This bill gives General Petraeus great 
leverage for moving the Iraqi Government down the more disciplined path 
laid out by the Iraq Study Group.

LTG William Odom said, ''The bill gives the President a chance to 
pull back from a disastrous course, reorient U.S. strategy to achieve 
regional stability, and win help from many other countries, the only 
way peace will eventually be achieved.''

Major General Montano said the bill ''not only reflects the thinking 
of the


Iraq Study Group but puts teeth to the phrase of 'supporting our 
troops.'''

Madam Speaker, the President needs to listen. He needs to listen to 
these retired generals.

And, Mr. President, I will not address you directly, but I would ask 
you, Madam Speaker, to allow me to say that the bill will be on his 
desk this afternoon.
