Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator who has helped us frame the 
debate has arrived on the floor, the Republican leader. I have heard 
him say repeatedly that we want a result. This is not a time for 
playing games. This is not a time for scoring points. This is a


time when Americans--South Dakotans, Alabamians, Tennesseans--we are 
all hurting.

I get stories from marines who do not have money for their vacation 
with their family after 18 months in Iraq, from moms who are losing 
their job because they cannot afford the commute.

We have an opportunity. We could be doing it this day. We could be 
debating Senator Thune's proposals on wind and renewable energy and 
biofuels, Senator Sessions' proposals on conservation and plug-in 
vehicles. Yet we are in this parliamentary procedure to block us from 
offering anything that has to do with finding more and using less--
except the one proposal.

I see the Republican leader in the Chamber. I wonder if he would 
agree with me that the American people are ready for the Senate to act 
and get a result on $4 gasoline, and the Republicans are at least as 
interested in using less oil, giving big oil some competition, as we 
are in finding more?
