## `a0d12bb9baee5e5a2cf6c874aec69dc6`
`Mrs. LINCOLN â€” 12 March 2008`

Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, wish to thank the Budget 
Committee chairman and express my appreciation for his hard work and 
that of the ranking member for their diligence throughout this budget 
process.

I would also like to thank my colleague from Massachusetts for the 
many ways that he affects the lives of Americans all across this great 
Nation in support of a multitude of things but without a doubt in terms 
of higher education and in making that opportunity available to young 
adults across this country who want to reach their potential, who want 
to give back to their country, and through reaching that potential are 
able to add more of the gift they have to give this world and certainly 
to our Nation. His tireless work in those areas has been unbelievably 
important to students in Arkansas--I know myself, having gone to school 
with a student loan--but without a doubt realizing that potential, 
realizing that opportunity, and making it available for Americans all 
across this country. Senator Kennedy has done tremendous work, and we 
applaud that.

I also again want to applaud Chairman Conrad, who has done a 
phenomenal job in bringing together a budget that I believe truly 
reflects the values of this country and the values of the American 
people. The budget is a blueprint document. It is a place for us to 
really express our priorities as a Congress. We move forward with a 
budget that we hope reflects the things we hear from our constituencies 
and the ways they want to see their Nation, their Government, investing 
in this country.

They want to see us investing in the education, the human capital 
that is going to continue to make this country great. They want to see 
us investing in infrastructure and in children, in health care and in 
opportunity, where we can improve on all of these many


things; investments in rural America as well as the needs that exist in 
our urban areas.

It is a tough job to balance all of that and truly reflect our values 
as Americans, because we are diverse. It is one of the greatest things 
about being a part of this Nation, to know that region upon region is 
different, and individuals in those regions are different. But the fact 
is, we are all under one common denominator--Americans. As a country 
and as a government, we want to see that investment in who we all are. 
I think the chairman has painstakingly looked at how we combine in this 
budget the values, the morals, and the issues of who we are and the 
investments we want to make and setting those as priorities as we move 
forward in the process we have.

My purpose for rising today is a simple one, and that is to better 
ensure that the men and women who have courageously served our Nation 
in uniform receive the benefits to which they are entitled in a more 
timely manner.

Last year, we came before the Budget Committee and set forth our 
priorities. One was very similar to what Senator Kennedy was just 
visiting about, and that was to ensure that our Guard and Reserve are 
going to get the educational benefits they deserve, the ones they had 
earned.

Our Guard and Reserve have been called to duty in a much different 
way in the conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan than we have seen ever 
before, and making sure their rewards and their incentives for 
education are commensurate with the Active-Duty members they are 
fighting alongside is important. We were successful with that, we were 
successful in ensuring their ability to access those benefits in a 
timely way, because before they only had 1 year. Now we have given them 
more time to be able to access those benefits when they return home out 
of theater and out of Active Duty.

This, again, is another issue in terms of timeliness, in how we 
respond to our veterans and the courageous men and women who serve us. 
The amendment that will be offered on my behalf momentarily--and I will 
be offering it with my friend and colleague from Maine, Senator Olympia 
Snowe--would do just that on timeliness. We are joined by Senators 
Biden, Clinton, Mikulski, and Pryor.

Mr. President, I would also like to ask unanimous consent that my 
colleague, Senator Lieberman, be added as a cosponsor as well.
