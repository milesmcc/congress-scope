Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of 10 brave women 
and men who were killed in a tragic attack in northern Afghanistan in 
August, and to express my support for the resolution by the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania which we will consider here today.



This team of dedicated humanitarian aid workers was led by my 
constituent, Dr. Thomas Little. Tom and his wife, Libby, lived and 
worked in Afghanistan for more than 30 years. They raised three 
daughters there, Katie, Molly, and Nellika, and ran an organization 
that has long provided the majority of eye care services in 
Afghanistan. Though I am proud to call them constituents, Afghanistan 
has been their home.

Like so many parts of America, New York's 21st Congressional District 
has witnessed far too many deaths overseas this year, a fact no less 
true across the districts of Afghanistan where Tom Little worked with 
sight and lived with vision. Tom and his team were heroes, and I am 
honored to recognize their service and sacrifice to America, 
Afghanistan, and the ideals that unite us all.
