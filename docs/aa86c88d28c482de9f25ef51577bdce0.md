Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, Congress as a coequal branch of 
government must be prepared to act to bring our troops home from Iraq. 
Congress must have an exit plan and take steps to implement it. 
President Bush has every intention of keeping the troops in Iraq 
through the end of his term. However, the money is there to bring the 
troops home now. If Congress appropriates more money for Iraq, the war 
will escalate and more troops and innocent civilians will die. The 
American people voted for a new direction. That direction is out of 
Iraq. Let us rescue our troops. Let us rescue a domestic agenda. Let us 
reverse policies which have created chaos, massive civilian casualties 
and destruction in Iraq. Let us reunite the community of nations in the 
cause of stabilizing Iraq.

The U.S. cannot do this as occupiers or as agents of contracting and 
oil interests. We can do this only once we have stated our intention to 
end the occupation. Next week I will be presenting to this Congress a 
workable plan which can enable our Nation to bring the troops home, 
assure an international peacekeeping force and begin to close this 
perilous chapter in our Nation's history.
