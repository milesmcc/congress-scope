Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage of a 
brave and dedicated hero of the Fort Worth community and of our Nation.

Cpl James H. McRae was a proud United States Marine and a true 
American hero who gallantly and selflessly gave his life for his 
country on July 24 during combat operations in Diyala Province, Iraq.

James enlisted in the toughest of the military branches during time 
of war, which speaks volumes about his character and patriotism.

Assigned to the Marine Expeditionary Force, James was a non-
commissioned officer--the backbone of the corps and a true leader.

Our thoughts and prayers are with James' parents and all of his 
family and friends.

Our community and Nation honor Corporal McRae's memory and we are 
grateful for his faithful and distinguished service to our Nation and 
the Corps of Marines that he loved.

Cpl James Heath McRae will not be forgotten. His memory lives on 
through his family and the legacy of selfless service that he so 
bravely imprinted on our hearts.
