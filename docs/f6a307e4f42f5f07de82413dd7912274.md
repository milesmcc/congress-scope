Mr. EMANUEL. In addition, this legislation requires that for all 
future rebuilding of Iraq, the Iraqis must put in 50 percent of the 
dollars. For too long we have asked the American people to foot the 
bill for Iraq's future. Finally we have turned the page and require the 
Iraqis to stand up for Iraq. This is the first step in that process.

So for Sean Walsh and for the future of this country, at the height 
of the GI Bill we were once spending 2 percent of our GDP on our GI 
Bill, this is the first real investment in America for our kids.
