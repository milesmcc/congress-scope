Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 62, a 
resolution congratulating the Grand Valley State University Lakers for 
winning the 2006 NCAA Division II Football National Championship.

Head Coach Chuck Martin and his team have helped to bring national 
reknown to GVSU's campuses in Allendale, Grand Rapids and throughout 
West Michigan with their excellence on the field. Over the past five 
years, the Lakers have won four National Championships in their 
division, a feat that has been duplicated at no other level of college 
football in the same time span.

The senior class of this team compiled a four-year record of 52-4, 
making them the winningest senior class of football players in NCAA 
history. Led by quarterback Cullin Finnerty, Eric Fowler and Mike 
McFadden--each of them named first-team Little All-America players by 
the Associated Press--the Lakers dominated their competition to an 
undefeated 15-0 season, culminating in a 17-14 championship victory 
over the Northwest Missouri State University Bearcats on December 16, 
2006, in Florence, Alabama.

The game was witnessed by 7,000 fans in the stadium and by a 
worldwide audience including our soldiers in Iraq and elsewhere, who 
watched the game on the Armed Forces TV Network. One GVSU official, my 
former press secretary, Chris Barbee, reported hearing from two 
soldiers in Iraq congratulating the team on its victory.

The Laker football team is emblematic of Grand Valley State 
University as a whole--a thriving, bustling university in West Michigan 
with more than 23,000 students and nearly 2,000 faculty and staff. The 
university, led by its new president Thomas J. Haas, is striving for 
excellence at all levels academic and athletic alike.

Congratulations again to Grand Valley State University, Coach Martin 
and his staff, and all the players, support staff and fans who made 
this championship a reality.
