## `13f8ebad66175f550400e63d48f8f30c`
`Mr. REED â€” 16 November 2007`

Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we face an opportunity to change the 
course and the direction of our policy in Iraq. The other body, the 
House of Representatives, has sent a provision--a bridge appropriations 
supplemental--to us, which includes language that would change this 
policy. It would change our missions, it would establish a goal to 
complete the transition to this new mission by the end of next year, 
and it would invest resources, energy, and effort in diplomacy as well 
as military activity. I think it is critical to do that.

We have, for the last several months, seen an increase in American 
forces on the ground, and the sheer presence and effectiveness of 
American forces has created some tactical momentum in terms of the 
security situation. But the fundamental challenge remains to get the 
policy right in Iraq, and that is the responsibility of the Government 
of Iraq. In January of this year, 2007, the President announced his 
surge and he said:




 I have made it clear to the prime minister and Iraq's other 


 leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the 


 Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, 


 it will lose the support of the American people and it 


 will lose the support of the Iraqi people.


Well, those individuals in this body who oppose the House provision, 
the changed missions, are essentially declaring that there is an open-
ended commitment; that we will not condition our resources and our 
effort in Iraq. I think that is wrong. And, in fact, it is wrong 
because what has been acknowledged over the last several days is the 
fact that the Iraqi political leaders have not seized on the situation 
in Iraq. They have not followed through.

The President proposed his surge because he thought the Government of 
Iraq would have the breathing space it needed to make progress in other 
critical areas. No such significant progress has been made. Yesterday, 
on the front page of The Washington Post, Tom Ricks wrote:




 Senior military commanders here now portray the 


 intransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated government as the 


 key threat facing




 the U.S. effort in Iraq, rather than al-Qaida terrorists, 


 Sunni insurgents, or Iranian-backed militias.


General Odierno, our tactical commander, the corps commander, 
indicated if that doesn't happen--i.e., the Government taking charge--
we are going to have to review our strategy. Well, that is not taking 
place. We have to review our strategy. Indeed, we have to change our 
strategy. We have to have a strategy with limited missions, 
counterterrorism, force protection, training Iraqi security forces. 
Those are the missions embedded in the supplemental bridge legislation 
passed by the House. Those are the missions we should pursue. Those are 
the missions that are essential to our security.

The Iraqi people, the Iraqi Government, must solve their own internal 
problems. We have given them space. They have not used it. Now we must 
seize on those mission which will protect the United States without an 
open-ended, unlimited commitment of our forces and our resources.

I urge that all of our colleagues join together in a bipartisan 
fashion and strongly support the supplemental bridge legislation 
proposed by the House, including conditions which are essential to our 
progress forward in Iraq.

I yield the floor.
