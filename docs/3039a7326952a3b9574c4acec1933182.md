Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.

The interim report released by the President today details exactly 
what I anticipated, a lack-of-progress report which demonstrates that 
the Iraqi Government has made the least progress on those key 
benchmarks that are vital to achieving stabilization.

The President at a press conference earlier today stressed the usual 
line of excuses that he has far too often utilized in the past, stating 
that we need to give General Petraeus time to show that the plus-up is 
effective and stress the importance of waiting until the September 15 
progress report is released before drawing conclusions on the policy in 
Iraq. However, the President forgot to mention that General Petraeus 
said in an interview just last month that the chances of having a 
stable Iraqi Government in place by September are slim to none. Those 
are his words.

Frankly, our troops need our support, and that support must be their 
redeployment, which will end the continued bloodshed.
