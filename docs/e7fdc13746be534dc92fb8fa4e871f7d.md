`Mr. THUNE â€” 27 June 2007`

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that seeks 
to fix a potentially devastating mistake in the U.S. Troop Readiness, 
Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability 
Appropriations Act of 2007, Public Law No. 110-28.

In May 2007, Congress passed H.R. 2206, which included much-needed 
disaster assistance for our Nation's farmers and ranchers. After much 
delay, it is critical that those producers impacted by natural 
disasters receive the assistance they need and deserve.

Over the past few years, drought conditions and other natural 
disasters have financially strained tens of thousands of agriculture 
producers across the country. Congress has responded to the needs of 
America's producers by enacting emergency disaster assistance for our 
farm and ranch families.

However, it has been brought to my attention that many livestock 
producers will likely be ineligible for assistance due to an unintended 
technicality. Congress clearly intended disaster assistance to be 
available to those producers most impacted by years of devastating 
weather conditions. This assistance includes livestock producer 
eligibility for Livestock Indemnity Payments and Livestock Compensation 
Program without participation in the Non-Insured Crop Disaster 
Assistance program, NAP, or Federal crop insurance pilot program as a 
prerequisite.

However, it is my understanding that the Department of Agriculture 
will interpret section 9012 of Public Law 110-28 as Congress intending 
that all livestock producers must have NAP or pilot crop insurance 
coverage in order to be eligible for disaster payments. If disaster 
benefits are limited to only


those livestock producers with NAP or crop insurance coverage, the vast 
majority of livestock producers in drought-stricken regions will be 
ineligible for disaster assistance.

Only a small percentage of producers participated in the NAP program, 
which only paid $1 to $2 per acre. As a result, few grazing producers 
bought policies. It is not good policy to exclude producers from 
disaster assistance who chose not to participate in what many consider 
an ineffective program.

My legislation would strike section 9012 of Public Law 110-28, and 
ensure that those producers in need of assistance receive assistance in 
a timely manner.

It is my belief that both the Senate and the House of Representatives 
should pass my bill to ensure that livestock producers are able to 
qualify for the disaster assistance that President Bush signed into law 
earlier this year.
