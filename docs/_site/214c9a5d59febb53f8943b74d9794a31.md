Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, today we received more disturbing news 
about the tremendous strain that overseas deployments have put on our 
men and women in uniform. The RAND Corporation released a study that 
found roughly one in five U.S. troops is suffering from major 
depression or post-traumatic stress as a result of serving in the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. The study also found that even more have 
suffered some form of traumatic brain injury, often considered the 
signature injury of the Iraq War.

While this trend is not new, this study confirms what we have known 
for some time: Extended tours and multiple deployments without 
sufficient down time contribute to post-traumatic stress disorder. What 
is perhaps most disturbing is the finding that only about half those 
with PTSD or depression have sought treatment, and only half again 
received minimally adequate treatment.

This means that while one in five of our men and women are suffering, 
only a quarter of those who come home with these debilitating 
conditions are receiving the treatment they need.

I've heard from veterans in my district who never sought mental 
health treatment either because it wasn't available or because there 
was a stigma attached to it. Without treatment, these veterans are at 
risk of engaging in self-destructive behavior like drinking and using 
drugs, they may have marital problems, and some even contemplate 
suicide. This is why we must take this study seriously.

These brave men and women offered to lay down their lives in defense 
of our Nation. We owe them no less than an absolute commitment to 
provide them with the support and care they need to return to healthy 
and productive civilian lives.
