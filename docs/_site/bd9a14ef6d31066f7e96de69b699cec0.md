Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to add my voice to 
others who are calling for an end to the war in Iraq. We must end this 
war and we must end it now. We cannot wait, and we must not wait.

Every month, every week, every day, every hour, every minute, every 
second, every moment that another young man OR another young woman is 
killed, their innocent blood is on all of our hands. We have a moral 
obligation, a mission and a mandate to bring this madness to an end.

Nothing, but nothing good can come out of this war. It is destroying 
Iraq and destroying the very soul of our Nation.

As Members of Congress, we must find a way to stop it and stop it 
now.
