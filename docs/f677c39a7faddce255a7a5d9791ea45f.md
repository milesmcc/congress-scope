Mr. YARMUTH. There's another element to the philosophy that I think 
we need to talk about now, and I see it in discussions that we have in 
our caucus meetings, and I think it's a growing realization that we 
have to embrace as a philosophy in this body that we can't think just 
to the next election cycle. We have to start thinking very long-term, 
and we have to start thinking about investment and investments that 
will pay off over the long run but will not get us any immediate 
gratification or recognition so that we can get votes at the next 
election.

And you mentioned health care, and that's certainly an area in which 
we have to start investing because every dollar we spend on early 
childhood health care we know pays off 10, 20 times down the road. You 
can't see it today. The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, won't 
score it and say, okay, you can take credit for that, but we know that 
it happens. If children are tended to early on, preventive care, 
diagnostic work, we catch a hearing problem, a sight problem, you catch 
them before they get obese, we know how much that returns in savings 
down the road.

The same way with infrastructure. We've neglected infrastructure in 
this country for far too long. We know we have to make investments in 
infrastructure, but those are the types of investments that do pay off. 
It's not like Iraq where every dollar, once you shoot a bullet, once 
you shoot a rocket, that's money gone. There's no investment there, no 
return on investment.

But infrastructure, health care, medical research, if we could spend, 
let's say we spent $100 billion over the next 10 years and we were to 
cure cancer and diabetes, you're the doctor, it would save trillions of 
dollars long-term.
