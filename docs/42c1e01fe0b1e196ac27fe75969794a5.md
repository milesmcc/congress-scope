Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chair, today I rise and am proud to join my 
colleagues in supporting the Castor/Bilirakis amendment to the National 
Defense Authorization Act for FY2010. This amendment would provide free 
mailing vouchers to members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, that can then be transferred to loved ones who 
will be able to send letters and packages to soldiers at no cost. While 
our


soldiers do not have to pay for the letters they send home, their 
families often spend hundreds of dollars to send care packages and 
letters of their own.

I introduced similar legislation (H.R. 704) this Congress and a 
similar provision was also included in the FY2009 National Defense 
Authorization Act that passed the House, only to be stripped out during 
conference negotiations. As someone who has long been dedicated to 
providing for the needs of soldiers and their families, I welcome this 
long-awaited addition to the benefits of those who serve our country.
