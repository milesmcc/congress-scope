Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a little more than 6 weeks ago, the Senate 
passed a supplemental appropriations bill relative to the war in Iraq. 
It contained provisions relating to the readiness of U.S. forces, such 
as ensuring U.S. military units are fully mission capable, that they 
are not deployed for combat beyond a year in the case of the Army, 7 
months in the case of the Marines; that they are not redeployed for 
combat if the unit has been deployed within a year for the Army and 7 
months for the Marines. The vetoed bill provided for a Presidential 
waiver of those limitations.

The vetoed bill also contained a very essential provision regarding 
troop reductions--first, a troop reduction requirement that would 
commence on October 1. That is the heart of the bill that was vetoed. 
We will commence finally to reduce the number of troops in Iraq instead 
of adding to the troops, instead of adding more military, instead of 
looking to a military solution, finally recognizing that there is no 
military solution, there is only a political solution in Iraq, and that 
it is up to the political leaders in Iraq to reach that conclusion.

We must put pressure on them, and the only way I know to put pressure 
on the Iraqi leaders is to tell them that the future of their country 
is in their hands, that we cannot save them from themselves, and for us 
to change the course by beginning to reduce the number of troops in a 
nonprecipitous way and to do that beginning in 180 days.

What that amendment did on the supplemental was also set a goal for 
the remainder of the troops who are going to be removed. Except for the 
limited missions that were set up, it set a goal to do that. It was not 
set in stone as to the precise moment all the troops would have to 
leave, and it avoided using the funding mechanism. We did that on 
purpose. We want to send a message to the troops that troops in Iraq, 
whatever they are, whatever are left, whatever are going to be removed 
that have not been removed at the exact moment in the Feingold 
amendment--troops are going to be supported.

We are going to support these troops. We are not going to use a 
funding mechanism to cut off funding for our troops. That was the way 
to go. We got 51 votes in the Senate for that approach. It was vetoed 
by the President.

Now we have an amendment that is pending. This amendment would 
provide essentially the same provisions: protecting our troops, funding 
our troops but also initiating the beginning of the reductions that are 
so essential to forcing the Iraqis to step to the plate and resolving 
their political differences.

This amendment that is pending, however, contains a waiver. The 
waiver provision in this amendment has caused some concern 
understandably. The only purpose for the waiver provision the President 
was given in this pending amendment was in order to avoid a veto, to 
get the funds there.

However, it will not avoid a veto. The security advisor to the 
President has told me that, as a matter of fact, the President still 
opposes it, although he has a waiver authority in this amendment. 
Because of that, it does not serve its purpose of avoiding a veto.

Because there is some confusion as to the waiver provision, as to 
whether there is any intent to weaken what we did when we passed the 
supplemental, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to withdraw my 
amendment. I understand it has been cleared on the other side. I ask 
unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and that cloture be 
vitiated.
