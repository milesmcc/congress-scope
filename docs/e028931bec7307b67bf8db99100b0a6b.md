Mr. INOUYE. It does not mandate a timetable for ending our 
involvement in Iraq but provides a new way ahead which will ensure 
better protection for our forces and a greater chance for the Iraqis to 
succeed.

This is a good, balanced package. It includes the best from each of 
our bills. It funds the critical needs of our military and provides a 
way ahead for our forces in Iraq.

I urge all my colleagues to support this conference agreement.

I thank the Chair.
