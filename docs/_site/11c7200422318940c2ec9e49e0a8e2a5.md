# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `11c7200422318940c2ec9e49e0a8e2a5`
`Mr. SHERMAN â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to assume the Democratic time.

I would just comment to the gentleman from Florida that if he would 
join with us in voting for this resolution, then we will avoid the 
crises of the Constitution that he talks about and, instead, we will 
shock this President into giving us a new direction in Iraq.
