Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the recent debate of the Defense 
authorization bill, we saw attempt after attempt to declare the new 
strategy, General Petraeus' strategy, in Iraq a failure. The other side 
of the aisle wanted to declare that the strategy, which had been in 
full force only a couple of weeks, had failed and direct the President 
to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq, which is today the central front 
in the war against terrorists. Indeed, after the other side lost a vote 
to withdraw the troops, the majority leader pulled the bill from the 
floor, thus leaving important business for our military unfinished.

The Democratic majority's insistence that the General Petraeus' 
strategy has failed makes it easy to overlook what the strategy has 
accomplished and what the strategy seeks to accomplish.

In that regard, I ask unanimous consent to have an article by Michael 
Gordon from New York Times of July 24 printed in the Record.
