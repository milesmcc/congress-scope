`Mr. PRICE of North Carolina â€” 28 July 2010`

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, this bill provides a total of $701 million to support 
high-priority Homeland Security and Justice programs to enhance 
security along the Southwest border, where violence on the Mexican side 
is intensifying due to turf battles among murderous transnational 
criminal organizations competing for drug, alien, and weapons 
trafficking business. The funding would enable DHS and DOJ, in 
cooperation with the National Guard, to build on the current border 
enforcement surge.

This bill is largely uncontroversial. It simply re-proposes funding 
the House already approved as part of the war and disaster supplemental 
bill on July 1. As we all know, these funds, along with funds to stop 
teacher layoffs, were stripped by the Senate, leaving only funding for 
the wars, the Disaster Relief Fund, and Haiti earthquake relief. This 
funding is required now to improve security on our border and in our 
border communities.

I want to thank the dedicated Members from the Southwest border 
region who have kept the focus on this issue and are responsible for 
bringing us here today. We will hear from a good number of these 
Members tonight. I especially want to thank Gabby Giffords and 
Silvestre Reyes for their effort leadership on this effort, along with 
Ciro Rodriguez, a member of our subcommittee who is a tireless advocate 
of these border communities; Alan Mollohan, who helped shape the 
Department of Justice items in the bill; and many others who helped 
substantially: Chet Edwards, Ann Kirkpatrick, Harry Teague, Henry 
Cuellar, Solomon Ortiz, Ruben Hinojosa, Susan Davis, and Gene Green, 
among others.

Very briefly, the bill would fund several critical initiatives, 
including 1,200 new border patrol agents to sustain current levels on 
the Southwest border and build up capacity for when the National Guard 
is withdrawn next year, and 500 new Customs and Border Protection 
officers for the Southwest border to keep up staffing at ports of entry 
as customs and immigration fee funding continues to fall.

The bill includes funding for integrity programs to ensure CBP 
personnel operate at the high standards we expect and to combat efforts 
by the cartels to corrupt CBP personnel.

The bill would fund three new forward operating bases and better 
tactical communications to enable the border patrol to operate close to 
the border and to close gaps that can be exploited by smugglers.

It would establish four new Border Enforcement Security Task Forces 
on the border and build up a permanent ICE presence in joint 
counterdrug efforts in the region, as well as provide for a surge in 
ICE's criminal alien removal efforts.

It would add $50 million to expand support for State and local joint 
law enforcement efforts on the border.

It would add two additional Predator unmanned aircraft systems to 
ensure better coverage of the Southwest border, in particular on the 
Texas border.

And finally, it provides $201 million for Justice Department staffing 
to surge agents and U.S. attorneys to high-crime areas in the Southwest 
border region, to provide more robust assistance to Mexican law 
enforcement authorities, and to better handle criminal aliens referred 
by the Department of Homeland Security.

On June 22 of this year, the President requested a $600 million 
border security supplemental, offsetting $100 million of these funds 
and designating the rest as an emergency.



This bill is consistent with that request, funding $500 million under 
an emergency designation and offsetting $201 million from unobligated 
balances in TSA Aviation Security, FEMA Administrative and Regional 
Operations, the Census Bureau, and CBP's delayed virtual fence effort, 
or SBInet.

Consistent with past practices for supplemental appropriations, we 
consider our challenges on the southwest border as important as our 
military's work to secure Afghanistan from the Taliban or to promote 
stability in Iraq, and some would argue that the southwest border 
mission is more important. That's why this President, like past 
Presidents, has requested the funding under an emergency designation. I 
know the minority has agreed with this point of view repeatedly in the 
past, and I hope we can count on their support now.

Mr. Speaker, this bill will help us counter the pressures on our law 
enforcement agencies and our border communities, and I urge my 
colleagues to adopt it.

I reserve the balance of my time.
