# IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL--THE WRONG WAY FORWARD

Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the Democrats' Iraq supplemental bill is the 
wrong policy for America and the wrong signal to send our troops in 
harm's way.

The Democrats' attempt to micromanage the war accomplishes nothing of 
strategic value. Rather, by meddling in the decisions which are best 
left to our commanders on the ground, they merely succeeded in 
telegraphing our plans to the enemy.

Setting deadlines and tying the hands of our generals is not a plan 
for success and not a safe way to conduct this war. Congress, an 
inherent political body, should not be dictating military strategy. 
Rather than support a bill that leaves our troops in harm's way for a 
cause Democrats believe cannot be won, a bill the President has 
promised to veto, the Democratic leaders should be willing to vote up 
or down on a clean bill that supports funding the global war on 
terrorism.
