Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Atanacio Marin, or as he was better known, Nacho, by his friends, 
typifies the soldiers that come from California. So many of them are 
from Los Angeles and surrounding areas, so many have stories like Nacho 
has: one in which he was born in Mexico; one in which his family came 
here for a better life; one in which he became integrated with the 
community that he grew up in; one in which he graduated from Sierra 
Vista High School and was on the track team and ran in the Los Angeles 
marathon; one in which he had a desire to serve his country; one in 
which he joined the National Guard after completing high school and 
decided to devote his life to serving the military.

After his tour with the National Guard ended, Nacho transferred to 
the regular Army and was assigned to Battery C, 3rd Battalion, 16th 
Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. In January, 2 months 
before reporting for duty in the Middle East, Sergeant Marin was able 
to spend time with his close-knit family. While he was in Iraq he 
continued to remain close to his family. He called home often and 
characteristically sent his mother a Mother's Day card that read, 
''Don't worry, be happy.'' Tragically, those uplifting words were some 
of his last.

A checkpoint was manned by the sergeant and came under fire on June 
3, 2003. Unfortunately, this brave young man did not survive the 
attack. He was only 27 years old.

The post office we are naming today in Baldwin Park we are naming not 
just as a tribute to this fine soldier, but as a tribute to those who 
have gone to serve their country in this war and, like so many others, 
have an American story.

Nacho's American story is the story of California, it is a story of 
the war that is not often talked on this front, of patriotism, of 
devotion to family, of devotion to this Nation. And it is so 
appropriate that we name a post office after this fine young man from 
California. So I join with the majority in urging its swift passage.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
