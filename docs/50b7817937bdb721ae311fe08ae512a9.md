`Mr. LAUTENBERG â€” 16 November 2007`

---


Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, another month has passed, and more 
American troops lost their lives overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. It 
is only right that we take a few moments in the Senate to honor them.

Since last memorializing the names of our fallen troops on October 
24, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 72 troops. They lost their 
lives in Iraq and in Operation Enduring Freedom, which includes 
Afghanistan. One Defense Department civilian was also killed. They will 
not be forgotten. So today I will submit their names into the Record:

We cannot forget these brave men and women. The Nation cannot afford 
to forget their sacrifice. We have to remember that these brave souls 
left behind parents and children, siblings, friends. Those left behind 
will feel their sorrow forever. We want them to know the country thinks 
about them, and we make a pledge to preserve their memory with the 
dignity that those who served and paid this price deserve.
