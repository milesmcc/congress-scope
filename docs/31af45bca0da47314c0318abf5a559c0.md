Mr. McCAIN. So in what the American people believed was a time of 
change, the American people now should know that it is business as 
usual. A combination of lobbyists, industry campaign contributions, 
unnecessary spending continues completely out of control. This was a 
piece of legislation that was supposed to fund the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. So now we add billions of dollars for things such as cash 
for clunkers, unneeded and unnecessary and unwanted military equipment 
that is made in the home States of certain powerful Members of 
Congress.

It is not good. Sooner or later, the American people will demand that 
it comes to an end.

I yield the floor.
