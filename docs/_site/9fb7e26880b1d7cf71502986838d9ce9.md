Mr. KUCINICH. Four years ago this week, in violation of international 
law, standing upon a mountain of lies, the United States went to war 
against the people of Iraq. The U.S. now has a moral responsibility for 
the deaths of as many as 1 million innocent Iraqis, for the destruction 
of Iraq and the theft of billions in Iraq oil assets.

Those who told lies to take us into war should be held accountable 
under the U.S. Constitution and at the International Criminal Court. 
Instead of true accountability on the war, the President and the Vice 
President could get over $100 billion to keep the war going through the 
end of their term. More war, more civilian deaths, more soldiers killed 
or maimed. Less money for housing, for health care, for education, for 
seniors as we borrow money from Beijing to fight a war in Baghdad.

Instead of accountability, the appropriations bill will mandate the 
privatization of $6 trillion in Iraqi oil assets and provide money 
which can be used to attack Iran to try to grab another $7 trillion in 
Iranian oil assets for the oil companies.

Support the troops. Stop the war. End the occupation. Support H.R. 
1234.
