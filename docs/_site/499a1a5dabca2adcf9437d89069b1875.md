Mr. GRAHAM. The last thought about that: I think our memory, the 
event that we need to remember is even later than 9/11. It is actually 
in Iraq. I remember very well this whole debate, and I would urge this 
administration not to do what the last administration did. That is 
exactly what is going on in Afghanistan right now. It is as if we have 
learned nothing.

It is clear, just as it was in Iraq, that we did not have enough 
combat power to secure the country, not enough mentoring programs to 
actually train the Iraqi Army, and only when we changed the strategy of 
adding more troops and gave the Iraqi people and the army some 
breathing space, the politicians, from the violence did things change. 
It is exactly the same thing here.

But right now we have a dynamic on the ground that is not much 
different from Iraq the first 3 years after the fall of Saddam Hussein. 
It is clear that Admiral Mullen recognizes that. The new strategy in 
March is a counterinsurgency strategy, and Senator McCain, the one 
thing I remember is numbers matter. We need enough troops per 
population center to effect change, and we do not have the ratios to 
enact an effective counterinsurgency strategy unless we add more 
troops, and that means more than just trainers.

So my frustration is, as you said yesterday: We have seen this movie 
before. We are putting 68,000 troops in harm's way, and unless we 
properly resource them, give them more assistance, more people to help 
them fight, they are not going to change the battle momentum, and they 
are going to get killed in the process.

There is not enough people to effect the counterinsurgency strategy, 
just like there was not enough in Iraq. Have we learned nothing? So 
let's act.

Mr. President, we will support you to the nth degree to get the 
combat power and the trainers and the civilians into Afghanistan to 
turn this place around. But the sooner you act, the quicker we


can do it, and the sooner we will come home and the less lives we will 
lose in the long run. That is our message.

We respect you. You are the Commander in Chief. You won the election. 
But you have an opportunity, and it is clear to me that we are losing 
momentum. This is not a time to deliberate. This is a time to act.
