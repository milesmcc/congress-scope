# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `50dd3b4fd25e859d9bea4d0055ad7fad`
`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 14 February 2007`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, my uncle said a generation ago: If we 
examine the history of the conflict, we find the dismal story repeated 
time after time. Every time, at every crisis, we have denied that 
anything was wrong; sent more troops; and issued more confident 
communiques. Every time, we have been assured that this one last step 
would bring victory. And every time, the predictions and promises have 
failed and been forgotten, and the demand has been made once again for 
just one more step up the ladder. And once again the President tells us 
that we are going to win; victory is coming.''

My Uncle Robert Kennedy made this statement in March of 1968. It took 
another 5 years and 37,455 American lives before a United States 
President was withdrawing Americans out of Vietnam and stopping that 
war.

I am here tonight to say that the American people and this Congress 
are going to say ''no'' to this President when it comes to repeating 
that mistake.

There are those who will disparage this amendment and who say that 
this is a nonbinding resolution. But this resolution says that we are 
going to reject this President's doubling down on the gambling of 
American lives, and this foolish policy which has sent over 3,125 
soldiers to their deaths, over 23,417 wounded soldiers back home, and 
hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis to their graves and countless 
more also injured.

We are saying in this resolution that we either have to start digging 
ourselves out of this hole, or we are going to start rueing the day 
when we have failed to act tonight to start changing course.



This administration's bullheaded insistence, bullheaded insistence on 
ideology over strategy is what has gotten us into this mess, and now 
that same stubbornness is counseling us to send still more soldiers and 
more Marines into an Iraqi civil war.

Our service men and women have been heroic. They have been confronted 
with repeated civilian failures of leadership, ill equipped and under 
equipped, and yet in increasingly untenable positions they have been 
unflinching and have been uncomplaining in their shouldering of every 
burden we have asked of them, and they have done it with dignity and 
professionalism. But it is not right. It is not right to ask them, to 
ask the military to bear the burden of the responsibility of solving 
someone else's civil war. It is not right, and it won't work.

Instead of closing our eyes and crossing our fingers and giving this 
President a rubber stamp for an endless civil war in Iraq, we should be 
beginning to move our country back to a common-sense policy of strength 
through leadership.

Our choice tonight is clear: Keep digging, or climb our way out of 
this hole. I think this Congress will decide to start climbing our way 
out.

And there will be many who will say, what will we do then? I will 
say, well, maybe we will propose to fence off the funds as many have 
suggested. That will be a debate for another day. That will be a debate 
for another day whether we will fence off the funds. But tonight will 
be the debate, and tomorrow will be the decision as to whether we will 
vote to go in that direction.

So you can say it is a meaningless, nonbinding resolution all you 
want, but it is the first conversation as to which direction we are 
going to go, and that is the direction we have to decide, and I vote 
that we go in the direction of starting to move our way and our troops 
out of Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, ''if we examine the history of the conflict, we find the 
dismal story repeated time after time. Every time--at every crisis--we 
have denied that anything was wrong; sent more troops; and issued more 
confident communiques. Every time, we have been assured that this one 
last step would bring victory. And every time, the predictions and 
promises have failed and been forgotten, and the demand has been made 
again for just one more step up the ladder. . . . And once again the 
President tells us that 'we are going to win'; 'victory' is coming.''

My uncle, Robert Kennedy, spoke these words in March 1968, It took 
another 5 years and another 37,455 American lives before a U.S. 
President finally withdrew American troops from Vietnam.

I will not stand by, the American people will not stand by, and allow 
the President to repeat that mistake.

Some disparage this resolution because it's nonbinding. But with due 
respect, I couldn't disagree more. This resolution represents a 
fundamental policy choice by this Congress.

It's about whether you agree with doubling down the President's high 
stakes gamble with American lives.

This resolution poses a simple choice. After 4 years, after 3,125 
deaths, after more than 23,417 wounded, are we digging our hole in Iraq 
even deeper, or are we strong enough to start climbing out?

We need a stronger America, a more secure America and that begins 
with a rejection of the failed strategy in Iraq.

It has now been nearly 4 years since the President declared that in 
Iraq, our mission was accomplished.

Four years of disintegration. Four years of unfounded insistence that 
the turning point is right around the corner.

Are we digging deeper, or climbing out?

We have watched a child hug their parents tight on the tarmac--only 
to have to let go as Morn or Dad is deployed for the second, third, or 
even fourth time.

We have stood at the graveside with a grieving family as a Gold Star 
mother accepts a folded American flag.

We have visited our Nation's newest veterans in the hospital, their 
bodies and minds scarred by the horrors of war.

Are we digging deeper, or climbing out?

Each day we all see, with our own eyes, the carnage and the chaos 
that has become the norm in Iraq.

The administration's bull-headed insistence on ideology over strategy 
has led us to where we are today. And now, that same stubbornness is 
counseling some to send still more of our soldiers and marines into an 
Iraqi civil war.

Our current course is failing in Iraq. It's failing the bigger 
struggle against our terrorist enemies. It's failing our troops and 
their families. And it's failing our core values as Americans.

I won't settle for that failure. We must change course. We must begin 
to climb out of the hole in Iraq.

Democrats, Republicans, generals, and most importantly, the American 
people now see that it is time for a new plan; it is time to embrace a 
new approach.

Our service men and women have been heroic. Confronted with repeated 
civilian failures of leadership, underequipped, and in an increasingly 
untenable position, our troops have not flinched, they have not 
complained, they have shouldered every burden we ask of them with 
dignity and professionalism.

But it is not right to place upon our military the responsibility of 
solving someone else's civil war. It's not right, and it won't work.

Instead of closing our eyes, crossing our fingers, and giving the 
President a rubber stamp for endless war in Iraq, we should begin 
moving our country back to a commonsense policy of strength through 
leadership.

Our strong leaders of the last century, like Presidents Roosevelt, 
Truman, Kennedy, and Reagan, recognized that while American military 
might was important, American values were our greatest strength.

We rallied the world in the Second World War and defeated the Soviets 
in the cold war on the strength of our Nation's democratic ideals. For 
the entire 20th century, we led by our example, and by the force of our 
principles.

While military action will continue to be a necessary component of 
our current struggle, ultimate victory against this generation of 
enemies will similarly be won not on the battlefield, but in the minds 
of millions around the world. That victory is impossible while we are 
in the middle of Iraq's civil war.

Our choice today is clear. Keep digging or climb out? If we decide to 
begin climbing out, as I think we will, there are debates yet to come 
about the best way to do that--whether we should fence off funds to 
prevent an escalation, for example. I look forward to those 
conversations. But today is a more fundamental question about the 
direction of our country.

We can withdraw from Iraq without withdrawing from the fight. We can 
be strong enough to climb out of that hole. For our troops, for their 
families, and for our Nation's strength and security, I urge a ''yes'' 
vote.
