Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman will yield further, by 
no means was I suggesting we should not be doing that. In fact, that is 
a discussion for another day. What I was suggesting is that there are 
many places where we are increasing spending even more dramatically 
than is suggested by the gentleman's amendment here for what I believe 
is a vitally important purpose, which is democracy, rule of law and 
governance in Iraq.
