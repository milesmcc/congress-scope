Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, 
and thanks to Mr. Skelton, the outstanding Congressman from Missouri.

I rise to support H.R. 2956. If we could stop this war today, it 
would please my constituents. And if we could do it without more 
violence, I would be picketing to do it.

All of us know, that have any common sense, that we cannot bring the 
troops home today, but we can develop a good strategy to make sure that 
they get the message in Iraq that we are coming home. We still have 
150,336 troops over there. Are we going to stay until they all get 
killed?

We talk about how many have lost lives. I was a nurse in the 
Veterans' Administration for 15 years, and I saw the damaged lives of 
these veterans coming home from war. What are we doing for ourselves 
and the future? This is not a partisan issue, this is an issue that 
saves America.

Mr. Speaker, the most recent report from the Department of Defense, 
states there are 150,336 brave American troops in the middle of a 
violent civil war in Iraq.

Meanwhile, the President has repeatedly made it clear that nothing 
will discourage him from pursuing a war that has no end in sight.

Congress cannot and should not keep waiting for the President to 
change course.

We must change the course ourselves, 2008 must be a year of 
transition in Iraq. Iraq has to grow out of the shadow of the United 
States.

Iraq needs to take responsibility for its own decisions, learn from 
its own mistakes, and find its own solutions to its own problems.

Recently, the Iraq Study Group suggested that the time has since 
passed when one country alone could work alongside the Iraqi leadership 
to steer Iraq's future.

Rather, as the report says, ''the United States should immediately 
launch a New Diplomatic Offensive to build an international consensus 
for stability in Iraq and the region.''

This recommendation is perhaps the last- best hope for war weary 
Iraqis and Americans alike.

Mr. Speaker, our brave men and women are serving with great honor in 
Iraq. Their service has paved the way for a democratic society.

It is time for the Iraqi government to stand up, so our troops can 
begin to stand-down.

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
