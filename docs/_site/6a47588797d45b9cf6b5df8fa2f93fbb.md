Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 
I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly the gentleman from 
Missouri, in the consideration of H.R. 6169, which names a postal 
facility in Baldwin, Missouri, after a fallen hero, Specialist Peter J. 
Navarro.

Introduced on June 3, 2008, H.R. 6169 is sponsored by Congressman 
Todd Akin, representative of Missouri's Second Congressional District, 
and co-sponsored by Missouri's entire congressional delegation and a 
total of eight Members of Congress. H.R. 6169 was reported from the 
Oversight Committee on July 16, 2008 by a voice vote.

Upon graduating from Lafayette High School in Wildwood, Missouri, 
Specialist Peter J. Navarro was assigned to the Army's 2nd Battalion 
and served in that capacity as an outstanding member of his regiment. 
While conducting combat operations, an improvised explosion device was 
detonated near his Humvee, killing the 20-year-old.

His mother had asked him not to return to Iraq, but being the 
dedicated soldier that he was, Specialist Navarro returned because he 
believed in the mission. Described as a strong willed and caring young 
man, Specialist Peter J. Navarro served his country in Iraq with pride 
and distinction. In honor of this sacrifice, Mr. Speaker, let us also 
pay tribute to the life of Specialist Navarro and pass H.R. 6169 and 
designate the Manchester Road Post Office Building in Baldwin, 
Missouri, after this fine and outstanding American soldier.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
