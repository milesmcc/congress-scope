`Mr. REID â€” 19 December 2009`

---


Mr. REID. To my friend from Texas, whom I care about a great deal--
she is a member of the Appropriations Committee. I am disappointed she 
spent all morning not talking about the bill before us; namely, the 
bill that is going to fund our troops. That is why she is here. It is 
just after 7 in the morning in Washington. It is just after 4 a.m. in 
Nevada. Those watching around the United States may be wondering why we 
are voting at this rare hour, early on a Saturday morning, in what is 
shaping up to be the worst snowstorm in Washington's history.

The reason is very simple. We have work to do. We are going to 
support the troops, to make sure they have all the resources they need. 
I am confident my Republican colleagues will join with us in that 
regard.

I also say to my friend from Texas and others, it is as if they are 
in some other universe. First of all, we offered a unanimous consent 
request as soon as these proceedings started dealing with health care. 
I said:




 I ask unanimous consent that no amendment be in order to 


 the Reid substitute amendment . . . unless the text . . . of 


 the amendment is posted on the home page of the official 


 Senate Web site of the Member of the Senate who is sponsoring 


 the amendment prior to the amendment being called up for 


 consideration by the Senate and the amendment is filed at the 


 desk. Further, that this unanimous consent request be in 


 effect for the duration of the consideration of [this bill].


That is pretty direct. Offer an amendment and people should be able 
to see it. Guess what. The Republicans objected to that. Here is 
exactly what the senior Senator from Wyoming said:




 In light of some of the trust problems and transparency 


 problems we have, while this appears to lead to greater 


 transparency . . . I object.


Something that creates transparency, they object because it does not 
create transparency.

Let me just say, we are going to finish this Defense bill. We are 
going to move on, at the appropriate time, and vote on the so-called 
managers' package, which will save lives--along with the other bill 
that is now before the Senate on health care--save money, and save 
Medicare. There are immediate deliverables.


I don't know what in the world the Senator from Texas was talking 
about. Something that is picked up on talk radio? I don't know. But it 
is not anything that deals with reality. We are going to do away with 
preexisting disabilities. The letters we receive from around the 
country, what insurance companies do is incredible. We will insure 31 
million new people--pretty good, 31 million. Thousands of primary care 
physicians will be created and thousands of community health centers, 
which we should have been doing a long time ago.

I can remember, as a new Senator, that seat right there in the back 
of the Chamber was held by the famous Pat Moynihan. We were, at that 
time, dealing with homelessness. That was the issue of the day. He 
turned around to me, a new Senator, and said: This is ridiculous. The 
reason there are so many homeless is because we did not do our job. 
When the insane asylums, the mental institutions were emptied, because 
we had medicine that would take care of these people in institutions, 
part of the deal was we would have community health centers to have 
them come and get their medication, have them taken care of. We didn't 
do that, and that is why we have so many homeless people. This bill is 
going to alleviate most of that.

We have something in this legislation called the CLASS Act, which 
will offer for the first time in the history of this country for people 
who are working to plan ahead in case they become disabled. It is fully 
paid for. CBO said, in the far future, decades and decades into the 
future, it is paid for. I did not use a penny of that money for the 
bill that is before the Senate.

Again, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I am sorry 
this has been such a method of just saying no to everything--
everything, everything. It is too bad we didn't have a little more 
help. We received none. We hope they will join with us, the minority, 
as did the Republicans in the House of Representatives, and support the 
troops, 395 to 34. Out of 435 Members, only 34 voted against that bill. 
Democrats and Republicans--overwhelming majorities--over 90 percent of 
Democrats and Republicans in that


House supported that bill. That is what we need to do in a show of good 
faith for the men and women fighting around the world.

For example, in Afghanistan, I read the morning news from Nevada. The 
Nevada National Guard, in the mountains of Afghanistan, had a vicious 
firefight lasting more than a day, chasing these evil people through 
villages. Many of them were killed. One Nevadan was wounded. That is 
what this legislation before this body is about.

I hope we can do what needs to be done.

Mr. President, I move to table the motion to concur in the House 
amendment to the Senate amendment with amendments, and I ask for the 
yeas and nays.
