Mr. POMEROY. Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in 
this Special Order. I want to congratulate you and all who have 
impacted the national defense authorization bill we will be voting on 
towards the end of the week.

You know, the principles of sound budgeting have got to apply to the 
administration of our government, and that means all facets of our 
government. We have had leadership at the White House that has 
basically said we can have a war, and we are going to have it off 
budget. We don't have to account for it in terms of our efforts toward 
reaching a balanced budget, our efforts in terms of reducing the 
deficit. We are going to have it off budget.



All it means is our kids are picking up every nickel of this war, as 
it goes straight on the national debt. That is why I appreciate the 
principles advanced by the Blue Dogs in H. Res. 97, the Operation Iraqi 
Freedom Cost Accountability Act, and I applaud you and all who worked 
so hard to get major portions of it included in the Defense 
Authorization Act.

The four significant provisions of the bill: transparency in how the 
war funds are being spent. This isn't a black-box proposition. The 
money is appropriated; the money flows. Where does it flow?

I believe we have at the rate of $2 billion per-week burn rate, we 
are entitled to know. We are entitled to know in much greater detail 
than we have had before. The Blue Dogs would go so far as to have a 
Truman Commission looking at war profiteering.

If in the depths of World War II, the face-down with Hitler, we could 
recognize that there were inappropriate funds being spent and worked to 
get a handle around them, as Senator Truman led with his committee, 
certainly the same holds true with the war on terror and with Operation 
Iraqi Freedom.

There is a book that I recommend and bring to your attention, 
''Imperial Life in the Emerald City.'' It is an outstanding inside 
account of the administration of the Green Zone in the early days after 
the conflict and into this postwar period in Iraq. It will raise in 
your mind, as it has raised in mine, any number of deep and troubling 
questions about how this whole matter has been administered, and that 
goes to war contracting, and that means we need to take a thorough look 
at all of that.

Part three of H. Res. 97, running the future funding of this war 
through the regular appropriations process, a principle adopted now 
both in the budget and the Defense Authorization Act, and the fourth 
essential component of this bill, moving greater Iraqi responsibility 
for their policing and security.

Now we have a unanimous vote of the Armed Services Committee with the 
defense authorization bill, and I believe the Blue Dogs can be very 
happy that the principle of funding this war through the normal 
appropriations process and greater transparency in how the funds are 
spent will be the policy of this House, a policy adopted I am happy to 
say with bipartisan measures.

The essential management goals for this war will have to be 
established by the Department of Defense, and the Special Inspector 
General for Iraq Reconstruction will have a much greater say in 
bringing information on the expenditure of these dollars to this body. 
There have been efforts, frankly, to hamstring the Inspector General. 
We make clear in this legislation that the Inspector General's 
authority goes towards reconstruction funding regardless of the source 
or the fiscal year. We need to expand our efforts to get a handle on 
how in the world we have spent to date nearly $400 billion, and the tab 
flowing just as fast as ever.

I think that this represents an important Blue Dog accomplishment. I 
look forward to voting on the defense authorization bill. Rather than 
take further time, I ask that Jim Marshall, a member of the Ranger Hall 
of Fame, a member of the defense authorization committee, be one that 
might further expand in this area. Obviously, his credentials are 
extremely well established.

I would just conclude by saying that the Blue Dogs have stood for 
accounting principles and solid budgeting in the administration of this 
war, and we have prevailed with the bill coming out of the Armed 
Services Committee.
