Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, one question to the distinguished ranking 
member. Where were you when we had, first, Iraq and then Afghanistan, 
and it came to paying for those endeavors which account for by far the 
biggest growth in spending in the discretionary accounts. There were no 
spending caps at that particular point in time.

I yield for a brief response.
