Mrs. DAHLKEMPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the brave men 
and women who have served their country in uniform, many of them in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude for putting their lives on 
the line for our country. However, I believe that we must show our 
gratitude, not only with our words, but with our actions.

That is why I am pleased that all eligible veterans can now take 
advantage of the 21st-Century GI Bill. Any member of the military who 
has served on active duty since September 11, 2001, can receive up to 4 
years of college tuition, including money for housing and books. 
Eligible veterans include activated Reservist and members of the 
National Guard. And as of last Friday, they can apply online at the 
VA's Web site.

This new GI Bill will open up doors for thousands of veterans 
throughout western Pennsylvania and across the country, and I encourage 
all our veterans to go online immediately to take advantage of the 
benefits they have earned.

I offer my sincere gratitude to all who have served our Nation, both 
our soldiers and their families.
