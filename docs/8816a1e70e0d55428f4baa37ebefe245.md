# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS

`Mr. SHELBY â€” 29 March 2007`

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today, just a few minutes ago, we voted on 
the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I voted against the 
bill.

From the beginning, I have tried to support our troops both morally 
and materially. It has always been my goal to ensure that our Armed 
Forces have a clearly defined mission, realistic military objectives, 
and the best equipment available. Yet, today, I believe we have reached 
a point where political infighting has led to bartering for bullets. We 
have tied vital military funding for our troops to an arbitrary date of 
withdrawal.

The Senate, with this vote today--passing this supplemental spending 
bill with a date of withdrawal--has named the date for defeat in Iraq, 
if it were to stand. We have taken a step backward. We have put an 
arbitrary deadline on our military. It is the wrong message at the 
wrong time. Surely, this will embolden the enemy and will not help our 
troops in any way. It is a big mistake.

I hope the President will veto this bill as soon as he gets it to his 
desk. I


did not support this supplemental because I remain committed to our 
troops, first and foremost.

I yield the floor.
