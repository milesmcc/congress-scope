Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to offer H.R. 3159, a bipartisan bill to 
mandate minimum periods of rest, training and recuperation for units 
and members of the regular and Reserve components of our Armed Forces 
between deployment. Fixing our troops' unpredictable rest and 
retraining policy is long overdue.

In an interview last Monday, Marine Corps Commander General James 
Conway highlighted repeated deployments and short periods of time 
between them to rest as factors contributing to increased mental stress 
and burdens on families of service men and women.

As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am intimately 
acquainted with how this war has damaged our national security, our 
diplomatic standing and the readiness of our military; and, as a 
Californian, I am well aware of how it is draining the defense and 
security resources of my home State and others.

As we speak, a unit from Walnut Creek, California, in my district, is 
leading a task force comprised of six units that come from armories 
throughout the East Bay and Northern California. The California Army 
National Guard indicates that the unit of 824 soldiers is the largest 
single California National Guard unit to be deployed since the Korean 
War. These are men and women who will benefit from this legislation in 
real time.

We are sending more and more men and women to Iraq every day. The 
Bush administration is failing to accurately account for all of the 
costs of these repeated deployments. On the microlevel, our deployed 
men and women are being taken away from their families in a revolving 
door of service because the war has gone on much longer than the 
President believed it would. And on a larger scale, we are damaging the 
readiness for our Armed Forces to defend against future attacks here at 
home and around the world, as well as national emergencies here at 
home.

Mr. Speaker, my bill simply states that if a unit or a member of a 
regular


component of the Armed Forces deploys to Iraq, they will have an 
equivalent amount of time at home before they are redeployed. No unit 
or member of a Reserve component, including the National Guard, could 
be redeployed to Iraq within 3 years of their previous deployment. In 
the event of an operational emergency posing a threat to vital national 
security interests, the President may waive the amendment's limitations 
by certifying to Congress that deployment of the unit or a member is 
necessary for national security.

The military departments also are provided waiver authority in the 
bill for individual volunteers who seek to redeploy before the 
expiration of the mandated time of rest between the deployments. This 
bill in no way, shape or form hinders the Commander in Chief's ability 
to manage military personnel.

Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we come together and take a very 
critical step to preserve the readiness of our men and women in uniform 
for them and for our national security.

If we are honest about wanting to support our troops, there is no 
better place to start than to correct our troop rotation policy. For 
far too long, the members of the Guard and Reserve have been 
unrepresented in Congress. Today, every Member has an opportunity to 
help them.

Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters of support for my bill 
from the Reserve Enlisted Association and Veterans for America.
