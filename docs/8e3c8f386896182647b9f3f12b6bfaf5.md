Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I want to put something on our minds.

When President Obama, head of the executive branch of our Federal 
Government and as an invited guest speaker of the House of 
Representatives, has his remarks interrupted in defiance of the rules 
of the House by a Member of this House, shouting ''you lie''--and no 
amount of apology can remove the scar on this House's dignity--when the 
commander of the United States forces in Afghanistan--General 
McChrystal--and his subordinates feel free to make mocking criticisms 
of their Commander in Chief, Barack Obama, to the national media and 
when these acts of disrespect and insubordination are openly directed 
at President Obama, our Nation has entered into an era of negativity 
and cynicism unprecedented in this Republic's history.

Only one question comes immediately and painfully to mind with these 
outrageous words and accusations, which would once have been 
universally deplored and which would have been far beyond and beneath 
the pale of what Americans and America are all about.
