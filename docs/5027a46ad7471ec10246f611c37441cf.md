Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, heading into our last work week, 
Republicans remain focused on the two principles that have guided us 
all year: protecting and defending the country from harm and protecting 
taxpayers' wallets. In these last few days, we will face some of the 
most crucial tests of the year on both fronts.

On security, Senate Republicans will amend the House version of the 
Appropriations bill to include funding for the troops in Iraq. Our men 
and women in uniform deserve our support wherever they are serving.

These funds are dangerously overdue. Delaying them further could put 
the Pentagon in serious straits and potentially jeopardize the 
universally acknowledged gains of the Petraeus plan.

We will also need to act wisely on reforming the FISA law that lets 
our intelligence agents track terrorists overseas. The success of this 
law over the last several years should be obvious to everyone.

The Intelligence Committee has produced a bill that would retain its 
core strengths; that has broad bipartisan support; and that, with 
slight modification, the President would sign into law. We need to act 
on this version of the revision without any political games.

On protecting taxpayers, we have two major pieces of legislation to 
finish: AMT, and a fiscally responsible omnibus bill.

A quarter of the way into the fiscal year, we have passed 1 of 12 
Appropriations bills from last year.

We need to evaluate this omnibus and make sure it is written in a 
form the President will sign. That means funding for our forces in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, no excess spending, and no poison pills in the 
form of politically motivated policy riders.

Crucially, we also need to assure middle-class Americans we are not 
going to raise their taxes or further delay their tax refunds. The 
House needs to patch the AMT tax that now threatens 23 million 
taxpayers it was never meant to affect, and they need to do so without 
raising other taxes on these households.

We saw last week we could get legislation out the door when we work 
together. After Republican insistence, we passed an energy bill without 
raising taxes or utility rates. We will need to repeat that effort this 
week on several issues that lie at the very heart of our 
responsibilities to the American people.

We need to ensure the safety of our citizens. We need to keep them 
from being hit by new and unnecessary taxes.

We will need to do all this and act on several important executive 
nominations. New week. Much to do. America's watching. Let's get to 
work.
