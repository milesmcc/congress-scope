`Mr. LYNCH â€” 5 February 2007`

Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in 
the consideration of H.R. 577, legislation naming a postal facility in 
Austin, Texas, after Staff Sergeant Henry Ybarra III.

On September 11, 2003, Sergeant Ybarra died in Iraq, performing 
maintenance on a heavy expanded mobility tactical truck when a tire 
exploded. He was serving in the Army's 6th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Unit 
when he was killed at the young age of 32.

Born in Austin, Texas, Sergeant Ybarra grew up wanting to be just 
like


his father and serve in the military. At age 19 he enlisted in the Army 
and fulfilled his dream.

Sergeant Ybarra served as a technical supply clerk, keeping track of 
spare parts for the squadron, which was not an easy task since spare 
parts are often scarce during times of conflict.

Sergeant Ybarra was known for his upbeat attitude, his contagious 
smile, and strong devotion to the Catholic faith. He is survived by his 
wife and three children.

Staff Sergeant Ybarra's service to our country should be remembered 
and celebrated by this small tribute, and I urge swift passage of this 
bill.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
