Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I support the troops wholeheartedly and 
without reservation, but I cannot support a resolution that simply 
opposes a new strategy without offering an alternative plan to win. 
There is too much at stake.

Many of you know that I was a cop in the Seattle area for 33 years. I 
was the sheriff for 8 years. And as the sheriff I had an opportunity to 
attend a remarkable ceremony. Every year a group of naturalized 
American citizens gathered to remember the circumstances of their 
arrival in the United States.

The group is comprised of police officers from Vietnam, men that 
fought side by the side with our American soldiers. These Vietnamese 
officers assumed the greatest risks, risking their lives and 
endangering their families, to join the United States in their fight 
for freedom.

When the United States pulled out of Vietnam, there were dire 
consequences for these brave men who risked everything to fight for the 
United States. The officers were rounded up. Some were imprisoned for 
15 years or more and some were executed.

Those who managed to flee and escape death made their way to the 
United States. They left everything in Vietnam, and made new lives in 
the United States. And they were able to enjoy the freedoms that they 
had fought for, but not in the country that they had hoped for.

Let me just take a moment to set the stage for this ceremony. As the 
sheriff, I sat down at a round table with many of these Vietnamese 
soldiers and police officers. They came in their uniforms that they 
brought along with them, those that were able to escape, those that 
spent 15 to 17 years in a prison camp where they were beaten, where 
they were tortured, where they lost their freedom. They lost their 
dignity, but they never gave up hope.

When they came here to the United States of America and they come 
together on this evening to celebrate their freedom, and the American 
flag is brought into that room, those men stand at attention and they 
salute. But you know what else they do? They cry. When the American 
flag is brought in, they cry because they lost their freedom. But now 
they know what it is like to have it back. It is a dramatic scene.

If we leave too soon in Iraq, what happened to these Vietnamese 
officers could certainly happen to those Iraqi soldiers who bravely 
fought side by side with our troops today. I don't use this example as 
a way of comparing this conflict with Vietnam, as some have done. I 
believe that the two wars are very different. I use it because it could 
happen again.

I never want to attend an event where former Iraqi soldiers are 
attending a similar ceremony. The fact is that we are engaged in a 
global war with people intent on killing us, killing Americans. And 
regardless of how we got into Iraq, Iraq is now the central front of 
this war.

I understand that there are many who think we should not have entered 
Iraq. We now know there was faulty intelligence that led us into Iraq 
and to make that decision. But the war is upon us nonetheless. I am 
elected to deal with what is happening now.

The consequences of declaring an end to the war in Iraq without 
victory would be felt for decades. Our enemies around the world would 
be emboldened. Iran and al Qaeda would declare victory. Our allies in 
Iraq would certainly face bloodshed and our allies around the world 
would question our resolve to help protect them.

Our troops are clear about their dedication to their mission; they 
want to succeed. American soldiers dutifully responded when we asked 
them to go to Iraq and oust a dictator, establish an infrastructure, 
and train the Iraqis so that they are able to protect themselves.

Now we must do what the troops have asked of us. They have given us 
their service, and in too many cases they have given us their lives. We 
must give them the opportunity for victory.

Our current strategy in Iraq is failing. And yet failure is not an 
option, not only for the United States' security, but also for the 
security of the Iraqi soldiers and police officers that still fight 
today, side by side with our troops.

In November the American people told us that they wanted a new 
strategy, not because they wanted to lose, but because they want to 
win. And now we have a new strategy before us. Is this new plan going 
to work? I don't know. No one in this body that will vote on this 
resolution, this nonbinding resolution, knows whether or not this plan 
will work.

But what I do know is that we first must find a way to achieve 
victory. And simply saying ''no'' to a plan without offering an 
alternative won't work, and it sends a terrible message to our enemies 
and to our soldiers. This is an historic war. America is engaged in a 
war for our freedom on a scale that we have never experienced before.

I understand the dissension, the questions, and the uncertainty. I 
understand the cost is high and the way is unclear. As a cop, I have 
lost partners, I have lost friends in the line of duty. I know the pain 
that causes. I understand the loss. It is sad. It is tragic, and you 
never forget. But we must remain focused, ladies and gentlemen. Please 
don't let those sacrifices be in vain.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on this resolution 
and let us send a message to our enemies and our troops alike, we will 
always support our young men and women who put their lives on the line 
for freedom and


that we will give them what it takes to succeed in the missions that we 
have given them.
