Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.

Let's be practical. This is about rural America. These are about 
towns that are under 20,000 people who have come together and decided 
they want to build community facilities, community centers so people 
can get together and solve problems. They have to put up the money for 
their match, and they are asking for a competitive grant program, means 
that their ideas have got to compete with other ideas in small towns 
around the Nation.

This gentleman gets up and berates the fact that he is taking all 
this time to cut this money out of rural America for something that 
they want. You go back and tell your taxpayers that, while we are 
sitting here, we spent $13,732,620 in Iraq in one hour, in one hour. 
And they are building community centers over there for the Iraqis. We 
can build community centers for our communities in the United States.

I oppose this amendment.
