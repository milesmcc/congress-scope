Ms. HIRONO. I thank the gentleman for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of House Resolution 
109. Today we will be taking action on two related measures, House 
Resolution 122, earlier debated, and this resolution.

One of the lowest points in American history occurred 65 years ago 
when the Constitution and civil rights of 120,000 persons of Japanese 
ancestry were trampled upon by their own government. Under the cloud of 
war, hysteria, false rumors and racial bigotry fueled official 
misconduct that led to the uprooting of innocent aliens and citizens 
alike in one of the worst wholesale infringements of constitutional 
rights in the 20th century.

As a consequence, thousands of persons of Japanese ancestry were 
forced by their own government to dispose of their property, 
businesses, farms and possessions for pennies on the dollar, if 
anything at all. Families were split up and sent to different 
relocation camps. Educations were disrupted, and careers abruptly 
terminated on only a few days' notice. Wholesale violations of basic 
constitutional rights were committed in the name of national security. 
Yet not a single act of sedition or espionage by any of the evacuees 
was ever proven in any court of law.

To the contrary, the historic exploits of AJA in the 100th Battalion 
and 442nd Regimental Combat Team in Europe and the MIS in the Pacific 
and Asia proved that patriotism was not skin deep. The psychological 
and emotional pain of this experience was so deep that many evacuees 
never talked about their experiences for decades.

Many who were directly affected by the order live and work among us 
still. A member of my own congressional staff, my deputy chief of 
staff, Susan Kodani, was born in the Manzanar Relocation Camp. Her 
family was then relocated to Michigan, ironically to permit her 
college-educated father to assist in the war effort.

Many more, of course, suffered personal losses and tragedies more 
traumatic and devastating. By recognizing the historic significance of 
the Pinedale Assembly Center and by observing the Day of Remembrance as 
called for in earlier House Resolution 122, we say to the Nation and 
our fellow citizens that America can never forget this horrible 
tragedy. While it directly affected one segment of our population, the 
ramifications to all Americans are profound and no less relevant today 
as we wage war in Iraq.

The constitutional rights of all Americans are in jeopardy if any 
group of citizens can be persecuted without legal justification. We 
must all stand vigilant and alert for any attempt by any group, whether 
a small power clique or the majority of Americans, to overstep the 
bounds of the law for momentary expediency or even for claims of 
national security during war. The protection of our constitutional 
rights of all of our citizens require continued vigilance from all of 
us.
