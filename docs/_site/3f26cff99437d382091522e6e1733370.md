Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, while many of us are standing up for tax 
cuts for working middle class families, there are some on the other 
side who want to continue to provide tax breaks to millionaires, 
billionaires, and even to big oil companies earning record profits. For 
the last 7 years, we've watched these record giveaways to the 
wealthiest people and corporations turn our budget surpluses into 
record deficits.

The administration's fiscal mess is so bad that President Bush has 
borrowed more money from foreign countries than all 42 of his 
predecessors combined leaving our children in debt to unfriendly 
foreign leaders. American taxpayers are paying Iraq's bill while we 
have serious needs at home.

Yesterday, in my home State, New Hampshire, gas prices hit record 
highs, and nearly 4,300 New Hampshire families may lose their homes to 
foreclosure. It's time to help middle class families caught in the 
economic squeeze.

Now, I'm committed to changing the way Washington does business by 
giving tax relief to the people who truly need it. We can't fix our 
economy with the same policies that led to the economic slide.
