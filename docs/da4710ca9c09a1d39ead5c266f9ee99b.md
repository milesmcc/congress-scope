Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of America's 
bravest, Lance Corporal Richard Penny, who sacrificed his life in 
support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

Lance Corporal Penny graduated from Greenland High in 2006 where he 
was a standout football player. His hard work earned him the title of 
all-conference defensive tackle his senior year. Besides being a great 
athlete, he had an infectious personality that was loved by all who 
knew him.



Those who knew him best say he always had a special place in his 
heart for his country, and they knew that he would make a great Marine, 
fighting for liberty and defending freedom. Joining the Marine Corps in 
2009, Lance Corporal Penny was a machine gunner assigned to the 1st 
Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, based at 
Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He deployed to Afghanistan in March. Last 
month he was honored with a promotion to lance corporal.

Lance Corporal Richard Penny made the ultimate sacrifice for his 
country. He is a true American hero. I ask my colleagues to keep his 
family and friends in their thoughts and prayers during these very 
difficult times, and I humbly offer my appreciation and gratitude to 
this Marine for his selfless service to the security and well-being of 
all Americans.
