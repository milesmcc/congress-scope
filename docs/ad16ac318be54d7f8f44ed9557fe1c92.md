Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I rise in support of this bill which ensures that hard-earned 
benefits for disabled veterans and their surviving family members keep 
pace with their living expenses. This bill, like the last, was 
introduced by Mr. Perriello of Virginia. It will benefit each disabled 
veteran or survivor from the World War I era through the conflicts in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

I yield to the hardworking, active, and committed Mr. Perriello for 
an explanation of the bill.
