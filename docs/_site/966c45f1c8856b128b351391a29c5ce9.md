Mr. DURBIN. I might say, in response to the Senator from Virginia, 
that I don't recall the exact vote, but when Senator Lieberman offered 
an amendment to this bill last week relating to Iran, the vote was 
overwhelmingly bipartisan. We agree with that. How do you contain Iran? 
How do you stop Iraq from becoming an Iranian client state?

There is so much we can do, but the region has to respond. The 
Senator from Virginia knows as well as I do that there is division 
within the Islamic religion and that the Sunni faction or element is 
the most dominant in that region and around the world.
