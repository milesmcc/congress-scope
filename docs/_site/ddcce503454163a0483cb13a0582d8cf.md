`Mr. BIDEN â€” 14 March 2007`

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, our troops don't lose wars; bad policy and 
bad leadership lose wars. We should have the courage to stand up and 
tell the administration they have had a God-awful policy. They put our 
troops in a position that, in fact, has made it virtually impossible 
for them to succeed at the outset. They deserve a policy, a plan, but 
there is no plan.

We went to war with too few troops, we went to war unnecessarily, and 
we went to war with men and women who were ill-equipped, and they are 
coming home ill-served. It is about time we have the courage to stand 
up and say to the President: Mr. President, you have not only put us in 
harm's way, you have harmed us. You have no policy, Mr. President.

I am so tired of hearing on this floor about courage. Let's have the 
courage to tell the administration to stop this ridiculous policy they 
have.

We are taking sides in a civil war. I was there in Srebrenica. I was 
in Tuzla. I was in Sarajevo. I was in Brcko in the Balkans. How did we 
solve that? We solved that with a policy of separating the parties.

This is a cycle of self-sustaining sectarian violence that 20,000, 
30,000, 50,000, 100,000 Americans will not be able to stop. This is 
ridiculous. There is no plan. I ask the President and everyone else who 
comes forward with a plan, whether it is capping or surging or whatever 
they have: Will it answer the two-word test: Then what? Then what? Then 
what? What happens after we surge these women and men?

And by the way, he said General Petraeus is one who believes. He may 
be the only one who believes this is a good idea. Virtually no one else 
thinks it is a good idea. Look, in this story about the Constitution, 
we gave the President specific authority, which is our responsibility. 
It was to take down Saddam, if need be, it was to get rid of weapons of 
mass destruction that did not exist, and it was to get compliance with 
the U.N. resolution. Every one of those have been met. Saddam is dead, 
there were no weapons, and Iraq is in compliance with the U.N.

So if one wants to be literal about it, his mission no longer has the 
force of law. Everyone I have spoken with, including from the Biden-
Gelb plan straight through to the Iraq Study Group, says: Look, use our 
troops wisely; use them wisely. What are their missions? We have the 
right and obligation constitutionally, and we should have the courage 
constitutionally, to exercise our responsibility to say: Why are our 
troops there?

Did anybody on this floor, did anybody count on the utter 
incompetence of this administration when they were getting the 
authority they were getting? Absolute incompetence. I stood on this 
floor 3 years ago saying we need another 100,000 troops before the 
sectarian violence became self-sustaining and warned, as others did, 
that once it did, all the king's horses and all the king's men could 
not hold that country together.

So what is our objective here? Our objective is to leave Iraq 
relatively stable within its own borders, not a threat to its neighbors 
and not a haven for terror.

What is the President and my friend from Arizona and others insisting 
on? What can never be: a central government that is a democracy that is 
going to be fair to the rest of its citizens. It is not possible, mark 
my words.

So as long as the President keeps us on this ridiculous path, taking 
us off a cliff, I ask my colleagues: Does anybody think they are going 
to be able to sustain keeping American forces in Iraq at 160,000 for 
another year and a half? What do you think? What do you think is going 
to happen in Tennessee, in Delaware, in Illinois? Are we going to break 
this man's and woman's Army? What are we going to do here? How many 
times do we have to ask those 175,000 marines to rotate, three, four, 
five, six, seven times?

And what is the President's political solution? I love this. Everyone 
says there is no military solution, only a political solution. Name me 
one person who has come up with a political solution--one--other than 
me and Les Gelb.

There is a political solution. It is what history teaches us. When 
there is self-sustaining sectarian violence, there is only one of four 
possibilities:

They either, one, expire, kill one another off; two, you impose a 
dictator; three, you have an empire; or, four, you have a Federal 
system.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.
