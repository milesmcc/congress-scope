Mr. ROSS. I thank Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania for joining us this 
evening and for helping write House Resolution 97, providing for 
Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability. We are not just talking 
about this. We are trying to do something about it.

In fact, some of these key provisions were included in the defense 
authorization bill, and we want to thank Chairman Skelton and members 
of Armed Services for doing that.

It does four things. It calls for transparency on how Iraq war funds 
are spent. It calls for the creation of a Truman-like commission to 
investigate the awarding of contracts. It provides a need to fund the 
Iraq war through the normal appropriations process and not through the 
so-called emergency ''let's hide the real cost of the war'' 
supplementals. And, finally, it encourages the use of American 
resources to improve Iraqi assumption of internal policing operations. 
In other words, put Iraqis on the front line and get our soldiers off 
the front line and provide our soldiers to train their soldiers so they 
can fight their own civil war.

I yield to Mr. Donnelly.
