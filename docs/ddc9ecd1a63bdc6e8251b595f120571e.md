Mr. WARNER. Interesting, but it is important we constantly reiterate 
the message there is no military solution. As you well know in all the 
hearings of the Armed Services Committee, every uniformed officer has 
told us that straightforwardly. They are carrying out their orders from 
the President, but they are reminding us, the Congress and others, 
there is no military solution. The solution has to come by 
reconciliation amongst the Iraqi people, and it is incumbent among the 
current leadership to exercise their sovereign rights to do so.

I think we have generously taken up the time of our colleague.
