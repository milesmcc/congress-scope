`Mr. NELSON of Nebraska â€” 20 November 2008`

---


Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marine 
Cpl Adrian Robles, who was killed in action in Afghanistan on October 
22, 2008.

Corporal Robles, who was a native of Scottsbluff, NE, was assigned to 
the Second Battalion, 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine 
Expeditionary Force, based at Twentynine Palms, CA. He had worked his 
whole life to become a marine. At age 16, Corporal Robles told his 
parents about his plans to enlist and, at 17, asked that they sign 
forms which would allow him to join before his 18th birthday. His 
parents told him to wait, so he finished high school and then enlisted 
immediately.

Corporal Robles had previously served in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 
2006, and was on a tour serving in Afghanistan at the time of his 
death. Corporal Robles received three good conduct medals--an unusual 
achievement for such a young marine--as well as medals for his service 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. He served as a rifleman, the backbone of the 
Marine Corps. Originally deployed to help train Afghan Army recruits, 
his unit's mission changed as the security situation deteriorated; and 
Corporal. Robles was ''in the fight'' right to the end.

Fully aware of the dangers he faced, Corporal Robles made the 
courageous choice to serve his country and help the people of Iraq and 
Afghanistan achieve peace and security. He made the ultimate sacrifice 
so that others might enjoy the freedoms he had known all his life.

Corporal Robles represents all that we have to be proud of in our 
Armed Forces. I commend his bravery and selflessness while offering my 
deepest condolences to the family members he left behind. It is small 
comfort for those who must now go on without one they loved so dearly, 
but they know that Corporal Robles gave his life for a noble goal. I 
join all Nebraskans--indeed, all Americans--in mourning the loss of 
such a fine young man.
