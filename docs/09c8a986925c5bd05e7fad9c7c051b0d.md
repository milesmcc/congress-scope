Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment 
about U.S. policy in Afghanistan. During the course of the August 
recess, and of course with my customary practice, I traveled to 
Pennsylvania's 67 counties to take the pulse of my constituents. While 
there are many problems, there was considerable concern about what our 
policy is going to be in Afghanistan. I note at this time, according to 
yesterday's New York Times, there have been 821 American servicemembers 
killed in Afghanistan, some $189 billion has been appropriated for 
Afghanistan, and by the end of this year there will be 68,000 American 
military personnel and an additional 38,000 NATO troops from other 
countries in Afghanistan.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an extensive floor 
statement be included in the text of the Congressional Record at the 
conclusion of my statement.
