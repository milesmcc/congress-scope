`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 28 March 2007`

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Very quickly, while you get the chart to give 
the Web site, Mr. Ryan, I just wanted to say in this letter that 
Senator Reid, the leader in the Senate, and also the Speaker here in 
the House wrote to the President saying that we will no longer move in 
the old direction but, rather, a bipartisan majority of the House and 
Senate believes strongly that the U.S. mission should transition to a 
counterterrorism force protection and training equipment of the Iraqi 
forces. Phasing redeployment of U.S. troops should commence.

So this is the stage that we want to move in now. It won't be a total 
withdrawal but definitely will be making sure that there are 
accountability measures there, that their troops get trained and that 
we get our men and women back home more sooner than later.
