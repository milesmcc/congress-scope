Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of 
this Resolution honoring our National Guard on the occasion of its 
374th anniversary.

The National Guard was formed on December 13, 1636 and has fought in 
every major American conflict since that time.

Today's National Guard Soldiers and Airmen are an operational reserve 
that has served our country admirably in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around 
the world.

In fact, as we honor the National Guard today, almost 3,000 Iowa 
National Guard Soldiers are deploying to Afghanistan--the largest 
deployment for our state since World War II.

They have stood up an Agricultural Development Team which is helping 
to move the Afghan economy away from poppy production and they will 
help train the Afghan National Security Forces so that the Afghan 
people can provide for their own security.

Indeed, today's National Guard is deploying in unprecedented numbers, 
and our National Guard families are coping with multiple deployments.

And they are doing so while continuing to carry out their homeland 
security mission here at home--protecting our country's airspace and 
our communities from disasters such as the flooding that hit Iowa in 
2008.

So, as we honor the men and women of the National Guard today, let us 
thank our Citizen Soldiers, Airmen, and their families for their 
service to our Nation.

And, during this holiday season, let us remember all of our sons and 
daughters who are defending our freedom overseas.
