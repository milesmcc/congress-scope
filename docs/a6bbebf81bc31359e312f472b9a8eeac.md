Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, let me say that the Iraqi Legislature is 
going on a 2-month vacation. A 2-month vacation they are taking. We 
have been there 4/1/2/ years. And the people that give us the report is 
not Jack Murtha. The people that give us the report is the Joint Staff. 
And if you read with real glasses, you see what is happening in Iraq. 
You see incidents erupt. You see people getting killed. You see that 
nine people were killed just yesterday. You see that the IEDs are 
killing more people. More people were killed in the last 4 months than 
at any other time during the war.

We are trying to help you. We are trying to change the direction. We 
are trying to win it politically. We are trying to win this war. That 
is what we are trying to do. You can't win it if you don't look at it 
objectively. The gentleman is looking at it with rosy glasses instead 
of looking at it realistically. He is not looking at it objectively.
