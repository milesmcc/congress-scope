`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 31 October 2007`

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It's the same disjointed kind of argument that the 
President, Mr. Speaker, has given us on the SCHIP bill. This is 10 
million kids, $35 billion over 5 years. We could pay for these 10 
million kids to get health care for a whole year for 40 days in Iraq. 
And the President, who has run up $3 trillion in debt, borrowed it from 
China, raised the debt limit five times, is now going to draw the line 
in the sand on fiscal responsibility on 40 days in Iraq to provide 
health care for 10 million kids. I mean, there are so many disjointed 
arguments and floating pieces that are going around here that just 
don't make a whole lot of sense to many of us.

I hope that we can try to continue to push to get more Members on the 
other side of the aisle to join with us to do some pretty basic things 
that the American people want us to do.
