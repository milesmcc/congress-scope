Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my congratulations 
to the students, teachers, and staff members of West Creek Hills 
Elementary School, located in my Congressional District, for a very 
successful school supply drive for students in Afghanistan. In 
particular, I want to recognize 4th grader Adam Shea Aukamp for 
bringing the idea to West Creek Hills' Principal, Steve Yanni, and 
helping to organize the drive.

Adam came up with the idea for the school supply drive after reading 
a story in a newspaper for children that focused on U.S. troops serving 
in Afghanistan. The story highlighted how many Afghan children do not 
have enough school supplies, such as pencils, pens, crayons, etc. Adam 
decided he wanted to collect supplies to help Afghan children. Adam's 
mother, Barbara Sheaffer, contacted the Pennsylvania National Guard and 
connected with a colonel stationed in Afghanistan. The colonel learned 
through an interpreter that backpacks were also needed. Adam added this 
to his list.

Adam wrote a letter to his fellow students asking them to support the 
project and donate supplies. He and a few friends, including Drew 
Roman, Wesley Marshall, Jacob Doll, and Nicholas Minnich, created some 
posters and placed them around the school. They also visited classrooms 
to promote the project. Adam made announcements over the school's 
intercom system, first announcing the project, and then providing 
updates on the donation progress.

The drive lasted from November 8 through November 19, 2010. In the 
end, the school collected: 12 pencil boxes, 37 backpacks, 113 notebooks 
and writing tablets, 139 crayon boxes, 343 pens, and, 1,577 pencils.

Once again, congratulations to Adam Aukamp and all members of the 
West Creek Hills Elementary School community. Their efforts are an 
inspiration to all Americans and stand as a wonderful testament to the 
unparalleled generosity of our Nation's citizens, young and old.
