Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, as we enter this period when the 
President is going to come before us and ask us to extend the surge in 
Iraq, we ought to hear the story of Jamie Dean.

Jamie Dean was a 29-year-old who came from Hollywood, Maryland. He 
enlisted and served 4 years, including 1 year in Afghanistan where he 
cleaned out caves and did all of the tough things that went on there. 
He came home severely depressed, suffering from PTSD, was being treated 
at the Veterans Hospital after being honorably discharged from the 
United States Army.

And then he got the letter. On November 26, he received a letter that 
said pursuant to Executive Order of 14 September 2001, you are relieved 
from your present reserve component status and are ordered to report to 
duty. He was going to be sent within 2 months into Iraq, a man who is 
suffering from PTSD.

This man broke. He started to drink. He had weapons holed up in his 
home. The day after Christmas, he was surrounded by the police and was 
shot dead.

We are breaking the Army. We are breaking the Marines. These people 
should be thought about when we consider the extension.
