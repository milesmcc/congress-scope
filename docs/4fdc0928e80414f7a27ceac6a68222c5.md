`Ms. CLARKE â€” 18 December 2007`

Ms. CLARKE. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for 
his leadership in this body and the management of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, the extended military deployments in Iraq and 
Afghanistan have placed a great economic burden and hardship on many of 
our military families. Countless thousands of families are forced to 
not only cope with anguish of having a family member serving in harm's 
way, but also must deal with the economic hardships. That is why I am 
proud that H.R. 3933, a bill that I introduced, has a significant place 
in the heart of the HEART Act, which makes permanent three provisions 
that bring vital tax relief to help our soldiers and their families.

This bill assures military compensation is excluded from income if it 
is earned in the combat zone or while hospitalized for wounds, 
diseases, or injuries received in combat, and permits active duty 
Reservists to make penalty free withdrawals from retirement plans and 
ends the penalties.

I want to thank Mr. Rangel for his consistent leadership on this 
issue and for including my bill, H.R. 3933, as part of the HEART Act of 
2007. I am just proud to have been able to play a part in paying down 
on the debt of gratitude we owe to our women and men that serve and 
protect us on the front lines.
