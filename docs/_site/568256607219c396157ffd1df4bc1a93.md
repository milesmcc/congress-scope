`Mr. BLUNT â€” 12 July 2007`

Mr. BLUNT. Using my time here, I would suggest that in the previous 
Congress, while we did have some votes on Iraq, we did not have votes 
that didn't have hearings; we didn't have votes that didn't seek 
information.

At 10:30 at night, I don't want to belabor this in the debate that 
we've already had today, but I do think that information on these kinds 
of issues would be helpful if we could gain that through the normal 
process.

And while we may have talked about Iraq in the normal process, 
certainly, many of the questions that this bill generated never had a 
chance to be asked. And just from my own perspective as a Member of 
Congress, I would think that there's a better way to approach this 
critically important issue than that.
