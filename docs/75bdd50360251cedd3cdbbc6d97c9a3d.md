Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, the National Intelligence Estimate makes it 
clear that the United States confronts grave challenges to our national 
security. Al Qaeda grows stronger with each passing day and remains 
intent on inflicting harm on the American people and others around the 
world.

The NIE confirms what many of us in this Chamber already know: the 
war in Iraq has stretched resources thin and continues to distract from 
the global war on terror. It is nearly 5 years since President Bush 
proclaimed ''mission accomplished.'' In that time, over 3,600 Americans 
have lost their lives and 26,000 more have been wounded. Despite the 
courageous efforts of our men and women in uniform, Iraq today is a 
distraction from our mission to destroy the al Qaeda network. How many 
more lives must be lost until the President and our colleagues realize 
that we must change course?

Mr. Speaker, around the world right now, our brave troops are 
fighting to protect this country and win this war. If we are going to 
prosecute the war to the best of our ability, it is time to face facts 
and reevaluate our strategy and begin a gradual redeployment of our 
troops.
