`Mr. HOLT â€” 5 February 2007`

---


Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of our 
former colleague and man of faith, Father Robert Drinan. I never had 
the honor to serve with Father Drinan in Congress, but the effects of 
his advocacy and leadership remain. In the years after he left Congress 
and contining through my election and service, I was encouraged and 
honored to have the friendship and counsel of Father Bob.

His life is unique in American history. He was the only Roman 
Catholic priest to be elected to Congress. He represented the best that 
we, as Members of Congress, can aspire to. Not bound to special 
interests or enticed by political gains, he truly cared about the 
people who had elected him and those around the globe who were 
persecuted or malnourished, who could be called ''the least of these.''

He was a passionate advocate for the poor and he called ending world 
hunger his ''number one passion.'' His opposition to the Vietnam war 
was the centerpiece of his 1970 campaign. Asked by a reporter for the 
Boston Globe why he decided to run for Congress, Father Drinan replied, 
''Why? Why not. Jesuit priests have always been avant-garde. Right?''

Born in Boston on November 15, 1920, Father Drinan never strayed far 
from the city and people he loved. After earning his bachelor's degree 
at Boston College in 1942, he enrolled in the Society of Jesus. He 
completed his seminary work at Weston College, earned a master's degree 
from Boston College, and a law degree from Georgetown University. In 
1953, Father Drinan was ordained and shortly thereafter completed his 
doctorate in theology from Gregorian University in Rome. As dean of the 
Boston College Law School, he transformed the institution into one of 
the premiere law schools in the country.

In 1980, when he left Congress, he returned as a teacher to 
Georgetown University Law School. It was there that he not only taught 
but wrote important works of scholarship and continued to serve as a 
moral compass to his students, government officials and all Americans. 
He was deeply interested in human rights, constitutional rights, civil 
liberties and ethics. Until the very end of his life he continued to 
celebrate Sunday evening mass with the law students he taught and 
loved.

It has been recalled recently that when asked about his decision to 
wear a clerical collar and a black suit, his standard reply was, ''It's 
the only suit I own.'' He was a sharp wit, but also a deeply moral man. 
Many current and former members have called Father Drinan ''the 
conscience of the House.'' Senator Edward Kennedy said of Father Drinan 
that, ''of all the hats he wore, none fit better than teacher, for he 
was a teacher to all of us.'' Father Drinan will be sadly missed by 
this institution and our Nation. I am glad that last year the House 
honored Father Drinan with the Distinguished Service Award for his 
decade of service in the House.

I knew Father Drinan best from his work as chairman on PeacePAC, a 
division of Council for a Livable World, and as director of the Center 
for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation. He was a man who believed deeply 
in world peace and he struggled mightily to achieve it. He and the 
Council for a Livable World encouraged me when I first considered 
running for this office, and I will always remember their support and 
true belief that peace should be a goal of all Members of Congress.

In November of 2006, the Council for a Livable World established the 
Father Robert F. Drinan National Peace and Human Rights Award to be 
given annually by the council to the individual who best exemplifies 
Father Drinan's commitment to peace. As Father Drinan said at the 
unveiling of the award, ''people will be reminded that: you cannot just 
make war.'' He was right to oppose the Vietnam war and right to oppose 
the Iraq war. We can all learn from his life's commitment to peace.

Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia recently eulogized 
that, ''Bob Drinan never faltered, was never discouraged. It remains 
for all of us to carry on the work for which he prepared us, to build 
an earth in which justice will prevail.''

Mr. Speaker, let us carry the spirit of Father Drinan in our hearts 
as we in Congress continue to work to complete the work he called us to 
do.
