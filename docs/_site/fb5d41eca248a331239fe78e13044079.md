Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the Friends of Kazakhstan 
Caucus, I would like to submit the following op-ed article, ''Hoping 
for the Better'', to the Congressional Record. This article, written by 
Kazakhstan's Secretary of State Kanat Saudabayev, expresses the 
continuing sense of solidarity between the United States and Kazakhstan 
as we enter into a new chapter of history with the inauguration of 
President Barack Obama. I look forward to working with President Obama 
as we continue to build our positive and productive relationship with 
the Kazakh people.

 Saudabayev: Hoping for the Better













 (By Kanat Saudabayev)




 The inauguration of Barack Obama as U.S. president has 


 opened a new page in the history of America and the world. 


 Great hopes




 for changes for the better are pinned on the new American 


 leader. We in Kazakhstan sincerely wish the 44th U.S. 


 president strong health and strong political will to fully 


 realize his good intentions of making America and the world 


 safer and more prosperous.



 Kazakhstan and the U.S. are time-tested strategic partners 


 with successful experience of working together in such 


 critical areas as nonproliferation of weapons of mass 


 destruction, the fight against terrorism, energy, and 


 democracy. A phone conversation soon after the election 


 between Obama and Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev 


 instilled confidence that, under the new administration, 


 Kazakhstan-U.S. relations would continue to grow. The two 


 leaders discussed further cooperation on pressing 


 international problems such as nonproliferation, the fight 


 against terrorism and the stabilization of Afghanistan.



 We in Kazakhstan not only share the new administration's 


 concern with these problems but also believe their solution 


 lies through stronger cooperation of progressive nations 


 sharing common values. Closing our ranks even further is 


 especially crucial today in the face of the most serious 


 economic crisis the world has seen. ''America is strongest 


 when we act alongside strong partners,'' says President 


 Obama. Kazakhstan is such a partner eager to continue working 


 shoulder to shoulder with the United States and others to 


 build a more secure and prosperous world.



 Cooperation in the critical area of nonproliferation has 


 been a cornerstone of our strategic partnership. In the early 


 1990s, President Nazarbayev took a courageous decision to 


 voluntarily renounce the world's fourth-largest nuclear 


 arsenal (which it held while part of the old Soviet Union). 


 Working with the U.S. under the outstanding Nunn-Lugar 


 Cooperative Threat Reduction program, Kazakhstan has fully 


 rid itself of nuclear weapons and their infrastructure, 


 becoming an active participant in global nonproliferation 


 processes. Today, our cooperation, recognized as the most 


 effective model for removing a nuclear threat, successfully 


 continues.



 We are greatly encouraged by the fact that nonproliferation 


 is among the top priorities for President Obama and his 


 administration. We believe it is necessary to not only 


 continue our bilateral cooperation, but also to use more 


 actively the example of Kazakhstan's nuclear disarmament and 


 our cooperation with the United States in convincing other 


 countries to renounce their nuclear-weapon ambitions. 


 Kazakhstan's dynamic economic development since independence, 


 and the evolution of our country into an equal and respected 


 partner of the international community--confirmed by 


 Kazakhstan's election as chair of the Organization for 


 Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the 


 Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC)--these are all 


 arguments which prove that renouncing nuclear weapons and 


 opting for mutually beneficial cooperation with the world is 


 a more effective way of ensuring a country's security than a 


 nuclear bludgeon.



 Kazakhstan, having initially supported efforts of the 


 United States and other countries in Operation Enduring 


 Freedom, will continue to assist the international coalition 


 actions in Afghanistan as these are directed at strengthening 


 security and stability in Central Asia and beyond, which is 


 in our common interests. The international community should 


 pour more efforts into the political settlement and economic 


 rehabilitation of Afghanistan, as well as in reducing, and, 


 eventually, eliminating fully, the production and smuggling 


 of drugs out of that country.



 Today, it is crucial to continue building bridges between 


 Islam and the West, and to renounce phobia of Islam in the 


 West and phobia of the West in the Islamic world. Kazakhstan, 


 a secular Muslim-majority country bridging Europe and Asia, 


 is uniquely positioned to promote such dialogue and 


 understanding. At President Nazarbayev's initiative, this 


 year Kazakhstan will host the Third Congress of Leaders of 


 World and Traditional Religions. Last year, Astana hosted a 


 forum, ''Common World: Progress through Diversity,'' bringing 


 together foreign ministers from Western and Oriental nations. 


 Last but not least, Kazakhstan will chair the OSCE in 2010 


 and the OIC in 2011. Promoting the dialog of civilizations 


 during this important period will be one of our top 


 priorities, and we hope to achieve greater mutual 


 understanding between the West and the Islamic world. Again, 


 Kazakhstan is eager to work together with the United States 


 in this area of great importance to us all.



 We welcome Barack Obama's intention to visit Kazakhstan. He 


 would become the first-ever sitting U.S. President to visit 


 not just Kazakhstan but also the region of Central Asia. Such 


 a visit would both give a new, powerful boost to our 


 bilateral cooperation and help chart a new way forward in 


 U.S. relations with moderate Muslim nations. That is why we 


 sincerely say to the American leader: ''Welcome to 


 Kazakhstan, Mr. President!''
