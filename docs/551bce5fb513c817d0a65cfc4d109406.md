Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me take the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, 
to acknowledge the crisis that many of us see occurring with the brave 
men and women that return from fighting in Iraq and fighting in 
Afghanistan.

We have just finished a very thoughtful and collaborative effort to 
address the serious questions of our military and the Department of 
Defense, and the good news is that this bill has impacted or emphasized 
more on the needs of families.

I look forward to working with this body to develop more post-
traumatic stress centers in underserved areas where military personnel 
will be returning to their homes. We already know the dastardly 
conditions that our military face in Iraq and Afghanistan, the long 
hours and tediousness of the DMZ and many other places around the 
world.

Our military personnel are suffering, and I look forward to working 
with this committee, the Veterans Affairs Committee, to ensure that 
centers like the Riverside Medical Center in Houston, Texas, can be a 
site for post-traumatic stress for our soldiers returning home so that 
their physical needs and their mental needs can be serviced. I look 
forward to this.

I believe we can do better by our soldiers as we move forward on 
helping them improve their mental health.
