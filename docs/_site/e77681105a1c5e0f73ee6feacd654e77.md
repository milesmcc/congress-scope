Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. A lot 
of people don't know it, but his family has made a personal sacrifice 
in their efforts in this war. We appreciate that very much. The Senator 
from Missouri outlined the consequences of surrender in a very 
articulate way.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any quorum calls during 
the debate on the Iraq resolutions be equally divided.
