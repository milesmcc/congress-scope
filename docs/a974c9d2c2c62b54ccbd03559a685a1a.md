`Mr. CARNEY â€” 17 December 2007`

Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman and 
appreciate the comments of our friends on the other side.

Dennis Veater is somebody we are very proud of from the 10th 
District, and I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 3911.

I would like to take a moment to talk about and honor Dennis Veater


and those from Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District. He was born 
in Quantico. He moved to Pennsylvania where he graduated from Abington 
Heights High School in 2004. At the age of 17 he enlisted in the Marine 
Corps Reserves. Dennis proudly followed in the footsteps of his father, 
a retired marine sergeant major.

Unfortunately, as we have already found out, 2 weeks before his 
scheduled return, he was mortally injured while conducting combat 
operations in the Anbar province, Iraq. He died of his wounds in 
Fallujah. Lance Corporal Veater died fighting for our freedom. He is 
truly a hero, and he represents what is best about Pennsylvania's 10th 
Congressional District.

It is my hope by naming the post office at 95 Church Street in 
Jessup, Pennsylvania, as the Lance Corporal Dennis Veater Post Office, 
future generations will remember what this brave young man did for 
them.

I urge all Members of Congress to honor this hero and vote in favor 
of this legislation.
