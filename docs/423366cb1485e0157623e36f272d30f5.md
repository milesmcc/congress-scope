Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might 
consume.

I want to thank all the Congress colleagues from Georgia, especially 
my Atlanta colleagues Mr. Johnson and Mr. Lewis, and especially the 
Senator from Georgia, Senator Isakson, for making sure this is on the 
floor today.

The poor state of a lot of the infrastructure of the Veterans Affairs 
is well-known.

Through what we call the CARES process, the Capital Asset Realignment 
for Enhanced Services, the department found that the existing inpatient 
wards at the Atlanta VA Medical Center are far below community 
standards.

This renovation project will go a long way to address the American 
with Disabilities Act accessibility requirements, the needs of women 
veterans, particularly as they relate to privacy issues, and the 
improvements in efficient functional design.

These deficiency corrections are long overdue, and we think they will 
be met


here. These infrastructure improvements to utility systems will include 
the plumbing, electrical, fire and safety concerns on the inpatient 
floors.

With the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, it is even more 
important that the VA is able to provide the best health care available 
in the most updated and modern facilities.

In fiscal year 2005, this project received $20.5 million, and S. 1396 
provides the reauthorization of this project to move forward.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I want to thank the 
ranking member, Mr. Buyer, for his cooperation. I know that he has 
great respect for the CARES process and would like to consider all of 
the facilities in one construction bill. We are pledged to do that 
early next year, but I think this is an obvious need at this moment, 
and I look forward to working with the ranking member to make sure we 
meet the needs of VA infrastructure across the whole country, and we 
intend to work together and do that early next year.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
