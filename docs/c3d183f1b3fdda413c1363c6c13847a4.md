`Mr. BLUMENAUER â€” 11 September 2007`

---


Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I join every American in 
remembering September 11 and the victims who so tragically lost their 
lives in an unspeakable act of violence. We all grieve with the 
families they left behind and are deeply grateful for the rescue 
workers and ordinary citizens that displayed extraordinary humanity and 
bravery.

We owe it to them to make our Nation and the world safer.

The new Democratic majority in Congress is bringing about effective 
change in the way our Nation confronts the threat of terror. The recent 
passage into law of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations was an 
important, though overdue, step to making our homeland more secure.

But those who lost their lives or put themselves in harm's way on 9/
11 deserve more. The administration's ill-advised war in Iraq 
undermines a significant opportunity to bring Osama bin Laden and the 
real perpetrators to justice. It is my hope that we as a Congress will 
work together to reverse this course and refocus our efforts. We still 
have much work to do to recover from this tragedy, to protect our 
liberty, and to regain our credibility and stature in the eyes of the 
world.
