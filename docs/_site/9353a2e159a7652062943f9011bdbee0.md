Mr. KINGSTON. Something curious is that the Speaker of the House said 
we need to get out of Iraq and go to Afghanistan where the real war on 
terrorism is.

It is kind of scary to think that someone who is third in line to the 
President would have that kind of a naive misunderstanding of the world 
we live in.

We have been joined by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer), and 
I want to hear what he has to say.
