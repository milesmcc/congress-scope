Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to let all of our troops 
serving overseas know that America supports you. Eliminating or cutting 
funding for our men and women who wear the uniform of the United States 
is not a recipe for ensuring stability in the Middle East; in fact, it 
is a recipe for demoralization, and it is irresponsible in its 
proposal. I urge all Members to support our troops and oppose any 
effort to cut off or restrict funding for American troops in harm's 
way, whether in Iraq, in Afghanistan, or elsewhere in the global war on 
terror.

It is imperative that we fully support those who are on the front 
lines fighting the war on terror. America thanks you, our brave men and 
women in uniform.
