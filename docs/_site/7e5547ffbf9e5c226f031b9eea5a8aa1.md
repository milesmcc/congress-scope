Mrs. KIRKPATRICK of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, yesterday folks across 
America gathered together to celebrate our national flag. For 233 years 
now, the Stars and Stripes have been a unique symbol of freedom and 
democracy across the globe, the representation of all we are and all 
that we stand for. Millions of young men and women fought and died for 
their country under that flag, and every day our servicemembers risk 
their lives in Afghanistan, Iraq and around the world to protect the 
ideals it represents.

To burn or desecrate it is an insult to those who have made the 
ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe and to those who helped build our 
great Nation. It should be illegal, and this Congress should make it 
illegal by finally passing a constitutional amendment to ban the 
burning of a U.S. flag. Every day this House begins its work by 
pledging allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. We 
need to live up to that pledge.
