Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, under the agreement, I have 5 minutes. I 
will just take 4 minutes, and if the Chair will notify me when I have 
used that time so the Senator from Arkansas can have her 2 minutes-
plus.

It is interesting here that the American economy is suffering from 
some ailment that leads us to believe it is headed to recession. So how 
are we going to treat this ailment, this fever? Well, we are trying to 
come up with some medicine in a hurry before it gets worse.

The Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates, and then we 
understood we could do our part in Congress on a bipartisan basis: 
Let's try to do something now before something worse happens. We know 
how bad it is: all of the people who are unemployed, the stock market 
in trouble, housing in shambles across America, the housing industry 
flat on its back. So we tried to come up with something quick, 
temporary, and targeted to get this economy back on its feet.

I give credit to both the House Republicans and Democrats for 
reaching agreement and sending us a bill. Then we sat down in the 
Senate and said: Can we improve it? Is there a way to put a little more 
medicine in this package so it will work?

Senator Max Baucus and Senator Chuck Grassley--Democrat and 
Republican--on a bipartisan basis came up with a really good package. 
We tried to pass that last night. We missed it by one vote. We needed 
one more Republican vote. We had all the Democrats and eight 
Republicans. We needed one more. We could not get it done. So today we 
decided we had to take the best parts of it that we could on a 
bipartisan basis and pass it. I am glad we are going to do that.

As I go around this country, people say the same thing over and over: 
Will you stop squabbling on Capitol Hill and get down to work? Will you 
try to work together? Today, we will. What the Senate Finance Committee 
did was improve the House bill and give us a chance to help this ailing 
economy get back on its feet.

What if this is not enough medicine? What if it is the wrong 
medicine? I think we are going to go back to some of the things that 
were rejected last night.

Unemployment insurance--boy, read the list. Madam President, 1.2 
million Americans are going to see their unemployment insurance 
benefits end this month. We want to extend their protection. There are 
some who came to the floor on the other side who argued against that. 
Oh, they say if somebody is unemployed, you have to punish them, you 
have to pressure them to go back to work. Ever try to live on an 
unemployment check? I have run into people who do it, and it is not a 
rosy life. I think people are looking for jobs and finding them very 
difficult to locate.

I think we are going to return, and many of the things rejected last 
night by the Republican side will be part of the second dose of 
medicine for this economy. This economy needs to get well. We need to 
give the right medicine in the right amounts for it to happen. This is 
a good start. With one more Republican vote last night, I think we 
could have given that full spectrum of medicine to put this economy on 
the right track.

If our efforts fail now with this stimulus package, we need to come 
back and put back into the law the things that were defeated last night 
by the Republicans, and more. We need an economic recovery package for 
America. I am sick and tired of sending billions of dollars to Iraq to 
rebuild hospitals and schools and highways and not do the same thing in 
America.


We have to focus on putting Americans to work with good-paying jobs, 
with decent benefits, so they will be spending again and this economy 
starts chugging forward again. For too long, we have ignored working 
families, and any economic recovery plan has to focus on those working 
families first. That is why I hope we pass this soon, monitor it 
carefully, and if we do more, let us respond as quickly as we can.

I reserve the remainder of my time for the Senator from Arkansas.
