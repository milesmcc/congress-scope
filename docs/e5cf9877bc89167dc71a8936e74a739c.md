Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.

The gentleman says give the Iraqi Government a chance. We are on our 
fifth year, Mr. Speaker. Three American soldiers lost their lives in 
Iraq yesterday, bringing the total to 3,858 deaths. I think we have 
given them more than a chance.

Mr. Speaker, at this point I would like to yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton).
