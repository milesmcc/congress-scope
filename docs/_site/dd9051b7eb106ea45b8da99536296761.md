Mr. BERMAN. I thank my friend for yielding. I have tremendous respect 
for my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. I know he always has 
the best interests of the Nation and our armed services at heart. But I 
must oppose the amendment.

As much as all of us would like to have our brave men and women home


again reunited with their loved ones, we don't have a choice but to 
keep the troops on the ground in Afghanistan for some period of time. 
The only way we can succeed in Afghanistan is to create an environment 
conducive to development and good governance. Our U.S. military is an 
essential component of that.

Requiring President Obama to develop an ''exit strategy''--only a few 
months after he increased the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and 
launched a new strategy--would raise questions about our commitment to 
the Afghan people and complicate our efforts to help them create a 
stable and secure nation in a way that would supersede whatever 
benefits we could get from the passage of this amendment.

I would ask my colleagues to give the President's plan a chance to 
work.
