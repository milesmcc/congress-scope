Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
kind remarks and for his service here. You have been a great colleague 
and a great champion for our men and women who are serving so bravely 
and so well all around the globe. It is not just Iraq, as my friend 
knows, and here shortly I will be recognizing another colleague to talk 
about this threat that we face. But first, I want to recognize my 
friend and colleague on the Armed Services Committee and a great 
American himself, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Hayes.
