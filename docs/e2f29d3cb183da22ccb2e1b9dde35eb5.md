Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, by calling for a withdrawal date from 
Iraq, today the House is making a compromise that marks another stage 
in the unfortunate struggle with the President to end the war. Yet 
despite our hard work and the desire of the American people, this bill 
faces a veto from a President who is out of touch both with what the 
American people and the Iraqi people want: winding down the presence of 
American troops who are stuck in the midst of a civil war.

This is not the precise legislation I would have written, but it is a 
fair compromise that reflects the mindset of Americans who voted for a 
new direction in Iraq. The U.S. spends $8 billion a month on the war, 
and Oregon has already lost 54 brave men and women in Iraq. I have 
opposed the war from the start, and this bill hastens the day when we 
bring the tragedy of the Iraq War to a close. I urge support for it.
