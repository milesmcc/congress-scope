`Mr. ISRAEL â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. ISRAEL. I would like to raise another very specific solution, 
bipartisan solution that the Center Aisle Caucus has with respect to 
Iraq.

Last week, and I know my colleagues may be shocked to hear this, or 
perhaps they won't be shocked, perhaps they have had the same 
experience I have, but last week I met with an Iraqi refugee and his 
family. This individual was a translator for coalition forces, risked 
his life as a translator.

The work that he was doing was saving the lives of our forces, of our 
military people. He has a wife, a son and a disabled daughter. He 
decided that Iraq was no longer a safe place for his family. Why? Not 
just because of the war, but because of the service that he performed 
for the American military. So he applied for a special immigrant visa, 
and this is what he was told:


First you have to find a general to sign the form. He said, well, I 
don't know many generals who can sign this form.

Can I find someone else? He was told, no, the regulation is that you 
have to find a general. Well, he found a general who signed, who 
vouched for his credibility.

Then he was told, well, you can't apply for a special immigrant visa 
here in Iraq. You actually have to leave Iraq, go to another country 
and apply.

Well, that's just mind-boggling. Again, this is somebody who risked 
his life translating for American forces, and they have saved their 
lives, when they have translated what the bad guys were saying and what 
they were planning, and he was told, you have to leave Iraq to submit 
your visa application. So he found his way with his family to Amman, 
Jordan.

Then he was told, by the way, when you apply for this special 
immigrant visa, you have got to pay fees, hundreds and hundreds of 
dollars. This young man didn't have that kind of money. Can you 
imagine, he was, again, interpreting for our military and then told to 
leave the country and perhaps save his life; he had to pay a fee for 
himself, his wife, his son, his disabled daughter. Guess what, he came 
up with the money. Then he sat for a year in Jordan and waited for them 
to process the application.

I want to make sure that you understand the point that I am making. 
We are not saying we should open the doors for every single refugee, 
let them in without being properly vetted, without the proper security 
checks, without the background checks; but certainly someone who is 
providing services to the United States military, who had already been 
vetted by the military, who was saving lives, deserves better than, you 
have got to leave the country, you have got to find a general to sign 
the form, you have to pay hundreds of dollars for the form, you have to 
wait for a year, and then we will see if we can let you in.

To top it off, when he finally arrived here, this individual, who has 
critical military skills, the ability to read and understand what our 
enemies may be saying about us, was told, well, you have got to find a 
job somewhere, maybe you can drive a taxi. I think the State Department 
and Department of Defense ought to be rolling out the red carpet for 
this individual.

One of the most glaring deficiencies we have in our military right 
now is an inability to translate documents, to hear what our enemies 
are saying about us. We ought to be hiring these people at whatever 
salary we can afford to pay them.

Then to add insult to injury, when he came here, he asked, well, how 
do I get various documents? There was no one area to give him some 
information, nothing.

So Frank Wolf, who was the ranking Republican of the State and 
Foreign Operations Subcommittee on which I now serve, and I have 
introduced legislation that would make this system a little easier for 
people who have already established that they can help the United 
States.

Number one, we would allow our Ambassador in Iraq to have more 
authority so that he can vouch for the credibility of those who 
assisted U.S. efforts.

Number two, we allow those people to apply for visas at the U.S. 
Embassy or U.S. Consulate in Iraq. We don't force them to go to another 
country, Jordan or elsewhere.

Number three, we waive fees for those who have demonstrated their 
support for U.S. forces, their assistance, who have been properly 
vetted. We help find translators find work in the United States in the 
military and State Department, and we broaden relocation benefits.

Now, who can be against somebody who helped our Armed Forces by 
translating for them? I can't think of a single person who would say, 
no, they risked their lives, but we have to make them stay there. We 
have to make it harder for them and suggest this is another area of 
bipartisan agreement that we can agree on.

I am hopeful that the Israel-Wolf resolution will be passed by the 
House, passed by the Senate, and signed by the President.

I don't know whether any of my colleagues would like to comment on 
that particular legislation or share some of their thoughts, but I 
would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
