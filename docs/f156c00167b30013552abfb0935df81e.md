# TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007
## `f156c00167b30013552abfb0935df81e`
`Mr. POMEROY â€” 10 October 2007`

Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, my friend is an articulate and forceful 
advocate. And we are all moved by the story of his time with the 
accountant, but they did not owe a tax. And basically, there is a 
figure missing from the motion to recommit he brings before us today, a 
very important figure: the cost of what the underlying motion to 
recommit would require. That figure is $498.8 billion. Now, we are a 
Nation of $9 trillion of debt, $9 trillion of debt, and they bring 
forward a proposal that would add another $498.8 billion, and they fail 
to say anything about how they are going to pay for it in their motion.

Well, obviously serious-minded legislators like my friend would not 
bring forward a serious proposal about repeal of the estate tax without 
some means of paying for it, and that is really what the heart of this 
motion is. It is not a real estate tax motion. This is a kill-the-
underlying-bill motion.

The other side has some different priorities. Last week they were 
against SCHIP, expanding health insurance to uninsured kids. This week 
they are basically for privatizing debt collection of IRS debt. You 
like what Blackwater is doing in Iraq; you're going to love sending IRS 
debt to private bill collectors here.




Because they aren't going to prevail on the debate itself, they want 
to keep the vote from happening at all, which is what the underlying 
motion to recommit does, sends it promptly back to the Ways and Means 
Committee, which means the underlying bill is not before the House for 
a vote.

Mr. Speaker, to further use the time in our opposition to the motion 
to recommit, it is my honor to yield to the chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee, Mr. Rangel from New York.
