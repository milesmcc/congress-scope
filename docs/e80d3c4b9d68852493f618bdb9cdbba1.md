# MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--

`Mr. KERRY â€” 22 May 2008`

---


Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are in the sixth year of the war in 
Iraq, and the costs to our troops, our security, and our country rise 
by the day. With the current course still not working, I have no choice 
but to vote against amendments 4817 and 4818 to the Military 
Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations 
Act of 2008. It is clear that these measures continue to give President 
Bush a blank check to continue his chosen policy, despite the constant 
warnings of military experts who tell us that there is no military 
solution to Iraq's civil war and that political compromise in Iraq will 
not occur absent meaningful deadlines for the transition of our mission 
and the redeployment of U.S. troops.

I believe this was an occasion where Congress had the responsibility 
to force the President to change a policy that is broken. Not to 
caution, warn, or cajole--not to give a blank check and hope for the 
best--but to force a change in a policy that is making us weaker, not 
stronger.

Make no mistake--on the core issue of changing our deployment in 
Iraq, these amendments are deficient, and that is why I must oppose 
them. However, they contain provisions many of us have supported time 
and again.

Particularly, the first amendment has many important provisions that 
I support, including mandating dwell time between deployments for our 
troops, a prohibition on permanent bases in Iraq, and the requirement 
that any long-term security agreements with Iraq be subject to approval 
by the Senate. But because the language with respect to Iraq--setting a 
nonbinding goal of completing the transition of the mission by June of 
2009--is not strong enough, I cannot support the amendment.

I also oppose the second amendment, which provides billions and 
billions more in funding for the war without


any policy corrections at all. This is tantamount to giving the 
President another blank check to continue with an Iraq war policy that 
I strongly believe is making America less safe. There is no requirement 
to transition the mission and no deadline to leverage political 
progress. And there is no relief for a military stretched to the 
breaking point. That approach will not resolve the sectarian divisions 
that have fed this civil war, it will not bring long-term stability to 
Iraq, and it will not protect our national security interests around 
the world.

All of us--and I would underscore, all of us--are incredibly grateful 
for the remarkable sacrifices our troops have made in Iraq. They have 
done whatever we have asked of them, and they have served brilliantly. 
The question before us now is whether we have a strategy that is worthy 
of their sacrifice.

We can all agree that there is no purely military solution to the 
problems in Iraq. All of our military commanders, including General 
Petraeus, as well as Secretary Gates and Secretary Rice, have told us 
as much. And when the President announced his escalation to the 
American public last January, he said the purpose was to create 
''breathing room'' for national reconciliation to move forward.

Over a year later, it is clear that this escalation did not 
accomplish its primary goal of fostering sustainable political 
progress. General Petraeus himself recently said that ''no one'' in the 
U.S. or Iraqi Governments ''feels that there has been sufficient 
progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation.''

I don't believe that it is too much to ask of Iraqis to make tough 
compromises when over 4,000 of our troops have given their lives to 
provide them that opportunity. In fact, I think the only strategy that 
honors the tremendous sacrifice of our troops is one that pushes the 
Iraqis to solve their own problems. And by General Petraeus's own 
account, the current strategy is not accomplishing that.

By my count, we are now entering the fifth war in Iraq. The first was 
against Saddam Hussein and his supposed weapons of mass destruction. 
Then came the insurgency that Dick Cheney told us nearly 2 years ago 
was in its last throes. There was the fight against al-Qaida terrorists 
whom, the administration said, it was better to fight over there than 
here. There was a Sunni-Shia civil war that exploded after the Samara 
mosque bombing. As we saw in Basra, there may be a nascent intra-Shia 
civil war in southern Iraq. And nobody should be surprised if we see a 
sixth war between Iraqi Kurds and Arabs over Kirkuk.

We are also on at least our fifth ''strategy'' for Iraq. First there 
was ''Shock and Awe,'' which was supposed to begin a peaceful 
transition to democracy in Iraq. Then there were ''search and destroy'' 
missions designed to fight the growing insurgency. There was the era of 
''As they stand up, we'll stand down,'' focused on transitioning 
responsibility to Iraqi security forces. That was followed by the 
''National Strategy for Victory'' and the introduction of the ''Clear, 
Hold and Build'' approach. And last year, we had the ''New Way 
Forward,'' with the troop escalation that was supposed to provide 
breathing room for the Iraqis to make political progress.

What we have never had is a strategy that brought about genuine 
political reconciliation or that made Iraqis stand up for Iraq or that 
allowed us to meet our strategic objectives and bring our troops home. 
What we have never seen is an exit strategy.

In fact, at the beginning of the war in 2003, we had about 150,000 
U.S. troops in Iraq. Today, there are still about 150,000 U.S. troops 
on the ground. After more than 5 years, after more than 4,000 U.S. 
lives lost, after more than $500 billion dollars spent, we are 
basically right back where we started from--with no end in sight.

And we know that after the escalation ends in July the plan is to 
keep some 140,000 troops in Iraq--slightly more than the levels of 
early 2007, when the violence was out of control and political 
reconciliation was non-existent.

So it looks like the sixth strategy is basically to repeat what 
didn't work the first time and hope for a different result. And we keep 
hearing that approach justified with the twisted logic that because we 
cannot afford to fail in Iraq, we must continue with a strategy that 
has failed to achieve our primary goals.

We clearly need a new approach that fundamentally changes the 
dynamic, and I continue to believe that Iraqis will not make the tough 
political compromises necessary to stabilize the country while they can 
depend on the security blanket provided by the indefinite presence of 
large numbers of U.S. troops.

One thing we know is that the costs of continuing down this path are 
extraordinary. Over $12 billion per month and over 900 soldiers dead 
since the surge began. And while we are bogged down in Iraq, we 
continue to neglect the most pressing threats to our nation's security.

Let's be clear: The war in Iraq is not making us safer--it is making 
us less safe. Iran has been empowered in the region and emboldened to 
defy the international community in pursuit of its nuclear program. 
Hezbollah and Hamas are stronger than ever. Our military is stretched 
to the breaking point. Our intelligence agencies have told us Iraq is a 
''cause celebre'' for al-Qaida that helps ''to energize the broader 
Sunni extremist community, raise resources and to recruit and 
indoctrinate operatives, including for homeland attacks.'' So it is no 
surprise that terrorist incidents outside Iraq and Afghanistan have 
risen dramatically since the war began and are now at historic highs.

And we know where the real threats lie: Our top national security 
officials keep warning us that the next attack is likely to come from 
the Afghanistan-Pakistan border--not Iraq. Meanwhile Afghanistan slides 
backwards, in part because--as Admiral Mullen has acknowledged--with so 
many troops tied down in Iraq, we simply don't have the manpower 
available to give our military commanders the troops they need.

Every day we fail to change course we play further into the hands of 
our enemies. We need a fundamentally new approach to our Nation's 
security in the region and around the world--and that starts with a new 
strategy that in Iraq. The events of the last year have shown once 
again a basic truth: Iraqis will not resolve their differences and 
stand up for Iraq while they can depend on the security blanket 
provided by the indefinite presence of large numbers of U.S. troops.

As we redeploy, we need to engage diplomatically with Iraq's 
neighbors in a way that creates a new security structure for the 
region. And we must responsibly redeploy from Iraq so we can refocus 
our efforts on fighting al-Qaida around the world--especially on the 
real front line in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
