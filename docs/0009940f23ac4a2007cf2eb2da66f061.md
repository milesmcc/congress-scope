Mr. INOUYE. We have seen a rise in roadside bomb attacks in 
Afghanistan this year, and it was very clear that, as we went through 
the request, we had to accelerate this critical force protection 
program. The administration's request in the fiscal year 2009 
supplemental includes $1.5 billion for approximately 1000 vehicles. The 
fiscal year 2010 overseas contingency operations budget request 
included roughly $1.5 billion for about the same number of vehicles. 
The Defense Subcommittee added $1.55 billion for the MRAP ATV to 
accelerate the procurement of these critical vehicles.
