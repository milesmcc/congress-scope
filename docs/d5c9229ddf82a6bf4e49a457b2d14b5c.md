Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the patience of all Senators. I 
am going to, in a couple minutes, move to table the Graham first-degree 
amendment. That vote will take place shortly. Following that, I have 
asked Senators Kennedy and Enzi to sit down and see if there is a way 
we can finish this important legislation. We have other things to do 
this week. We have the farm bill that will be here within the hour from 
the House. We have the budget conferees we have to appoint. Senator 
Dorgan is pushing hard on the media cross-ownership. That is something 
we need to complete this week. I want all Senators to see what they can 
do to exert influence on their friends to finish this bill. I have 
talked to the head of the firefighters. He is tremendously troubled 
that we ran into this roadblock. The underlying bill is very important. 
I would hope everyone understands that. We have all next week to do 
whatever needs to be done on the supplemental appropriations bill. We 
will get into a lot of discussion on the war in Iraq and what is going 
to happen to returning veterans.

In the meantime, it is my understanding the matter before the Senate 
is the Graham first-degree amendment. I move to table Graham amendment 
No. 4763 and ask for the yeas and nays.
