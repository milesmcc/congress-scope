`Mr. NELSON of Florida â€” 30 April 2007`

Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I commend my colleague from 
Illinois for the very cogent and heartfelt plea he has made that this 
Government function as it should between the three branches and that 
the appropriations process is one which is joined between the executive 
branch and the legislative branch. It was never intended to be all one 
way or not. Yet that is what publicly has been insisted by the White 
House on this Iraq funding bill. It is expected that the President is 
going to veto this legislation. Then the question is, Are we going to 
be able to have a meeting of the minds? Can we have a little bit less 
partisanship and a lot more, as the Good Book says, come let us reason 
together? It is my hope that we will see more of that.
