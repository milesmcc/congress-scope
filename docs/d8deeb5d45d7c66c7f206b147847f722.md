Mr. KUCINICH. This Thursday, I will bring to the House a resolution 
which will finally give this House a chance to debate the war in 
Afghanistan.

We now have about 1,000 U.S. troops who have perished in the 
conflict. We have many innocent civilians who have lost their lives. We 
have a corrupt central government in Afghanistan that is basically 
stealing U.S. tax dollars.

The Washington Post had a story last week of how up to $200 million 
is passing through airports from Kabul to Dubai, and it is suspected 
the money is either U.S. aid, money from drug traffic, or both. What a 
mess this is.

We are finally going to have a vote on the privileged resolution. It 
will be dropped on Thursday; it will lay over for the weekend. On 
Tuesday there will be a rule. On Wednesday we will have 3 hours of 
debate.

Let's get ready to debate Afghanistan, and let's get ready for 
Congress to get in the game and take Americans out.
