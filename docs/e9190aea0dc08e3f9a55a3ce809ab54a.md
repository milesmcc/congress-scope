Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, on this fifth anniversary of the war in 
Iraq being commemorated in the Capitol today, the statistics tell the 
tale.

Because of the military surge and Sunni cooperation, we are making 
significant progress towards stability and freedom in Iraq. Violence is 
down nationwide by more than 60 percent in the last year.

But as the saying goes, seeing is believing, and thanks to the 
miracle of youtube.com, Americans can join me for a walk down the 
streets of Haditha, Iraq, in the heart of al Anbar province. On March 
2, with a military security detail and our bipartisan delegation, we 
walked the streets of this war-torn city, and I posted 15 minutes of 
unedited interviews with local Iraqis on youtube.com.

The fight is far from over, but we are making significant progress in 
Iraq. Thanks to youtube.com, the American people can hear and see that 
progress for themselves.
