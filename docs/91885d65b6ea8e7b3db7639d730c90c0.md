Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Democrats in the House voted four times to end this 
war in Iraq, yet the President and most of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle refuse to acknowledge the realities on the ground and 
continue to ignore the pleas of the American people.

Sadly, the President is dealing with an Iraq that exists only in his 
imagination. It is time for the President to understand that this House 
will not endorse a blank check for an endless war. Our resolve remains 
unwavering because we know the American people have our back.

Under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, we are united in our efforts 
to bring an end to this war. Congressman McGovern's bill moves us 
closer to achieving that goal.

The phones in my office are ringing off the hook with constituents, 
as I am sure they are across the Capitol, asking me to vote, begging me 
to vote for this bill to put an end to the war in Iraq.

Listen to the mothers of America on this Mother's Day weekend. They 
are saying, support our children in uniform by bringing them home.

This bill does that. I urge strong support for it.
