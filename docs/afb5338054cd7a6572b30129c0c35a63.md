Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it seems to me we have to face the reality 
of fact. Now, this would be an independent report. Obviously, I think 
the Department of Defense would come back and provide some rebuttal or 
some additional information, so we would have to take all the 
viewpoints and put them together. But what I say to my distinguished 
colleague from Illinois is we are still relying solely upon these 
reports that come on an annual basis. I read through them, and I 
encourage others to do so. It is very difficult to glean from these 
reports that sound, basic fact: Are they trained? Are they equipped? 
Are they ready? Most importantly, I say to the Senator, do they have 
the commitment in their hearts to take orders and fight on behalf of 
the Iraqi people? That is what concerns me because of the large amount 
of AWOL, absentees, and all the other types of things that are 
reflected in this report.
