# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `8687446b5f5893a3adbc17362dce6028`
`Mr. ROONEY â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. ROONEY. First, I want to acknowledge and thank Congressman John 
Boccieri and Congressman Duncan Hunter for their service in 
Afghanistan.

Madam Speaker, as a former captain in the Army in the 1st Cavalry 
Division and as an instructor at West Point, I had the distinct honor 
of teaching some of the men and women who are now serving in 
Afghanistan. I heard from them directly about the progress being made 
and about the need for the continued support of this Congress. It is 
for that reason that I will vote ''no'' on this resolution.

Withdrawal now would destabilize that area of the world, and it would 
create a vacuum for terror. Groups like al Qaeda and the Taliban would 
increasingly gain access to weapons that would cause great damage to 
our allies and, eventually, to us.

General McChrystal's implementation of President Obama's 
counterinsurgency strategy is producing dramatic successes, including 
the capture of key Taliban leaders and the rooting out of Taliban 
forces.

A withdrawal now undermines what our troops have done. It undermines 
the winning strategy we are pursuing in Afghanistan, a strategy we all 
know the United States can achieve. It is for that reason I encourage 
my colleagues to send a message to our troops and to vote ''no.''
