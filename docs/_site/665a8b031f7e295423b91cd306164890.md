# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `665a8b031f7e295423b91cd306164890`
`Mr. HOLT â€” 16 February 2007`

Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution.

Madam Speaker, this week during the debate on H. Con. Res. 63, I 
spoke of the men and women of our Armed Forces and the sacrifices they 
have made for our country. I noted that I had visited them in theater, 
at Walter Reed, and with their families in New Jersey. As I said, the 
quality of these men and women, and their earnest wish to serve their 
country, makes this situation in Iraq all the more tragic. I am sure I 
was quite clear regarding my sentiments, but it would appear that some 
in this House chose to mischaracterize my remarks.

The gentleman from California, Mr. Hunter, said that I ''referred to 
our wounded folks in Walter Reed as tragic.'' I want the gentleman to 
know I said no such thing, and I will ask him to be accurate if he 
chooses to quote me again.
