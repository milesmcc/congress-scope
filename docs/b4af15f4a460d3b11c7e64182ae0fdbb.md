Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to submit a 
resolution with Senator Inouye recognizing one of the most important, 
but often overlooked, nations in the world: Indonesia.

Just this past week, Secretary of State Clinton, our former 
colleague, journeyed to a meeting of the Southeast Asia nations in 
Thailand and pledged greater and increased American involvement in 
support of the region. I applaud her. She is definitely on the right 
track.

Many Americans are not aware of the fact, but Indonesia is the third 
largest democracy in the world after India and the United States.

Early this month, I came to the Senate floor to recognize and 
celebrate yet another democratic milestone in Indonesia: the reelection 
of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, known for obvious reasons as 
SBY. His victory will quicken the pace of democratic reform that has 
been keeping Indonesia moving in the right direction.

SBY's first tenure as President was a success. His choice to select 
Boediono as his running mate has raised expectations of accelerated 
reform for a second term in office. The duo has campaigned on a ticket 
of clean governance and reforms to promote broad-based economic growth.

In addition to the democratic politics, Indonesia's religious 
leanings also trend very positive. By and large, Indonesians reject 
violent brands of Islam. The Nation was founded on the principles of 
what is known as Pancasilla, or respect for religious and cultural 
diversity and the desire to create a pluralistic society, and as a 
country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesians 
are also proud to showcase that Islam and democracy are compatible and 
can work together.

But despite the moderate, peaceful-loving population of Indonesia, 
groups such as Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf are still seeking to 
spread Islamist terror and their extremist ideologies across Indonesia 
and Southeast Asia, often resulting in violence and death. The world 
was shocked and saddened over the most recent terrorist violence just 
this past week. Early on the morning of July 17, suicide bombers 
attacked two hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia, killing innocent people and 
injuring scores more.

The latest terrorist attack should be a wake-up call. The twin 
suicide attacks in Jakarta last Friday underscore the perils of our 
Nation continuing to ignore this nation and this region. The dangers of 
continuing down our current path are very real. By overlooking this 
region, Southeast Asia could become a breeding ground of terrorist 
activity for generations and for future Americans to deal with. If left 
ignored, Southeast Asia and Indonesia will be the next front in the war 
on terror.

It doesn't have to be this way. It is critical that the United States 
act now, before violent extremists gain traction in their quest to 
spread their fundamentalist ideologies enforced by violent terrorist 
acts across Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia.

This effort requires first that the United States do more than give 
lipservice to Southeast Asian countries about our strong partnership. 
Yes, counterterrorism cooperation is very important, but for many 
nations in Southeast Asia, they see this partnership as, once again, 
the United States only asking for self-serving help, coming when we see 
a danger to our country but not coming to find out what their needs and 
what their desires are. If we want nations in Southeast Asia to be 
strong partners in the war on terror, we must also be willing to extend 
a hand of friendship in other ways, assuring that they are strong, 
stable democracies with economic strength and good jobs and progress 
for their people.

The first thing we must do is increase trade among our nations. 
Southeast Asia, including nations such as Indonesia, Thailand, 
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and many smaller countries, 
represents our fifth largest trading partner. While this will help 
create economic opportunities in our own Nation to export to them, it 
will also help many poverty-stricken people in Southeast Asia as we buy 
from them, as we invest there, as we create businesses that will 
generate small and medium enterprises to fill the needs of those 
businesses and create locally owned and controlled entrepreneurships 
that can benefit their country in many ways.

People who are hungry, without a job, or maybe even a roof over their 
head, are particularly vulnerable to ideologies that promise a better 
way of life, whether or not those ideologies deliver. The United States 
must realize that before a person can choose his politics, he has to 
have enough to eat and a stable, secure community in which to live.

That is the simple truth behind Smart Power--a term I use to describe 
the combination of military might where necessary with diplomatic 
efforts, educational exchanges, economic development, and more personal 
interaction. We need this in Southeast Asia. I believe Smart Power is 
an effective way to fight radical ideologies that use terrorist attacks 
against their own government and freedom-loving people elsewhere.

This was recognized by General Petraeus and by President Bush when 
the President authorized him to institute the counterinsurgency 
strategy in Iraq, which means not only do we go in and clear an area of 
al-Qaida, but we stay there to make sure al-Qaida doesn't come back, 
and we then work with those provinces, with those areas, with the local 
governments and the local leaders, to build the infrastructure they 
need to help them get the health care to do things that are important 
to build a strong community.

In Al-Anbar, for example, a Sunni region that had been a major 
concern for the United States, one of the first things the Marines did 
in 2007 was rebuild the Sunnis' Blue Mosque, one of the most important 
mosques in the region.

This is the kind of effort we need to make in those areas where we 
are not actively fighting. We have the military might to support those 
countries in their battle against terrorist activities when they pick 
up, to fight against piracy that might occur off their shores.

As vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a member of 
the Defense and State Foreign Operations Committee, I am working with 
my colleagues to ensure that Congress provides the resources and policy 
initiatives needed to expand the use of Smart Power.

For instance, we must increase the number of Peace Corps volunteers 
and Foreign Service officers. We must encourage more young Americans to 
volunteer to serve in that region, more businesspeople to visit there 
and seek opportunities where they can help those countries and help us 
at the same time. It sounds simple, but I believe by putting more 
American sandals and sneakers on the ground, we can avoid sending in 
American combat troops later.

I saw firsthand the payoff of Smart Power when several Southeast 
Asian nations--particularly Indonesia--were devastated by the tsunami 
in December of 2004. The month after that disaster, I traveled to 
Southeast Asia with representatives of the U.S. Government, Deputy 
Secretary of Defense, our Ambassador. We visited the tsunami-ravaged 
areas and met with representatives from the relief organizations. We 
saw the tremendous benefits that the volunteer NGOs--nongovernment 
organizations--and the American military brought by bringing fresh 
water, bringing medical supplies, bringing food to the region, and 
helping to clear areas. Our military and volunteers from our embassy 
and elsewhere in the region helped avert what I think would have been 
tens of thousands more deaths.

We met with the Indonesian Government officials, and they were 
absolutely deeply grateful for our help in providing clean drinking 
water and


food, emergency evacuations, medical help, and rebuilding. This kind of 
assistance the United States provided in that short time created an 
unmatched outpouring of goodwill for America and an appreciation from 
other countries who helped, such as Singapore and Australia.

Unfortunately, after the flood waters receded, so, too, did America's 
Smart Power engagement in the region. The recent attacks of terrorist 
organizations--probably Jemaah Islamiyah in Jakarta--should be a wake-
up call that it is past time to reinvest in the region and quit 
ignoring the dangers of failing to do so.

President Obama, in condemning the terrorists' actions, highlighted 
this danger when he said:




 These attacks make it clear that extremists remain 


 committed to murdering innocent men, women and children of 


 any faith in all countries.


The President got it absolutely right. The war against terror is far 
from over, and the battles are not confined to the Middle East. 
Freedom-loving nations must continue to fight terrorists not just in 
the border regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also in the jungles 
and countless islands of Southeast Asia.

More than just a call to arms, however, these attacks should serve as 
a deadly reminder that the war against extremism and insurgency cannot 
be won by military might alone. Many top military and intelligence 
leaders say military action is no more than 20 percent--or maybe even 
10 percent--of the effort we should expand to ensure stability in 
governments that are friendly.

In order to be truly successful, the United States must focus the 
weight of the effort on the ideological front, reaching would-be 
terrorists before they turn violent. Today I have a resolution that 
recognizes the importance of Indonesia, but it is just a small and 
symbolic step. We must do more.

I hope my colleagues will think about this region and about the 
points I have made. America must wise up and make Smart Power 
initiatives a cornerstone of our foreign policy and our efforts to 
combat terrorism, extremism, deadly murder, and attacks around the 
world, in our country, and elsewhere. The best place to start is in 
Southeast Asia.
