Mr. MINNICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave men and 
women of our Nation's armed forces. As a U.S. Army veteran, I 
understand how important it is that we keep our promises and thank them 
for their commitment to freedom.

I'm pleased to announce the introduction of the Rural Veterans 
Reimbursement Act. This bill enjoys bipartisan support and has been 
endorsed by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and the 
American Legion.

This legislation will allow rural veterans to receive reimbursement 
for their food and lodging any time they must travel to a VA medical 
facility to seek treatment for a service-connected injury. Many 
veterans living in backcountry Idaho and in other rural areas around 
the country must travel on narrow, winding roads for the better part of 
a day to reach the nearest Veterans Hospital or clinic. They deserve to 
be reimbursed for their travel expenses.
