Mr. BIDEN. If we don't start bringing home combat forces within the 
next few months, get them out of the midst of a civil war, we will have 
so soured the American people on the ability to do even the things that 
need be done that this President and the next President will be left 
with absolutely no option--absolutely no option--but to withdraw 
totally from that area and let the chips fall where they may.

You know, that is exactly what we started to propose, the Senator 
from California and others, Senator Levin, in the Biden-Hagel-Snowe-
Levin resolution opposing the surge back in January and of the Biden-
Levin provision in the Iraqi supplemental bill, the very thing the 
President vetoed. The common denominator in all these efforts has been 
to transition our troops to a more limited mission so we can start to 
bring them home and set the groundwork for being able to leave behind a 
political solution.

That is exactly what Senator Levin is doing today. He is taking the 
Biden-Levin amendment, now called the Levin-Reed amendment, and he is 
going back at it. I compliment him for it because we have to keep 
pushing in order to change the minds of our Republican friends by 
keeping pressure on them to start to vote for the troops and not the 
President.
