Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee for 
yielding.

No matter how the Members vote on the two amendments before the House 
on this measure, I know that every one of us is absolutely committed to 
our men and women in harm's way and prays for their safe return home.

I also know that the Members on our side of the aisle, regardless of 
how we vote on these amendments, are united in our collective judgment 
that the President's policy is failing; and that after 4 years of 
repeated misjudgments in Iraq by this administration, it is long past 
time to insist that the administration and the Iraqi Government be held 
accountable for making progress; and, that we must change direction in 
Iraq.

In fact, the American public strongly support the Democratic position 
on the war. Just today, the latest New York Times/CBS poll found that 
76 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, say that 
the troop surge has either had no impact or made the situation worse. 
Meanwhile, 63 percent said the United States should set a date for 
withdrawing troops sometime in 2008. That, of course, is what the bill 
that we passed and sent to the President did. He vetoed it. That 
position was adopted by the majority of this House and the majority of 
the Senate in the last supplemental bill.

And 69 percent say Congress should appropriate money for the war on 
the condition that we set benchmarks for progress. I am pleased, of 
course, that the Warner language is in there, but it is not enough.

Mr. Speaker, it is deeply disappointing that the President continues 
to defy the will of the American people. But today, with this amendment 
which includes 18 strong new benchmarks on political, security, and 
economic progress, and other reporting requirements, I believe this 
Congress has moved the ball forward and begun to hold the 
administration accountable.

Is it as far as we are going to go? It is not. Should we go further? 
We must. Make no mistake, this amendment does not provide everything 
that we had hoped for, but I do not believe that it provides a blank 
check or that this Congress is rubber-stamping the President's request. 
The President did not want the Warner amendment attached. He doesn't 
want any constraints.

In addition to benchmarks, this requires the President to report on 
progress in July and September, and ties all economic support for Iraq 
to progress on the benchmarks, although a waiver is required. Why? 
Because the President said he would veto the bill if it was not.

The fact is, this is simply the best bill we could put together and 
that would be signed. It is a political reality. It is not what we want 
to pass.

It imposes truly for the first time ever a level of accountability 
that did not exist, however, previously. For the first time ever, we 
are also calling for the Iraqi Security Forces to step up and do the 
job assigned to them so our soldiers can step down by providing funding 
for an outside review of the Iraq Security Forces' current capacity and 
their reliance on our Armed Forces.

We have moved the ball forward. Far enough? No. Do we need to move 
further? Yes. But we have advanced toward a new direction and a new 
policy


in Iraq. And in the months ahead, we will continue to fight for a new 
direction in Iraq in the fiscal year 2008 defense appropriations bill 
and other measures to be considered.

Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say that I am very pleased that the 
second amendment being considered will provide for the first time in a 
decade a long overdue increase in the Federal minimum wage, as well as 
additional funding for defense and veterans health care, and homeland 
security, drought relief, the State Children's Health Insurance 
Program, and gulf coast recovery. The Katrina provision is a critical 
one.

Mr. Speaker, I will vote for both of these amendments, and I urge my 
colleagues to do so as well.
