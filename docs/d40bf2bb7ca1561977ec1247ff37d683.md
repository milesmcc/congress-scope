`Mr. FORBES â€” 3 October 2007`

Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, once again I scratch my head as I listen. 
The gentleman has just stated on the one hand that the legislation does 
not reduce the jurisdiction and then 30 seconds later he says, oh, but 
there are differences between the bases in Germany and the bases in 
Iraq and it's okay if we don't prosecute the ones in Germany. We can't 
have it both ways.

Madam Chairman, this significantly does do it. The bottom line on 
this is that we have created a new standard which is proximity to 
contingency operations before we could reach in and get those bad 
actors in Germany and


many of the bad actors that were in the contingency operation areas.

I want to emphasize again on the FBI, it's not that we mind the FBI 
doing the work. We want to make sure that they are secure when they do 
it, and give them the funds to do it because they are stretched so thin 
defending us here against terrorists and defending us against gang and 
other criminal activities here, that it makes no sense for us to 
mandate that they would take those resources and spend them overseas 
without giving them the funds to do it.

Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
