`Mr. MORAN of Virginia â€” 25 September 2007`

---


Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, how many more thousands of lives 
and hundreds of billions of dollars need to be spent to enable this 
President to avoid accountability, to save face for the worst foreign 
policy fiasco in America's history?

And when all is said and done, when all the blood and the treasure 
has been spent and we look back at what we will have accomplished, we 
will have a Shia theocracy far more loyal to Iran than it is to the 
United States, and probably equally repressive of women's rights and 
human rights. How is that possibly worthy of the sacrifice of our 
soldiers? Mr. Speaker, it is not.

The fact is that, if the President's supplemental for Iraq that he is 
requesting now is granted, we will be spending almost as much in 1 
week, $3.5 billion, as it would take to provide needed health insurance 
for 4 million poor children for an entire year. Isn't it time to put 
America's priorities in order?
