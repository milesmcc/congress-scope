Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, it is my hope that we can come 
together and agree on an Iraq emergency supplemental that provides the 
resources our troops need without tying the hands of our generals and 
forcing them to adhere to unrealistic timetables.

Last week in a Chicago Tribune editorial, they stated: ''President 
Bush will veto the war spending bill approved by Congress this week 
because it contains a timetable for withdrawing U.S. combat troops from 
Iraq. He is right to do so.''

With a new commanding general on the ground and the surge strategy 
still ramping up, our troops deserve this chance to make progress, and 
we are starting to see signs in Iraq that things are modestly 
improving.

I urge my colleagues to support a clean supplemental and to encourage 
patience as we heard 4 years ago before we even went to Iraq that this 
would be a long time coming, that our ultimate goal in accomplishing 
victory in Iraq would take some time. We need to listen to those 
comments, and, again, I urge patience.
