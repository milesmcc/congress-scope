Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this body 
have a moment of silence in memory of 11 great soldiers at Fort Hood, 
TX, who have been shot down this afternoon at the base at a processing 
center where they were being prepared to be deployed to Iraq and 
Afghanistan. In addition, the person who was the main shooter has also 
been killed. Over 30 of our great personnel are also injured and being 
treated as we speak.

When I spoke to the general a few minutes ago, the base, Fort Hood, 
was still in lockdown to make sure they have checked every possibility 
that there would be no more shootings. I know all of us love our 
military and appreciate everything they do. For them to have to suffer 
even more tragedy like this, as they are on their way to protect our 
freedom, is unthinkable.

I ask unanimous consent that all of us show how deeply we care about 
them right now on the floor of the Senate.
