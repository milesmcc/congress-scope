Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, during the break, the director of police in 
Memphis, Tennessee, Director Larry Godwin, called me. He called me to 
thank me for the COPS bill. He called me to thank me because he was 
going to hire 125 policemen in the next fiscal year and 125 in the 
following fiscal year and those would be hired because of COPS monies 
that were in the Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Director Godwin and I have known each other for a long time because I 
started my career as the attorney for the Memphis Police Department, 
attended International Association of Chiefs of Police meetings, and 
know that the patrol is a deterrent to crime. Patrol is the first way 
to stop crime.

These COPS programs hire more policemen, put them on the street, and 
oftentimes in innovative community policing activities.

The Afro American Police Association, Lieutenant Curry, and others 
have talked to me about community policing and how it helps my 
community reduce crime.

My Mayor, Willie Harrington, has asked me to come to Washington and 
work to get more COPS money and help him with putting more cops on the 
street; and that was one of the first things I wanted to do here. I'm a 
cosponsor of this bill. I am a proud supporter of it, and voted for the 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act because crime is a serious issue all over 
this country.

We support policemen in Afghanistan and Iraq. We need to support 
policemen all over this country and protect our citizens from crime.

The crime rate is going up. And by supporting this COPS bill you can 
make a difference. You can keep citizens alive and reduce crime. This 
is an effective deterrent to crime. It's what the policemen on the 
street tell me. It's why the Office of the United States Mayors has 
endorsed this bill.

I rely on the United States Mayors, the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police, my cops on the street, and my experience as a police 
legal advisor.

And I appreciate Mr. Weiner for bringing this bill, and I'm proud to 
be a sponsor, and urge this House to pass it.
