Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week the National 
Intelligence Estimate report stated that al Qaeda is the most serious 
threat to the U.S. homeland.

On Tuesday President Bush flew to my home State of South Carolina to 
speak to troops in Charleston. In his speech he reminded the Nation of 
the threat that al Qaeda poses to our Nation and the stability of Iraq. 
The threat is real.

I would like to share with you a Fourth of July blog entry from 
Lieutenant Colonel Clarence Bowser, who is currently serving with the 
South Carolina National Guard in Kandahar, Afghanistan:

''I am so proud of my service here and to this Nation. I don't know 
the politics; I'll leave that to the politicians. But it is my prayer 
for their leadership and that we as a Nation do the right thing for 
this country and Iraq.''

Mr. Speaker, my hope and my prayer is that we as politicians have the 
courage to do the same: win this fight.
