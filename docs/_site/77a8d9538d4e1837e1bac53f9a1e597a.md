`Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas â€” 1 July 2010`

Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I rise strongly to support the Barbara Lee 
amendment, of which I am a cosponsor. And this is allowing the orderly 
withdrawal of our troops, one thing that we did not do in the Vietnam 
war, when we lost 58,000 of our young men and women, who we treasure 
and thank them for their service.

Now today we have the opportunity to do what Congress should do. It's 
not to give an unending mandate to a war that is not a constitutionally 
declared war, which this is not.

So I would say that if we are looking for the terrorists, al Qaeda is 
not there. Our intelligence authorities, and General Petraeus have 
indicated that there are less than a hundred al Qaeda terrorists in 
Afghanistan. There are insurgents who are the Taliban. It is well known 
that if you give to the Taliban the mountains and valleys that have 
been given by General McChrystal, and concentrate your war efforts in 
the cities, you still will lose this war. The Taliban will never 
surrender the mountains and will continue to attack.

A thousand-plus have died; $37 billion is in this bill. We must do 
what we did not do in Vietnam, and not cry after the fact when we saw 
the 58,000 body bags come home.

Yes, we salute the young men and women who are on the front lines. We 
thank them for their service and the sacrifice of their families. I 
have been to Afghanistan many times, and I believe we have a better 
way. Now is the time to invest in the Afghan people, and the government 
to make a difference, not continue to lose the precious treasure of 
America. Stand against this war and have an orderly withdrawal for the 
sake of the American people and bring our troops home with honor. 
America has not lost the war. America has created a roadmap for 
Afghanistan to follow and to build its country up.

Our stated, limited military mission was precisely to hold back 
Talibon momentum--i.e., to ''stalemate'' it--while economics 
development and good governance took hold and we enabled Afghan 
security forces to replace ours. Instead, our military assistance has 
dwarfed our development and government efforts--which are still 
stumbling--and no independent analyst seriously thinks the Afghan army 
and police will be able to take over the nation's security for years. 
Military's momentum has taken over.

We have changed the Afghan equation, but for the worse. The U.S. 
troop surge illustrates a lesson we learned in Vietnam. Large-scale 
insertion of foreign troops into a domestic insurgency--whatever its 
initial cause--dramatically transforms the hostilities from an internal 
dispute into one focused on driving out ''foreign invaders,'' as 
Afghanistan has done repeatedly throughout its history.

Even if, contrary to fact, a Taliban takeover threatened our 
security, the Administration's strategy would make no sense. There is a 
basic contradiction between, on the one hand, the claim that defeating 
the Taliban is vital to our safety and, on the other hand, the claim 
that our commitment is short term and of limited extent. The two 
efforts to square that inconsistency have already proven unrealistic.

The Pentagon told us that successful campaigns in Taliban strongholds 
like Helmand and Kandahar Provinces would break the back of Taliban 
efforts to control the country and bring them to the bargaining table.

The Pentagon told us that successful campaigns in Taliban strongholds 
like Helmand and Kandahar Provinces would break the back of Taliban 
efforts to control the country and bring them to the bargaining table.

But it now is very unlikely that our military will be holding a 
decisive upper hand after the Kandahar and similar campaigns. The 
Helmand campaign remains, at best, a ''work in progress,'' with dubious 
results thus far. The supposedly decision campaign to ''win Kandahar 
province'' has been heavily diluted and downgraded, even before getting 
fully underway. The new focus on nighttime raids and air strikes 
continues to kill civilians, badly undercutting U.S. strategy to ''win 
over'' the Afghan people.

June was the deadliest month of the nine-year-long Afghanistan war. 
Should the U.S. get out of Afghanistan? Why or why not?

Frank Askin, professor of law at Rutgers University, said: There is 
no use throwing good money (and good bodies) after bad. There can be no 
successful outcome to this war, unless we are prepared to stay in 
Afghanistan forever. We need the money back home, Let's just declare 
victory and get out!

Paul Kawika Martin, policy and political director of Peace Action, 
said: Yes, the U.S. should get the military out of Afghanistan.

Today, Representatives in the house will have the opportunity to vote 
against $33 Billion dollars ''emergency'' supplemental funding for the 
failed escalation in Afghanistan. They will also have the opportunity 
to vote for a MdGovern/Obey amendment that will among other things 
require the president to present Congress with:

(1) a new National Intelligence Estimate on Afghanistan by January 
31, 2011. 2) a plan by April 4, 2011 on the safe, orderly and 
expeditious redeployment of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, including a 
timeframe for the completion of the redeployment.

The amendment also requires Congress to vote if the president wants 
to change his announce plan to begin to drawdown troops by July 2011 
and expands oversight of private contractors in Afghanistan to deal 
more effectively with corruption, waste, fraud and abuse.

A large coalition of 20 organization representing nearly 13 million 
people support this amendment because the enormous costs in blood and 
treasure is not necessarily making Americans safer. Instead, focusing 
on regional political solutions and investing in Afghan-led aid and 
development that brings people out of poverty has a far better chance 
of success at a fraction of the cost. Let's not forget that we are 
funding this war by borrowing from China and as Admiral Mike Mullen, 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said last week: debt is the number 
one threat to America's National Security. It is time to bring our 
troops home with honor.
