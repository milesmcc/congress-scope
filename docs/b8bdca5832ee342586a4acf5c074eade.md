Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, what is it that my friends on the other 
side don't understand about the threat that faces our country today? 
Have they not seen the reports coming from Iraq where al Qaeda in Iraq 
has now stated that their objective is to use Iraq to launch attacks 
against Jerusalem and Israel? Have they not read the reports today 
about a radical Islamist plot to perhaps assassinate the President of 
the Philippines? Have they not read about the attacks or the arrests in 
Denmark of radical Islamists perhaps planning an attack in Denmark?

What is it that you don't understand about the nature of the threat, 
that this is a global threat that wants to defeat us in Iraq, that 
wants to destabilize modern Islamic regimes, wants to eliminate the 
State of Israel, establish the caliphate and reach for the brass ring, 
which is to attack the United States? Why are you unwilling to put the 
Senate FISA bill on the floor and give the intelligence community the 
tools that they need to keep America safe?
