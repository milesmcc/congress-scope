Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. If the gentleman will yield, we forget and 
time slips by that following that disastrous day, not some people were 
killed, but millions died. Again, we have forgotten the boats, the 
ships, with hundreds and thousands of Vietnamese scrambling to stay on 
board, leaky boats, rafts, as they tried to escape the horror that 
followed that day. A movie was made called ''The Killing Fields'' that 
depicted quite graphically the humanitarian disaster that followed that 
withdrawal.

I think that that scenario of a humanitarian disaster has been 
painted for us by a number of true experts in the field, even those who 
have been harshly critical of the administration's conduct of this war. 
The recognition that you could have that kind of bloodbath is widely 
seen, except perhaps by the House leadership, who has, as we said 
earlier, a plan for defeat in Iraq, which I am afraid would in fact 
lead to that kind of disaster.
