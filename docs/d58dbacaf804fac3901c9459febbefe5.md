Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Lieutenant Todd Jason Bryant was a proud and loyal American who 
served his country in fighting the war on terror. He made the ultimate 
sacrifice, defending freedom and liberty, when he lost his life on 
October 31, 2003, in Iraq.

Todd Jason Bryant was born in Long Beach, California, on January 14, 
1980. As a young student, he was very athletic and always involved in 
school activities. During high school, he played football and golf, and 
also played the tuba in the marching band. He was the youngest of three 
and was determined to follow in his siblings' path by enlisting in the 
military.

At 17, he joined the Army Reserves and completed boot camp before 
graduating from high school. He received his nomination to West Point 
Academy from the sponsor of this bill, Congressman Ken Calvert. He 
graduated from West Point in 2003 with a degree in political science. 
He had said before his death that he dreamed of being either a Member 
of Congress or a high school football coach.

His military training took him to installations in Kentucky and 
Kansas. Only 9 days before Lieutenant Bryant was sent to support 
Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, he happily wed Jenifer Reardon in 
Pittston, Pennsylvania.

On Friday, October 31, 2003, at the age of 23, Lieutenant Bryant was 
killed when a rocket-propelled grenade struck his Humvee while on 
patrol in Fallujah. Lieutenant Todd Bryant was an ambitious man who was 
able to accomplish much in his short but meaningful lifetime. Among his 
military awards are the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Meritorious Service 
Medal, National Defense Service Medal and the Army Service Ribbon.

Lieutenant Bryant will always be remembered as a fun-loving, 
humorous, cheerful, proud and loyal friend, husband, son and brother. 
He brought joy to all those around him, easily making friends through 
his contagious laughter.

Lieutenant Bryant was honored to serve his country, and he served it 
well. Let us honor his ultimate sacrifice by renaming this post office 
for him.
