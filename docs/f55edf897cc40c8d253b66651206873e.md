Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, over the last 6 years, more than 1.6 
million American troops have been deployed to either Iraq or 
Afghanistan to implement the Bush administration's military strategy. 
These troops and their families have really sacrificed, and now the 
majority of these families believe that the war in Iraq was not worth 
fighting.

The President won't listen to the generals. Perhaps he will listen to 
the military families. According to a new poll from the LA Times, 
nearly six out of 10 military families disapprove of the way the 
President is running the war in Iraq; 58 percent of military families, 
in general, think we should withdraw within a year, and 69 percent of 
those who have been in Iraq, their families would like to begin 
withdrawal within the year.

These findings come just days after the Pentagon announced a 
temporary tour of duty extension for all active


duty soldiers that will keep them deployed for 15 months rather than 
12.

Madam Speaker, our troops and their families deserve much better than 
this. Let's ask the President to listen to the generals and listen to 
the military families.
