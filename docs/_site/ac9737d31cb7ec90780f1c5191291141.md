`Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania â€” 4 September 2007`

---


Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Arkansas. It is an honor for me to be here tonight.

I would like to say to the gentleman from Arkansas, that is exactly 
right. One of the things I plan on talking about tonight are really two 
things, the small business tax cuts that we established in this 
Congress this past May, and also the Iraq Accountability Act, because I 
think it is telling.

There are a couple of housekeeping things if I may mention, Mr. 
Speaker. I know the gentleman from Tennessee was just speaking about an 
Eisenhower moment and talked about reaching out to those Americans from 
both sides of the aisle and letting them know about this common sense 
leadership we are trying to propose. What he mentioned was we need to 
listen and look at some common sense solutions. I think that is what 
people appreciate about the Blue Dogs. We are willing to reach across 
the aisle when need be to move our country in a new direction.

I know there are a lot of folks back home I know, some of which are 
my wife right now. My wife Jenny is at home. I left this morning. I 
spoke at the Rotary Club and I was at a school for the first day of 
classes starting back today back in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Then I 
had a meeting, and then I rushed down here in Washington.

It is an honor for me to be here tonight. It is tough as far as 
leaving your wife, and we are blessed with a 9 month old daughter 
Maggie Murphy, who we had her swimming out there yesterday. She was 
adorable.

I know this is a different form of public service. I know the 
gentleman from Arkansas mentioned that I served in the military. I am 
very proud of my military service. I am very proud that I wore that 
U.S. Army uniform for the first time back in 1993, and now that we are 
here in 2007, I am proud to be a Member of Congress. This is a 
different form of public service, but one just as important. I know the 
sacrifices that we have to give up, leaving our families to come down 
here to Washington and then to go back home on the weekends. It is a 
tough schedule, but one that we promised to do to the best of our 
abilities.

I know my colleague over here from New York, Mr. Arcuri, Mike Arcuri 
just got married the other day. I want to congratulate him on his 
marriage. I think he believes in what we all believe in, that we love 
our troops so much, I think he spent his honeymoon going over to see 
those troops in Iraq, leaving his new wife, Sabrina, to go over to 
those troops.

We had a conversation on this floor tonight when we were voting 
talking about his trip over there, how he went and let those troops 
know, especially the ones that are from New York, from his district, 
that he cares about them, that he took the time out of his schedule to 
be there with them, to break bread with them and let them know that he 
is fighting for them here in Washington.

I believe those troops understand what the stakes are right now. They 
understand that this United States House of Representatives, this body 
supports the troops 100 percent. We may disagree with our colleagues on 
the foreign policy and the foreign aspects of it, but never question 
the commitment and the honor that our troops are serving with. I 
believe that is why we all take time out of our schedules to let them 
know we care for them, to make sure that we draft the most effective 
policy to support them and do everything possible to make sure their 
families back at home know we are supporting them 100 percent.

Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk first, because after I left that Rotary 
Club this morning and then I was at that opening day of school at the 
Abrams Hebrew School in Yardley, Pennsylvania. I went down the road to 
two small businesses that are in Yardley, Pennsylvania. My district, as 
you know are, is all of Bucks County, northeast Philadelphia and a 
small slice of Montgomery County.

But when you look at Bucks County, there are 60,000 small businesses 
in Bucks County. Ninety-nine percent of our businesses are small 
business. And


what we passed in this House, I am very proud about, is $1.3 billion in 
tax cuts for those small businesses. We did it not just writing a blank 
check and passing that debt that we talk about to our kids, we did it 
in a fiscally responsible way, the way that Blue Dogs believe, a pay-
as-you-go system.


Everyone is real quick to write tax breaks and tax cuts, but never 
figure out to how to pay for it. Just increase our debt. Increase our 
debt. When the President signs $1.7 billion in tax cuts, it sounds 
great. Everyone wants a tax break. I want a tax break. But how are you 
going to pay for it, Mr. President? Not on the backs of our kids. Not 
on the backs of the next generation. We need the pay-as-you-go.

So when my daughter was born 9 months ago, when Maggie Murphy was 
born, she was born in Lower Bucks Hospital, she was born in this 
country owing $29,000 to our national debt. We owe $9 trillion in this 
country. A lot of that debt we owe to foreign countries, China, Korea, 
Japan. We borrowed $367 billion from Mexico.

So that means per month, per month we average about $21 billion just 
to pay the interest on this debt. It is like a credit card. You have to 
pay interest on your credit card before you even get into paying the 
principal off. Per month we have to pay $21 billion in interest.

To make a comparison, budgets are choices. Budgets are moral 
documents. Per month in the Federal Government we spend $21 billion 
just on the interest, but we only pay $5 billion on the Federal level 
on education. And to keep America more competitive, we need to invest 
in education. So that is why it is important that we partner with small 
businesses. That is what we do with the $1.3 billion in tax cuts.

How it worked out, I had two business owners, one was a CEO, his name 
is Neil Matheson today, and when he started a business, he was the only 
employee. You fast forward it, now it is a 250 person business. They 
have 140 of those employees in my district, and I am proud that many of 
them live and work in Bucks County. I talked to him. And another 
president of a small business was Kevin Kruse.

I talked to Neil Matheson and I talked to Kevin Kruse, and I talked 
to them about the challenges they faced before I was running for 
Congress and then I talked to them when I became a Member of Congress. 
We passed this, and they talked about how important this bill was that 
we passed.

Per year, they commented, Kevin Kruse specifically commented, big 
corporations which employ Americans, big corporations can sell if they 
needed some money infusion, they can sell stocks or go public. Small 
businesses don't have that option. So they have to worry about their 
cash intake and their cash flow.

So what Mr. Kruse said today when I was with him, he said this tax 
cut that the Democratic Congress passed, that the Blue Dogs championed, 
saves my business $13,000 more in deductions per year now because we 
established it through the IRS Tax Code through a pay-as-you-go system. 
That is serious money. That is serious money. That is why they stood 
with me today when we talked about it.

Before I joined the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, I talked 
about more accountability and greater oversight in Iraq and over the 
Iraqi war operations. I am a proud Member of the Blue Dog Coalition. I 
have been calling for accountability in Iraq on the floor of this great 
body for 8 months now. In fact, some of my Blue Dog colleagues have 
been demanding common sense oversight on the floor of this House for 
more than 4 years before I even got here.

Well, Mr. Speaker, the problem with these repeated calls for action 
is they seem to be falling on deaf ears down the road at 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House.

Mr. Speaker, the American public and our families at home are 
demanding some answers. Earlier this year we introduced House 
Resolution 97, to set up a Truman-type commission to track fraud, waste 
and abuse in Iraq. This was after the reports from the Special 
Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction came to the House Armed 
Services Committee, came to the committee that I have the honor to 
serve on, and he said there is $9 billion missing and 14,000 weapons 
that are missing in Iraq. But recently, the Government Accountability 
Office, again, nonpartisan, came and reported that now the number of 
weapons that are missing in Iraq went from 14,000 to 190,000. Think 
about that; 190,000 weapons, and 110,000 of those weapons were AK-47 
rifles.

Now, when I was in the military when I joined, I used to sing a 
cadence when you are running in the morning, we call it PT, physical 
training. The cadence said, ''Used to date a beauty queen; now I date 
my M-16.''

See, you held that M-16 rifle to you as if it was your girlfriend or 
your loved one, because you can never miss it. When you are in the 
field at night and you fell asleep and you had a few hours to catch 
some shuteye, you tied it around your leg so no one would steal it from 
you.

That is called accountability. That is what the Blue Dogs stand for. 
That is why I joined this organization when I came to Congress. I was 
honored to be selected and to be part of them.

You think about 110,000 weapons just missing in Iraq. Just missing. 
Imagine those weapons in the hands of Muqtada al-Sadr's militia.

The accountability is not happening in Iraq. It is not our troops' 
fault, it is the Iraqi people's fault, because they are not stepping up 
to the plate. You know, you lose a weapon in the U.S. military, you are 
probably going to be court-martialed. In Iraq, you are probably given a 
new one. That is a major difference and one that we can't stand for.

These rifles are like the ones I used to carry when I was in Baghdad, 
Iraq. When I was there four summers ago, Mr. Speaker, August was called 
fire month. The month of August in Iraq is called fire month because it 
gets so hot. Imagine our troops over in Iraq right now, in 130 degree 
weather, with all that equipment on, every day working their tails off 
to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, 
that oath that they took when they became members of our great 
military.

You look back at January when the President made the decision to 
escalate our troops over there. I spoke out against it. I thought it 
was the wrong policy. But the President overrode our decisions in 
Congress and he said, just give us 6 to 9 months for a political 
solution.

You look now, and I said then I am against the policy but I hope this 
surge works. I hope the escalation of troops works. I want our troops 
in Iraq to succeed. I spent months of my life there, and I care for the 
Iraqi people and I love our troops.

But now it has been 9 months. Now you look at what is really 
happening. They said 6 to 9 months to allow a political solution to 
happen. Nine months later, you had the Iraqi Parliament take a summer 
vacation. Take a summer vacation, when our troops are fighting every 
single day.

You had the Shia government that is in power now, before the Sunnis 
were in power, now it is the Shia, it is a democracy, they have to 
reach across the table and work with the Sunnis. They have got to put 
their personal beliefs aside for one Iraq.

So the Shia leadership, President Maliki said, okay, we are going to 
reach these benchmarks. We are going to do these commonsense things 
that we pledged to do now for years. They still haven't done them. 
Things like sharing oil revenue with the Sunnis, they haven't done 
them.

So what political solution do we have right now, Mr. Speaker? We have 
the Sunnis saying I quit. I quit. You don't see our troops quit. You 
see our troops standing up every single day.

For those listeners at home, you make sure when you see a troop, 
whether it is in a restaurant or airport or train station, you don't 
have to give them a long speech. You might not agree with the foreign 
policy of the United States of America. But I ask my fellow Americans, 
Mr. Speaker, to make sure that you tell those troops when you see them 
out there in every day America, say thank you very much for serving our 
country. That is all you need to say. It means the world to them.

I took my wife out, I had a date night the other night. I took my 
wife out, we went to Red Lobster. My wife's grandmother watched our 
little daughter. We went to date night, and, Mr. Speaker, after dinner 
she went to the restroom to use it at the Red Lobster.



I am waiting in the car, and waiting to get into the Red Lobster was 
a member of the Pennsylvania National Guard. He was there with his 
family. I took the keys out of the car. I ran up to him real quick. I 
was dressed not like a Congressman, I was just like a regular guy, just 
a regular shirt and I had shorts on him. I said to him, I said, hey, 
troop, I just want you to know that I appreciate your service to our 
country.



Then we started talking a little bit and at the end I told him I was 
a congressman and gave him my card. I said, If there is anything I can 
ever do, you let me know, and I will keep you in my prayers.

He got choked up and said, Thank you, Mr. Congressman, I appreciate 
that.

I told him, Just call me ''Patrick.'' You don't have to call me ''Mr. 
Congressman.''

We have meetings in Washington on the Armed Services Committee. I am 
also honored to serve on the Intelligence Committee. We also have 
meetings of the Blue Dog Democrats. We talk about these things at the 
Blue Dog Democrat meetings. We care with every fiber of our being for 
these troops.

Mr. Speaker, I was at a meeting with the Blue Dogs at 5:00, or 1700 
as they say in military time. I passed around a sheet talking about how 
can we take care of our troops.

When troops get orders to deploy, sometimes they don't have a lot of 
time. Sometimes they have rent. Well, they don't need to have an 
apartment if they are in Iraq or Afghanistan for 15 months, so they 
want to break their lease. There is Federal law, there is the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, so they can break their lease. It is a 
commonsense bill that this Congress passed. There is a bill that says 
expand that now to allow our troops who have cell phones, a 1-year or 
2-year program, why not allow the troops to break their cell phone 
contracts. Their cell phones are from Verizon or Cingular, and they 
don't have cell phones over in Baghdad or in Afghanistan. That 
commonsense approach says let them break their cell phone lease under 
Federal law. That is the type of backing that they need.

To get back to the Iraq Accountability Act, Mr. Speaker, you look at 
what this Iraq Accountability Act has done to shed light on fraud, 
waste and abuse. The report that I just mentioned about the 190,000 
weapons is a disgrace when you talk about accountability.

Last month, there were a total of 73 criminal investigations related 
to contract fraud in Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan; 73 criminal 
investigations. That is 73 investigations on contracts totaling $5 
billion. That is billion with a ''b,'' Mr. Speaker. The charges so far 
identify more than $15 million in bribes. If there is ever a time for a 
new direction in Iraq, now is the time, Mr. Speaker. If there is ever a 
time for accountability and oversight, now is the time, Mr. Speaker.

And as long as my fellow Blue Dogs and I are here in the House's 
great body, we will keep calling, we will keep fighting for what 
American families and what American troops deserve, and that is 
civilian leadership that is just as smart and savvy as those troops on 
the ground.

I want to thank again the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Ross, for 
allowing me to speak. I appreciate your leadership role with the Blue 
Dog Democrats.

When I was home, Mr. Speaker, and I was talking to those families in 
Bucks County, many told me, Mr. Congressman, I like that are you a Blue 
Dog and that you are standing up for fiscal responsibility and you 
stand up for change. I like the fact that you stand up for a new 
direction. I like the fact that you talk about that $9 trillion in debt 
that we have right now and how it is immoral to pass it on to our kids, 
because it is. I like the fact that the Blue Dogs stand up and say you 
have a pay-as-you-go system, not a pass-the-buck system. That is what 
happened before. That's leadership.

And, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Arkansas, to my colleague 
from the great State of New York, it is a great honor to be among your 
midst as a fellow Blue Dog.
