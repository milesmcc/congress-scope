# EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `458794639b4f629d2063b2ac8b06f758`
`Mr. NELSON of Florida â€” 5 February 2007`

---


Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in November, General Abizaid 
told our Senate Committee on Armed Services, when asked did he need any 
more troops in Iraq, he said ''no.'' Admiral Fallon, who has been 
chosen by the administration to succeed General Abizaid, when asked did 
he think by the Senate taking a position in opposition to the 
President's determination to put 21,000 new troops in Iraq that was 
undercutting the military forces in Iraq, Admiral Fallon deferred and 
would not answer that, as some others had been quick to answer in the 
affirmative.

When General Casey was in front of our committee last week, when 
asked how many additional troops do you think should be put into 
Baghdad, he said two brigades--not the five brigades the President has 
determined.

What we have is a majority of Members in this Senate feel there 
should not be any increase. We have General Casey, the commander for 
the last 2/1/2/ years, saying there should only be a two-brigade 
increase. So there is, in fact, conflicting opinion.

If we are going to have any increase in troops in Iraq, the Marine 
generals in Anbar Province have convinced this Senator that an increase 
in Anbar Province would be helpful, but the conclusion of this Senator 
was that putting more American troops in the middle of Baghdad, in the 
middle of that sectarian violence, was not going to do any good; it was 
going to put more Americans in harm's way, particularly in the limited 
numbers the President is talking about.

If we wish to make a difference in Baghdad in the midst of all that 
sectarian violence, where it has been going on for 1,327 years, since 
the year 688 A.D., after the death of Mohammed, when the grandson was 
assassinated because he broke off and that became the Shiite branch and 
the Sunnis and the Shiites have been at it ever since, if you want to 
make a difference in Baghdad with all that sectarian strife, put in 50, 
100, 200 or 300,000 troops. But 21,000--17,000 of which are going into 
Baghdad additionally--in this Senator's opinion, is not going to do the 
job.

As the Senator from Virginia knows, this Senator is one of his 
cosponsors. I support his resolution. I think it is very important 
there be truth and openness. In this Senator's position on


the Foreign Relations Committee, on the Senate Committee on Armed 
Services, and on the Intelligence Committee of the Senate, I have been 
hammering away at correct information over and over because what we 
have been dished out over the last several years has been incorrect 
information.

That leads us to this point where we have to make a judgment. We are 
a coequal branch. We are part of the formulation of policy, and it is 
intended that way by the U.S. Constitution that the people speak 
through us as well as through the President.

It is my privilege to say I support the Senator from Virginia in his 
resolution.
