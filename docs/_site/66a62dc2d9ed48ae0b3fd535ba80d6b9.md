`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 14 July 2009`

---


Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, General Sullivan is a retired former 
Chief of the U.S. Army, a great American soldier. I quote, briefly, 
from his letter to me about this amendment supporting the amendment:




 As you know, the troop increases in Afghanistan will 


 precede decreases in Iraq, causing the number of deployed 


 soldiers to increase into next year. The Chairman of the 


 Joint Chiefs of Staff testified to Congress that it will be 


 difficult to increase dwell time at home over the next 18 to 


 24 months within our current end strength. Factor in the more 


 than 30,000 soldiers who are on the rolls but not deployable, 


 and it's obvious what a strain that would be to our current 


 troop levels. . . . I hope your floor amendment [and the 


 debate of it] will help your fellow Senators see [that].



 The Army is in dire need of sufficient troops to increase 


 dwell time for active duty soldiers, increase support for 


 operational missions, and help the Army achieve 


 reorganization objectives.


He concludes:




 We say that we want to ease the stress and strain on 


 soldiers and their families, and now is the time to do the 


 one thing that will provide immediate relief.


And that is to increase the authorization of the U.S. Army end 
strength as the number of troops it can have actively deployed by 
30,000 and to fill that 30,000 increase.

Second, Admiral Ryan, another distinguished servant of the United 
States, a patriot, says:




 On behalf . . . of the Military Officers Association of 


 America . . . Today's combat forces and their families are 


 paying a terrible price.


This is a very personal letter. I will start again.




 Today's combat forces and their families are paying a 


 terrible price in family separation and stress for our past 


 failure to grow our armed forces at a pace sufficient to 


 accommodate the extraordinary wartime deployment requirements 


 of the past seven years.



 For years, we have relied on the patriotism, dedication, 


 and resilience of our men and women in uniform to bear 100 


 percent of the Nation's wartime sacrifice. But with thousands 


 experiencing their third or fourth combat tour since 2001 and 


 the prospect of a decade of persistent conflict ahead, 


 reasonable leaders must take responsible action to ease the 


 extreme strain our military members and families have been 


 required to absorb for so long.


And then he says:




 [This] amendment recognizes that the only way to do so in 


 the face of increasing deployment requirements in the near 


 term is to authorize a substantial increase in Army end 


 strength for FY2010.


That is exactly what this amendment would do. The authority provided 
in the amendment is temporary in nature and will expire in 2012. We 
hope and pray that by that time, we will be able to return the Army end 
strength to 547,000. If Congress increases the end strength of the Army 
now, as this


amendment would authorize, we would be able to reevaluate that judgment 
as conditions on the ground and in the world justify.

I say, in conclusion, again, there is no money attached to this 
amendment. This gives authority to the Defense Department to raise the 
Army end strength, the number of troops on Active Duty by 30,000. If 
Secretary Gates decides, in his judgment, it is necessary to do in our 
national interest, then he will either have to come back and ask us for 
the money to do so or he will reprogram funds that are now under his 
control.

I ask my colleagues for their support when this amendment comes up, 
and I hope it comes up soon.

I yield the floor.
