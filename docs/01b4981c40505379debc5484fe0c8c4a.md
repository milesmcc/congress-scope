Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage of a 
brave and dedicated hero of the State of Texas and of our Nation.

Corporal Ryan A. Bishop was a United States Army soldier and a true 
American hero who gallantly and selflessly gave his life for


 his country on April 14, 2007 during combat operations in Baghdad, 
Iraq.

Assigned to the tenth mountain division, Ryan enlisted during time of 
war, which speaks volumes about his character and patriotism.

Moreover, he was a leader and mentor to younger soldiers and his 
posthumous promotion to Corporal exemplifies this spirit.

Corporal Bishop is survived by his wife, Melanie and his father, 
Charles Bishop both of Tyler, Texas.

Our thoughts and prayers are with them and all of Ryan's family and 
friends.

Our community and Nation honor Corporal Bishop's memory and we are 
grateful for his faithful and distinguished service to America.

Corporal Bishop will not be forgotten. His memory lives on through 
his family and the legacy of selfless service that he so bravely 
imprinted on our hearts.
