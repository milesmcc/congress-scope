Mr. NYE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the man behind so many 
pivotal diplomatic achievements that have improved the lives of so many 
around the world and made our Nation safer: Ambassador Richard 
Holbrooke.

As a former Foreign Service Officer I first met Ambassador Holbrooke 
while I was serving at the U.S. Embassy in Macedonia, and most recently 
during a congressional delegation I led to Afghanistan. I will remember 
him as a key figure in the middle of many delicate, quintessential 
diplomatic negotiations.

Few Americans have left as big a mark on U.S. foreign policy as 
Ambassador Holbrooke. From his historic role brokering peace in the 
Balkans, to his final mission in the Afghanistan and Pakistan region, 
Ambassador Holbrooke had a fearless love for his country. He shied away 
from nothing, always diving head-first into the challenging issues of 
his time.

With the passing of Ambassador Holbrooke our country, and indeed the 
world, has lost a brilliant and respected diplomat. But his legacy will 
live on in the improved relationships we now have with countries in the 
world's toughest regions.

My heart and prayers are with his wife Kati, his sons David and 
Anthony, his stepchildren Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, and his 
daughter-in-law Sarah.
