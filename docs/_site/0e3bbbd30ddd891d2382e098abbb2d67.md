Mr. CARPER. Let me just close it down for our side. I say to Senator 
Brown, it was a great opportunity to travel with him and get to know 
him and to learn. I thank him so much for being a great part of our 
team. I also thank Wendy Anderson, who helped put that together, and 
Army MAJ Jen McDonough.

We have been joined on the floor by Congressman Robert Wittman from 
the First District of Virginia. I say, with him sitting there, how 
impressed we were with him and how delighted we were to serve with him.

The road ahead in Afghanistan won't be easy. It is an important road 
for us to travel. It is not one we have to travel by ourselves. A lot 
of other nations are involved in this with their time, their treasure, 
and their people.

We need the best efforts from the leadership of Afghanistan. We know 
he is under a lot of pressure. We made it very clear to President 
Karzai that we have no intention of being an occupying force. We have 
every intention of bringing our folks home within a reasonable period 
of time. This is not an open-ended commitment. My hope is it will not 
run up the cash register as much as Senator Ensign has suggested, but 
nevertheless it is an important use of our resources. This is the 
battle, in my judgment, this is the war we should have been fighting 
all along.

I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I yield.
