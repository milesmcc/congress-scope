Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday House Republicans offered a 
motion to recommit condemning MoveOn.org for its advertisement stating 
that General Petraeus had ''betrayed us.''

I'm wondering if they'll show similar outrage over statements made 
yesterday by conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. 
Yesterday, Limbaugh called servicemembers who support a withdrawal from 
Iraq ''phony soldiers.''

Is Limbaugh serious? Is a soldier who is honorably serving our Nation 
in Iraq any less a soldier if he questions what appears to be a never-
ending war?

Last month, seven soldiers from the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division 
wrote an op-ed in the New York Times questioning our continued war 
efforts, but also stating: ''We need not talk about our morale. As 
committed soldiers we will see this mission through.''

Now, since publication of that op-ed, two of the soldiers have died. 
As this op-ed shows, soldiers may question the war, but that does not 
mean that they're any less committed to their mission.

And now I wonder if Republicans who showed so much outrage towards 
MoveOn yesterday will hold Rush Limbaugh to the same standard. And I 
wouldn't hold your breath.
