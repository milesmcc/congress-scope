Mr. THUNE. Reclaiming my time, if I could answer the question of the 
Senator from Virginia, I talk to military personnel all the time. I 
have heard, as I have heard you express, a poll that the military 
doesn't like what we are doing in Iraq. That has certainly not been my 
experience in any conversation I have had with any member of the 
military. I would question any poll result that would conclude what you 
have stated, as I have heard you state, with regard to the views of our 
military about our work in Iraq.
