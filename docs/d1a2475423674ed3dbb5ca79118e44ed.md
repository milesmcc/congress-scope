Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, as a founding and active member of the 
Out of Iraq Caucus, someone who identifies closely with the peace 
movement and a ''no'' vote on the war itself, I rise in support of this 
measure because for the first time we have a date certain for the war 
to end, a date when U.S. combat troops must be out of Iraq.

It is not the bill I would have written, but it moves us closer to 
the goal, as clearly stated by Speaker Pelosi, of ending the war in 
Iraq.

Like many progressives, I have consistently voted against funding for 
this war. We have withstood Republican critics who say we are hurting 
the troops, because we know the way to care for them is to get them out 
of the meat grinder that is Iraq.

This vote draws a clear line between those who want to stay 
indefinitely in an unwinnable war and those of us who, along with the 
majority of Americans, want to end it. After 4 horrifying years of war, 
finally the issue before us now is when, not if, we will leave Iraq.

We aren't going to end the war with any one vote, but this vote 
should be the beginning of the end of this tragic chapter in our 
history. It will have my support.
