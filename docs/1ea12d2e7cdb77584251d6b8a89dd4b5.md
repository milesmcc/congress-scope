Mr. CARTER. Let me say as a comment that I have huge respect for 
General Cone and the outstanding job he did with the situation that 
happened at Fort Hood. And this is the same man who was preparing to 
deploy three corps to Afghanistan to start the very serious business of 
pulling American soldiers out of that combat zone. With that on his 
plate, this fellow in his lap, I think he did an outstanding job of 
handling it. And by the way, he still, on time, deployed the third 
corps to Iraq, and he is right now, today, over there doing our bidding 
and our job of pulling down, making elections work, and pulling down 
the forces for the taking out of 50,000-plus soldiers in August. He is 
a great American and an outstanding soldier.

I want to yield to Mr. King from Iowa however much time he wants to 
take to talk about these issues of radical Islamic jihadism and not 
letting political correctness silence our mouths.
