Mr. DURBIN. The redeployment would take the troops out of Iraq and, 
perhaps, position them in a nearby country. We would still be involved 
in trade, still be involved in hunting down al-Qaida forces and trying 
to stop terrorism. Yes, our feeling is--and I think the Senate vote on 
this--we should begin redeploying troops on a 4-to-6-month basis.
