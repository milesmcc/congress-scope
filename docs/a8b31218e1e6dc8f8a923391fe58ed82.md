# WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yesterday asked by unanimous consent that 
we adopt the Wounded Warrior legislation that was brought to the Senate 
during the Defense authorization bill in a form of a bipartisan 
amendment. A number of Senators worked very hard. Senator Murray is on 
the floor. She worked very hard, and a number of Senators have worked 
very hard on this legislation. It came about as a result of what we 
learned at Walter Reed about how our returning troops from Iraq and 
Afghanistan were being basically neglected. They had been wounded, and 
they were receiving unacceptable and poor treatment when they came 
home. That failure was learned about--not only about the veterans care 
system, which had many bureaucratic failures, but also the physical 
facilities that were there failed to meet a minimum level of 
acceptability. The American people were outraged by the facts that came 
to light, and the Senate took prompt action.

The Wounded Warrior amendment, now in legislation that is before the 
Senate, would address the substandard facilities we have talked about 
and we have seen. It would address the lack of seamless transition and 
develop one when medical care for troops is transferred from the 
Department of Defense to the Veterans' Administration, which oftentimes 
in the past has led to diminished care. It addresses the inadequacy of 
severance pay. It addresses the need for improved sharing of medical 
records between the Department of Defense and the Veterans' 
Administration. We are told now that there are as many as 600,000 
pending claims of returning veterans. It addresses the inadequate care 
and treatment of traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress 
disorder, and a number of other very important items.

So I again renew my request. Yesterday we were told that the 
Republicans were looking at this. Mr. President, I am going to renew 
this request. There are all kinds of reasons, I guess, for objecting to 
something such as this. Now I am told the reason for objecting is the 
pay raise isn't included. The Wounded Warrior legislation becomes 
effective upon passage and approval. The pay raise for the troops 
doesn't become effective until October 1 or January 1--I don't know how 
the legislation reads, but it is not now. So that would not be a good 
reason in my estimation, and I think in the estimation of these wounded 
warriors, for objecting.

The pay raise does not become effective until the beginning of the 
fiscal year. In fact, I think it is January 1 of next year. It is 
different than a number


of things we pass. But it does not become effective now. So if that is 
a reason for objecting, it is a poor reason, because they are two 
different issues. One is the pay raise does not become effective now; 
this does become effective.

So I ask unanimous consent that the Armed Services Committee be 
discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1538, and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consideration; that the substitute amendment 
at the desk, which is the text of the Wounded Warriors provision in 
H.R. 1585, be considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a 
third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; 
and any statements relating to this matter be printed in the Record, 
with no intervening action or debate.
