# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `e0a3d4eda55435f2a9454f486509b519`
`Mr. HOEKSTRA â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to my colleague from 
Michigan, let me make just a couple of comments.

I think, as we all know, the Iraq Study Group did allow for a surge 
in troops on a temporary basis to allow us to achieve our objectives.

Also, as a previous speaker, I was negligent in not acknowledging the 
comments of my colleague from Maryland when he recognized the 
contributions that were being made by our intelligence folks in Iraq 
and around the world.

There are some who believe and are confused by what they may believe 
or perceive to be the callous omission of any reference to the 
contributions being made by our intelligence folks in Iraq today. It is 
a significant shortcoming of this resolution, and I am thoroughly 
confused as to why they would be omitted in this resolution, and their 
contributions. They are working side by side each and every day with 
our Armed Forces, and this resolution forgets to even recognize that 
contribution.

With that, Mr. Speaker, I would now like to recognize my colleague 
from Michigan, a member of the Intelligence Committee, who thoroughly 
recognizes and has met with these people in Iraq and Afghanistan and 
understands their contributions. He is as confused as I am as to why 
they do not want to recognize their contributions. I yield 7 minutes to 
my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Rogers).
