Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I agree again with the statement made and 
respond in the affirmative to the question propounded by the Senator 
from New Hampshire. This Congress has spent 11 months holding Iraq 
political votes that have had no chance of becoming law.

We have had 63 votes thus far this session. In the meantime, while 
the majority has been fiddling, the business of the American people has 
not been done. I think about the issues besides those of national 
security that cry out for solutions, things such as border security and 
immigration reform. Couldn't we have used some of this time more 
constructively to solve one of the biggest domestic issues confronting 
the country today? How about energy policy? We have an energy bill that 
raises taxes on domestic producers and encourages our dependence on 
foreign oil, when we could have worked together to pass an energy 
policy that would have prepared us for the future. We have not done 
that. Health care, which is a tremendous concern of my constituents in 
Texas and elsewhere, we could have acted to deal with the health care 
access cost and quality crisis in this country, but we have not.

I know there are other colleagues who wish to speak.

I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.
