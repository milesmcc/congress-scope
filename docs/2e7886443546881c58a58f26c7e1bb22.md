Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania, 
let me just say, we do have a great chance to work together, that's why 
we were, in fact, proposing an alternative, that being a chance for us 
to work on the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommendations.

With that, I'm happy to yield 4 minutes to my very good friend from 
Erie, Pennsylvania (Mr. English).
