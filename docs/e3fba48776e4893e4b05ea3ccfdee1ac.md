`Mr. AKAKA â€” 1 October 2008`

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Emergency Economic 
Stabilization Act of 2008. While this compromise does not include all 
of what I wanted, we must enact this legislation in an attempt to 
protect our credit markets and our economy.

The administration has not effectively informed the public on why 
this action is needed. The Bush administration has so little trust and 
has been such a bad example of governance, I understand why so many 
people are skeptical. However, this is a time, where due to instability 
and deterioration of the credit markets, we must act. In addition, I 
value the expertise of the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. I 
have enjoyed working with the Chairman during his tenure. I agree with 
his assessment that the situation is as dire as he believes.

Banks and investment banks have failed. Credit has become harder to 
get. Uncertainty and anxiety are high. When Chairman Bernanke and 
Treasury Secretary Paulson came to us and explained how tenuous the 
credit markets are, I understood that we must avert further 
deterioration. It is clear that we must try and prevent the absolute 
collapse of the financial services industry, which would likely lead to 
an even more severe economic downturn, by enacting this bill quickly.

Access to credit is becoming much harder to obtain. Fewer car loans 
are being approved. Small businesses are finding credit to be much more 
expensive and harder to obtain. The State of Hawaii recently delayed 
the sale of bonds due to the poor market conditions.

Our economy cannot function without access to affordable credit. 
Credit helps families buy homes or pay for their child's college 
education. Businesses rely on credit for operations and investments. 
State governments utilize credit to make much needed infrastructure 
improvements.

Without access to affordable credit, businesses will fail, more 
people will become unemployed, and our aging infrastructure will 
continue to deteriorate. We must enact this legislation to improve the 
likelihood of a swift economic recovery and try to avert a severe 
economic contraction.

The original Treasury proposal included no oversight and was not a 
well thought out proposal. It was offensive due to its lack of 
accountability and oversight provisions. The purchase and sale of 
assets has great potential to be abused and lead to corruption. We must 
make sure that this situation, which has been caused partially by 
greed, will not be exploited to further enrich the individuals or 
corporations that caused this situation.

By working together with the Chairman, we have included more 
oversight and accountably provisions to prevent abuse, ensure proper 
management, and reduce conflicts of interest. The legislation includes 
additional reporting requirements to Congress, mandated audits of the 
program by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, and the creation 
of a special treasury Inspector General to oversee the Troubled Assets 
Relief Program, TARP.

We will have to closely monitor this program through aggressive 
oversight by the Banking Committee and other relevant committees. The 
legislation establishes a financial stability oversight board to review 
and make recommendations regarding the exercise of authority by the 
Secretary of Treasury under this act.

Although the Secretary is able to waive provisions of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, FAR, the Secretary would need to provide 
Congress justification for the determination that there are urgent and 
compelling circumstances that make such waiver necessary. This 
justification must be reported to the Committees on Oversight and 
Government Reform and Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Committees on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
Senate within 7 days of the request. Furthermore, if the Secretary 
waives any provisions of the FAR pertaining to minority contracting, 
the Secretary shall develop and implement standards and procedures to 
ensure the inclusion of minority contractors.

Furthermore, under this act, the Secretary will be required, within 2 
business days of exercising his authority, to publicly disclose the 
details of any transaction. It also requires the Comptroller General of 
the United States to conduct ongoing oversight of the activities and 
performance of TARP, report every 60 days to Congress, and conduct an 
annual audit of TARP. It would also establish the Office of the Special 
Inspector General for TARP. This office would be required to conduct, 
supervise, and coordinate audits and investigations of the actions 
undertaken by the Secretary and would report quarterly to Congress. 
This is very important, as we have found with the Special Inspector 
General for Iraq Reconstruction, SIGIR, the SIGIR has been instrumental 
in ensuring oversight of our efforts in Iraq. Establishing a similar 
office to oversee TARP is a critical component to monitor the actions 
approved by this act.

Another important aspect of this proposal is that the authorization 
for TARP is graduated. The Secretary will be able to immediately access 
up to $250 billion. However, for an additional $100 billion, a 
Presidential certification would be needed. The final $350 billion 
could only be accessed if the President transmits a written report to 
Congress requesting such authority. However, should Congress pass a 
joint resolution of disapproval within 15 days of this additional 
authority, the additional authority given to the Secretary may not be 
used.

The Act also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to implement a 
plan to mitigate foreclosures and to encourage servicers of mortgages 
to modify loans through HOPE for Homeowners and other programs. The 
Secretary would also be required to coordinate with other Federal 
entities that hold troubled assets to identify opportunities to modify 
loans. I will continue to advocate for additional relief for homeowners 
so that people can stay in their homes.

Finally, we must reform the financial regulatory system to prevent 
future credit crises from occurring. A lack of effective regulation has 
contributed significantly to the current crisis. This legislation 
establishes a congressional oversight panel to review the state of the 
financial markets, the regulatory system, and the use of authority 
under TARP. The panel is required to report to Congress every 30 days 
and to submit a special report on regulatory reform prior to January 
20, 2009. A comprehensive set of hearings will need to be conducted by 
the Banking Committee during the next session to determine what 
regulator reforms will be necessary to ensure that future Federal 
intervention of this magnitude will not be necessary.

In closing, this is not a perfect bill, but a necessary one to 
protect access to credit and ensure that working families can access 
mortgages and student loans. It is needed so that businesses can access 
credit to pay their expenses and fund expansion. This act is needed to 
help ensure that State governments can afford to finance necessary 
infrastructure improvements.

I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership in helping craft this 
proposal. I also greatly appreciate the efforts made by Senators Reid, 
Schumer, and Reed. I look forward to continuing to work with them and 
the other members of the Banking Committee to oversee and improve the 
troubled asset program.
