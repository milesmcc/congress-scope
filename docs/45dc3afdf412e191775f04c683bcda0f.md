# FOREIGN SHORTFALLS IN IRAQ AID PLEDGES

Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to 
the attention of the House and to the American people a disturbing 
situation involving a shortfall in Iraq aid pledges. I also brought 
this issue to the attention of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, for 
whom I have great respect, during a hearing last month of the House 
Armed Services Committee.

On January 30 of 2008, USA Today reported that allied countries have 
paid only 16 percent of their pledge. Their pledge was $15.8 billion, 
and they have only paid $2.5 billion.

The article further reports, and I quote, ''The biggest shortfall in 
pledges by 41 donor countries are from Iraq's oil rich neighbors and 
U.S. allies,'' namely, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Yet, the United States has already spent $29 billion to help rebuild 
Iraq, and Congress has approved an additional $16.5 billion.

Mr. Speaker, it is troubling that some of the countries that may 
benefit from a secure and stable Iraq, particularly its neighbors in 
the region, are not providing the money they pledged to help achieve 
the goal to rebuild Iraq.

Unlike the United States, which is borrowing money from foreign 
governments to pay its bills, many of Iraq's neighbors are running 
record surpluses because of profits flowing into their government 
coffers by their national oil companies. These countries have the 
economic resources to meet their commitments.

In a letter on February 8, 2008, I expressed these concerns to 
Secretary Condoleezza Rice and to President Bush.



















 House of Representatives,

















 Washington, DC, February 8, 2008.


 Hon. Condoleezza Rice,


 Secretary of State,


 Washington, DC



 Dear Madam Secretary: I am writing to express my concern 


 over information reported January 30, 2008, in the USA Today 


 article, ''Allies fall short on Iraq aid pledges.'' According 


 to the article, during and after an October 2003 conference 


 in Madrid, allied countries pledged $15.8 billion to help 


 rebuild Iraq. Now almost five years later, allied countries 


 have paid only 16%, or $2.5 billion, of those pledges. The 


 article also states: ''The biggest shortfalls in pledges by 


 41 donor countries are from Iraq's oil-rich neighbors and 


 U.S. allies.''





 While the United States has spent $29 billion to help 


 rebuild Iraq, and Congress has approved an additional $16.5 


 billion, it is troubling that some of the countries that may 


 benefit the most from a secure and stable Iraq--particularly 


 its neighbors in the region--are not providing the money they 


 pledged to help achieve that goal. It's not as though these 


 nations lack the economic resources to meet their 


 commitments; in fact many of Iraq's neighbors are running 


 record surpluses as a result of the windfall profits flowing 


 into their government coffers via their national oil 


 companies.



 Madam Secretary, I have no doubt that you and others in the 


 Administration are working to make sure those who promised 


 money to rebuild Iraq actually make good on those promises. 


 Therefore, I respectfully request that you provide me with a 


 written update of the Administration's efforts in this 


 regard. Thank you in advance for your consideration.





 Sincerely,

























Walter B. Jones,























 Member of Congress.


I look forward to hearing the administration's response and an update 
on what steps they are taking to insure the Arab countries fulfill 
their pledges to aid Iraq. Our government should be working to make 
sure that those who promised money to help rebuild Iraq actually make 
good on those promises.

While oil is at a record high of near $104 a barrel, American 
taxpayers are facing prices of more than $3 at the pump.

Mr. Speaker, out of fairness to the American taxpayer, it is time 
that the administration tell these Arab countries that they are running 
record surpluses, that they need to pay their bills in Iraq. Again, 
they pledged $15.8 billion. They have only paid $2.5 billion. And the 
poor taxpayer of America is having to foot the bill to rebuild Iraq. It 
is not right, and it's time that we ask those rich Arab countries to 
meet their responsibilities.
