Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.

We have just provided $2.863 billion in emergency supplemental 
appropriations for Iraq's diplomatic operations and reconstruction. As 
the gentleman has accurately noted in committee, the funding in this 
supplemental is tied up due to benchmarks; benchmarks that reflect the 
will of the American people and the Congress; benchmarks that 
presumably reflect the President's concurrence, as he signed them into 
law; benchmarks that can be argued are in the best interest of Iraq in 
becoming a stable democracy.



Furthermore, I believe the gentleman's argument is not valid, as the 
$2.863 billion we just provided will be available long before this bill 
comes back from the President's desk signed. Additionally, while I 
believe we provided sufficient funds for Iraq, I want to point out that 
the administration should substantially expend the funds that we have 
provided before Congress provides additional funding for the exact same 
purposes. Besides, Congress provided an extension of the authority to 
deobligate and then to reobligate prior-year appropriations to the Iraq 
Relief Construction Fund, which, as of May 1, 2007, had $3.119 billion 
in unexpended balances.

In the committee, the gentleman raised the issue of visible support, 
as my last colleague raised in his remarks. I take a little bit of 
offense to that, because I think that every day our troops, our 
diplomats and aid workers are in harm's way, we show the greatest 
levels of support. What's more, none of the funding in the gentleman's 
amendment would go towards providing a safer environment for our men 
and women serving in the country of Iraq. We just provided $2.863 
billion.

So let's take the gentleman's amendment apart for a moment and be 
clear on what we are considering. This amendment is requesting $140 
million in additional funding for democracy, rule of law and governance 
programs. The supplemental provides $250 million for democracy 
activities; $67.6 million for civil society, and $57.4 million targeted 
for development, $125 million in governance programs, and $150 million 
in rule of law activities.

On page 58, line 18, the amendment is requesting $16 million in 
additional funding for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, and demining 
activities. I want to make a couple of points about that.

The recently passed supplemental provided $7 million for demining in 
Iraq. We do not appropriate nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining-
related program accounts by country. We appropriate this account by 
program to allow the administration the flexibility to adjust to 
emerging priorities and opportunities. This amendment would seek to 
change that and radically affects how the President performs his 
duties.

Additionally, this bill, and I want to emphasize this, this bill for 
the first time fully funds the President's request for NADR, something 
I would note that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle could 
not claim when they were in the majority. The humanitarian demining 
account is funded at the President's requested level of $56.5 million. 
It does not need further funding.

On page 63, line 23, of the gentleman's amendment, where he requests 
an additional $2 million, the amendment is requesting this $2 million 
for foreign language training of Iraqi Security Forces. To date, we 
have provided $18 billion in training for the Iraqi Security Forces. $2 
million. Where does this figure come from? We have provided $18 
billion, and, now the distinguished ranking member seeks an additional 
$2 million.

We have provided sufficient funding. Most of these accounts and 
numbers are unexpended. The administration should substantially expend 
those funds we have provided before Congress


provides additional funding for the exact same purposes, Mr. Chairman.

Lastly, what is more, none of the funding in the gentleman's 
amendment would go toward providing a safer environment for our men and 
women serving in the country of Iraq.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Lowey) for 
yielding.
