`Mr. ALTMIRE â€” 8 March 2007`

---


Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, with Democrats now in control of 
Congress, oversight is finally being conducted. The new Democratic 
Congress has already held 81 separate hearings on important issues 
involving the war in Iraq, including the billions of dollars that are 
unaccounted for. The documented pattern of neglect at Walter Reed goes 
back at least 3 years, yet previous Congresses did nothing. But just 
this week the new Congress held four separate hearings on the treatment 
of our wounded soldiers.

Also, this week the House held hearings on the firing of seven U.S. 
attorneys for purely political reasons. Partisanship and politics have 
no place in our justice system, and this House is going to aggressively 
investigate this situation.

Madam Speaker, this level of oversight is part of the Democrats' 
effort to bring real change to Washington. Two months into the new 
Congress, we are already delivering on that promise.
