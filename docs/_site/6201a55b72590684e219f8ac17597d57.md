Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage of a 
brave and dedicated hero of the Fort Worth community and of our Nation.

SGT Glenn D. Hicks, Jr., was a proud U.S. Army soldier and a true 
American hero who gallantly gave his life for his country on April 28, 
2007, during combat operations in Salman Park, Iraq.

Assigned to the Third Infantry Division, Glenn enlisted during a time 
of war, which speaks volumes about his character and patriotism.

Moreover, he was a leader and mentor to younger soldiers and his 
service as a sergeant--the backbone of the Army, exemplifies that 
spirit.

Sergeant Hicks is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Glenn D. 
Hicks, Sr., three brothers and his grandparents.

Our thoughts and prayers are with them and all of Glenn's family and 
friends.

Our community and Nation honor Sergeant Hicks' memory and we are 
grateful for his faithful and distinguished service to America.

SGT Glenn D. Hicks will never be forgotten. his memory lives on 
through his family and the legacy of selfless service that he so 
bravely imprinted on our hearts.
