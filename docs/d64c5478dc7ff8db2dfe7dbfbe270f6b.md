Mr. REID. I appreciate the kind comments of my friend from 
Connecticut. He is one of our most articulate spokespersons we have in 
the Senate and always has been. I have enjoyed my work with him.

This is a very difficult issue. The American public is terribly 
concerned about this issue because it is easy to focus on. What has 
taken place in this country the last 7 years has really hurt the 
confidence of the American people in their Government.

We have the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the 
country in the invasion of Iraq. We are spending now $12 billion a 
month there.

We have now a condition where much of the Government has been 
contracted out. The poster for that, of course, is Blackwater. I heard 
an account on the radio this morning that the Iraqis can't tell the 
difference between the American troops and these contractors, and all 
the contractors do is hurt them--not the troops but these contractors.

We have had this domestic surveillance situation, which is really 
frightening to people. In Nevada, we don't like wiretaps. We don't like 
lie detector tests. We are very private people. I think that is 
basically where America is. They don't like their privacy invaded.

We all want to get the bad guys. We know there are evil people out 
there trying to hurt us. The patriotism of the Senator from Connecticut 
and the Senator from Nevada will compare to that of anyone else in the 
Senate. Because we believe this retroactive immunity is something that 
needs to be studied very closely, that doesn't mean we are any less 
patriotic than anyone else.

This is an issue on which the American people are focused. I have 
gotten, in the last week or so, thousands of inquiries from around the 
country. This is an issue they understand and they do not like. 
Hopefully, when we come back after the first of the year, we can figure 
out a way to move through this. We know we have to do something, but we 
can't continue to make mistakes in this regard that continually take 
away the confidence of the American people in what we are doing back 
here.
