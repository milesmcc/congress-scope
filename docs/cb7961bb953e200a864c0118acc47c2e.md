`Mr. KAUFMAN â€” 17 June 2010`

---


Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Senator.

Madam President, when I was appointed to the Senate, I made a promise 
to myself not to let this opportunity pass without helping to recognize 
the contribution made to this Nation by its government workers. This is 
why I began my weekly ''great Federal employee'' series last May.

In all my years working as a Federal employee, I have met so many 
wonderful individuals who have dedicated their careers to working for 
the American people. So many are deserving but will not make it onto 
the poster I bring to the Senate floor each week commemorating great 
Federal employees simply because there are so many of them.

Over the years, as I have witnessed countless acts of personal 
courage, devotion to country, and real sacrifice, I have also seen and 
heard such disheartening and baseless attacks against those who choose 
to serve.

The pending amendment is just the latest assault. It comes on the 
heels of a new myth being peddled on television, on talk radio, in 
print, and on this very floor--the allegation that somehow Federal 
employees are overpaid; that their salaries have been rising unfairly 
compared to those with similar jobs in the private sector; that we 
should freeze or cut their pay or lay them off; that we should make it 
nearly impossible to hire any new government worker at all.

Before I rebut these arguments piecemeal, I remind my colleagues and 
the American people what we are talking about. This is not an exercise 
in the abstract. There are concrete facts. There are names, faces, and 
real life stories of achievement and hard work.

Nearly 2 million wake up every day and go to work for the American 
people, for their neighbors, their friends and family, for folks they 
have never met or will never meet.

They do it for substantially less pay than the same job in the 
private sector and with considerably more at stake. As I have said 
before, there are no Wall Street bonuses, and there is rarely ever 
recognition for their hard work. For many, working as a Federal 
employee is a tough choice.

In his keynote address at the annual dinner on Monday honoring the 
winners of this year's Arthur S. Flemming Awards for public service, 
NIST physicist Dr. William Phillips--whom I honored as a great Federal 
employee this past December--told his audience about a colleague who 
decided to work for the Federal Government. This scientist had been 
working most of his early career in the private sector. At a certain 
point, he realized it was more important for him to make a difference 
and serve his country, so he went to work in a government lab.

He told Dr. Phillips that, to do so, he took a pay cut that was a 
factor of 10.

That is 10 times less pay. I am sure it was a difficult decision, but 
ultimately he made the choice to work for his country.

I met an appointee the other day who is taking a 95 percent pay cut. 
I have constantly been amazed by the number of highly skilled and 
highly experienced individuals willing to take 20, 40, 60 percent 
salary cuts to work in the Obama Administration. These political 
appointees join the career personnel, so many of who would also be 
making much more in the private sector.

Just look at some of those I have honored as great Federal employees 
this past year.

By the way, I do not pick the people at the top of the spectrum. When 
I honor a great Federal employee, it is at any level in the government. 
Anybody who does their job well should be honored. We have so many 
great Federal employees who operate at all levels of government that I 
try to honor them all.

I am hard pressed to think of any who would not be making a lot more 
in the private sector. Not only do we have brilliant physicists such as 
Dr. William Phillips who won a Nobel Prize. We also have those such as 
Brian Persons, the executive director of NAVSEA who has spent his 
career designing and maintaining our Navy's ships and who holds an 
engineering degree from Michigan State. Or Erica Williams, an 
enforcement attorney with the SEC with a degree from the University of 
Virginia Law School, who I am sure could be making a lot more if she 
worked for a Wall Street firm. Or Judge Timothy Rice, a Temple Law 
School graduate who could have chosen to work as an attorney in private 
practice but, instead, went to work for the Justice Department and on 
the Federal bench.

I am not saying that all Federal employees earn 10 times less than 
their private sector counterparts. I am not even saying all Federal 
employees earn less.

Still, those who claim that Federal employees are making more on 
average than private sector counterparts simply don't have all their 
facts straight. We know how these things happen. In this case, much of 
the data used to make these claims are from a USA Today study a few 
months ago, which analyzed findings from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics.

The big problem with that study is that it is both highly selective 
of the job categories compared and it fails to take into account the 
demographics of our Federal workforce.

The number of employees in various private sector job categories 
dwarfs that of the Federal Government, skewing salary data lower for 
the private sector, where there are more minimum wage jobs. Also, a 
large number of Federal jobs require highly specialized skills and, as 
a result, employees are often older and more educated than the average 
worker in comparable private sector roles.

Many Americans do not realize that about 20 percent of Federal 
employees hold a master's or professional degree, compared to 13 
percent in the private sector. Fifty-one percent of Federal employees 
have at least a bachelor's degree, while this is true for only 35 
percent of the private sector workforce.

In the words of Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for 
Public Service which, by the way, is a nonpartisan organization this is 
''not an apples-to-apples comparison.''

You cannot simply ask what the average salaries for budget analysts 
are in the private sector and for budget analysts in government. The 
same goes for librarians or statisticians or paralegals.

The occupational categories might be called by the same name, but the 
work is very different. There are different skill sets required, 
different types of experience necessary.

When actual job tasks are compared, few government jobs have exact 
equivalents in the private sector.

Contrary to what many have said, Federal workers' salaries are 
actually


lower, not higher, than those in the private sector.

Indeed, the Federal Salary Council reported last October that Federal 
employees were making an average of over 26 percent--less--than those 
in the private sector doing comparable work. Moreover, this represents 
a widening of the private-public pay gap from the previous year, 
continuing a recent trend.

However, this line of attack continues from those who routinely 
disparage the role of government. Unfortunately, it has become all too 
common to criticize Washington by defaming the civilian employees who 
work across our government.

Federal employees continue to serve as a convenient scapegoat. That, 
essentially, is what this amendment does. It assigns blame and does not 
really address the budgetary problems we face.

It reminds me of an amendment proposed by one of my friends on the 
other side of the aisle when we were considering the health insurance 
reform bill. It would have mandated that ''for each new bureaucrat 
added to any department or agency for the purpose of implementing the 
provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the head 
of such department or agency shall ensure that the addition of such new 
bureaucrat is offset by a reduction of one existing bureaucrat at such 
department or agency.''

In effect, we would have to fire a Federal worker to hire one. This 
so-called ''bureaucrat offset'' amendment--using a word that has 
become, unfortunately, pejorative in our political discourse--was bad 
enough.

The Thune amendment, with its blanket pay freeze and hiring caps, 
takes this a step further, prohibiting any Federal agency from hiring a 
new employee until one retires.

At a moment when we are faced with a difficult choice about how to 
reduce our deficit and get our economy moving again, this amendment 
represents an easy cop-out.

All those who blame Federal employees for our Nation's problems or 
believe that cutting their salaries or capping their number will in any 
way solve those problems remain averse to making difficult decisions.

The cuts to the Federal workforce in the Thune amendment would only 
save the taxpayers a meager amount compared to what we need to save. 
Its provisions on the Federal workforce and the ongoing, gratuitous 
disparagement of America's public employees from many directions 
constitute a dangerous distraction from the very tough steps we as a 
nation must take.

The greatest challenges we face today--the gulf spill, two wars, 
carbon pollution, illegal immigration, market volatility--all of these 
will be tackled by hardworking Federal employees.

All of these challenges require a readiness on our part to make 
difficult choices. Scapegoating and playing the blame game won't get us 
anywhere.

Federal employees know firsthand about making tough choices. They do 
so every day. Many of the great Federal employees I have honored from 
this desk came to my attention because they faced difficult tasks, took 
risks, and achieved great accomplishments. Some of those I honored have 
served overseas in dangerous regions; one gave his life while working 
for USAID. One left a lucrative private sector job after September 11th 
to join the Justice Department as an anti-terror prosecutor. Others 
immigrated to this country from places like Afghanistan and Vietnam and 
became Federal employees because they wanted to give back to the 
country that took them in as refugees.

These stories go on and on. They are as diverse and numerous as this 
great country of ours.

Additionally, all of my honorees share with every other government 
employee the experience of making that initial decision to pursue 
government work hardly an easy one to make considering the sacrifices 
involved.

Ultimately, those who support Federal salary cuts and hiring caps 
mistakenly view our civil service as a cost. Rather, it is an important 
national resource with real benefits for all of us.

At the end of the day, I must remind my colleagues that it is our 
outstanding Federal employees who will carry out the programs we pass 
everyday in this Chamber. We will continue to count on the Federal 
workforce to keep our skies safe for travel, our troops provisioned and 
veterans cared for, our schools held to high standards, and our 
homeland secure.

Woodrow Wilson, as a young political scientist during the civil 
service reform debates of the 1880s, advocated for a system of public 
administration because he believed that the conditions of modernity 
require it in order for a democratic state to function at its best.

Indeed, our civil service has developed into one uniquely suited to 
our needs and incorporating America's best constitutional traditions. 
We have a Federal workforce of which we can be proud.

Federal employees play a critical role in our national life and, 
through their work, exemplify so many of our Nation's great values. 
These include exemplary citizenship; industriousness; a willingness to 
take risks; perseverance; modesty; and intellect.

Contrary to popular myth, most Federal employees work outside of 
Washington. In fact, no State--and I include the District of Columbia--
no State is home to more than 8.5 percent of the total Federal 
workforce. Our government employees work in communities large and 
small, spread out from coast to coast and overseas.

One of the challenges we face is a Federal retirement boom. As the 
baby boomers get older, the Office of Personnel Management has 
estimated that one-fifth of the Federal workforce will retire by 2014. 
This comes at the same time that more new hires are needed in mission-
critical jobs dealing with public health, national security, 
transportation safety, financial regulation, and many other important 
areas.

Now is not the time to talk about laying off Federal workers or 
freezing their pay. We should be talking about how to invest in 
recruiting the next generation of Federal employees.

The scapegoating and baseless attacks against Federal workers only 
serve to demoralize those who are on the front lines of confronting our 
national challenges. It also discourages talented young Americans from 
making that difficult choice whether to start a career in service to 
their country.

Let me reiterate. Federal employees make less than those in the 
private sector, not more. They represent some of our very best and 
brightest, a dedicated and hard-working group of Americans across this 
country. We need to recruit a new generation of government workers to 
help us tackle great challenges, and unfairly labeling Federal 
employees as a problem fails to realize their important role in finding 
so many solutions to the very difficult problems we face. The pending 
amendment's pay freeze and hiring restrictions will do almost nothing 
to reduce our deficit; rather, its effect on our government's ability 
to address serious issues will be disastrous.

For those looking to shift the blame for our troubles and who have 
their sights on America's Federal employees, I suggest look elsewhere.

For those who want easy, let's-deal-with-this-later answers and are 
looking for a convenient distraction, I say look elsewhere.

For those who support this amendment, for those who habitually shy 
away from making the tough choices we in this Chamber need to make, I 
say, though, look no further than the public employees you so casually 
fault.

They know how to make tough choices.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask 
unanimous consent that it be charged against both sides.
