`Mr. DURBIN â€” 5 February 2007`

---


Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say, for those who have not 
followed this debate closely, I think we have made amazing progress 
until today--until today--because what happened before today was that 
we were moving on a bipartisan track, a track of cooperation, so that 
the Senate would exercise its responsibility and deliberate a topic 
that is being debated today in Springfield, IL, and Little Rock, AR. 
That is the war.

In an effort to reach this point, we have made accommodations. 
Senators Biden, Levin, and Hagel worked long and hard on a resolution 
of disapproval of the President's policy. They reported it from the 
Foreign Relations Committee. Yet, we set that aside and said, in the 
interest of comity, in the interest of fairness, we will gather behind 
Senator John Warner, the former chairman of the Armed Services 
Committee, in a bipartisan fashion, and we will work together so we 
bring one resolution of disapproval to the floor.

Senator Warner was kind enough to make some modifications in that 
resolution, and we were prepared to proceed. We felt that was fair. 
Throughout this process, we have not been asserting the rights of the 
majority. We have tried to work in a bipartisan fashion.

So now comes the moment of truth. Will the Senate, after all the 
sound and fury, finally have a debate? Now we are told by the 
Republican side, no. We are told by the Republican side that because 
they have several other amendments they want to have brought up, they 
will stop any debate on the Warner resolution unless they have their 
way on the procedure.

I am troubled by this. If the Republicans in the Senate cannot 
swallow the thin soup of the Warner resolution, how will they ever 
stomach a real debate on the war in Iraq?

What we face now is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.

It is important. It expresses the feeling of the Senate. But it is 
not going to change the situation on the ground. The President will not 
be held back from sending the troops that he wants to escalate the war, 
nor will there be any money moved from one place to another, nor any 
limits on the troops, nor any of the changes that have been discussed.

What we started to do here was to have a sense-of-the-Senate 
resolution, a bipartisan resolution, introduced by Senator Warner on 
the Republican side, as the basis for this debate. How much more good 
faith could we show on the majority side? And yet now we find that the 
Republicans have objected. We are witness to the spectacle of a White 
House and Republican Senators unwilling to even engage in a debate on a 
war that claims at least one American life every day and $2.5 billion a 
week.

As we debate the procedures, as we go back and forth, day by day, we 
lose more soldiers and spend more money. I am sorry there is no sense 
of urgency on both sides of the aisle to move this matter to debate 
quickly. If the Republicans want to stand by their President and his 
policy, they should not run from this debate. If they believe we should 
send thousands of our young soldiers into the maws of this wretched 
civil war, they should at least have the courage to stand and defend 
their position.

One of their own on the Republican side, speaking before the Foreign 
Relations Committee, said he felt it was a matter of responsibility. He 
said: We are Senators, not shoe salesmen. I do not want to reflect 
poorly on entrepreneurs in America by referring to shoe salesmen in a 
derogatory way, but I would join in his remarks. If we cannot come 
together today and begin the debate on the single issue that is 
paramount in the minds of people across America, why are we here? What 
are we waiting for?


We have certainly tantalized them with the prospects of a debate. And 
now to have the Republicans pull the rug out from under us at the last 
minute and say, no debate this week, well, they understand, as we do, 
the continuing resolution is imminent. We have no time to wait. We have 
to move to it. And if they can slow us down and stall us for a few more 
days, then the White House gets its way: no deliberation, no debate, no 
vote.

The final thing I will say is this: Some on the other side have 
argued this is a vote of no confidence in the President and the troops. 
They could not be further from the truth. I cannot believe that Senator 
Warner, a man who has served his country so well in so many capacities, 
would be party to a resolution which would express no confidence in the 
troops of this Nation. I would not be. He would not either.

This resolution expresses our confidence and our faithfulness in 
those men and women in uniform. Nor is it a vote of no confidence in 
this President. Of course it is his policy. But what we should debate--
and we will debate--is the policy itself, not the personalities 
involved. But for the Republicans, now in their minority status, to put 
a stop to this debate is to try to put a stop to a debate that is going 
on across America.

I will tell them this. They may succeed today, but they will not 
succeed beyond today. There will be a debate on this war. It may not be 
this week; it may not be this bill; it may not be this resolution. 
There will be a debate because the American people made it clear in the 
last election it is time for a new direction.

Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.
