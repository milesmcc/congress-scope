# AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL FOR A CEREMONY TO  HONOR THE 5 YEARS OF SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF OUR TROOPS AND THEIR  FAMILIES IN THE WAR IN IRAQ AND TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO ARE SERVING OUR  NATION IN AFGHANISTAN AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, I reserve the right to object, but I will 
not object. I simply want to point out this is a very important thing 
that we should do for our troops. I'm delighted that someone has 
suggested that we use the rotunda for this purpose.

We all know how difficult it has been for the troops in both 
Afghanistan and Iraq and in other parts of the world. We also know that 
there is not universal support in our country for the work that they 
are doing, and this makes their job doubly difficult. So I'm very 
pleased to support this resolution and make certain that we truly and 
properly honor the work of our Armed Forces and their families 
throughout the world when they work in such difficult circumstances.
