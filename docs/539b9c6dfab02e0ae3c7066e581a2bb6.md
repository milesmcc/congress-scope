Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Louis Wolfgram, a 
Vietnam War Army and National Guard veteran from Boone County, Iowa, 
and to express my appreciation for his dedication and commitment to his 
country.



The Boone News Republican is currently running a series of articles 
that honors one Boone County veteran every Tuesday from Memorial Day to 
Veterans Day. Louis Wolfgram was recognized on Tuesday, June 22. Below 
is the article in its entirety:









 Boone County Veterans: Louis Wolfgram













(By Alexander Hutchins)




 Louis Wolfgram, 60, Command Sergeant Major (retired) of the 


 Iowa National Guard, has recently returned to State Active 


 duty on Retiree Recall after retiring on his 60th birthday 


 June ninth.



 Wolfgram was born in Sumner, Iowa to a family with nine 


 children. His father had served in the Army Air Corps in 


 World War II, but Wolfgram was the only child out of his 


 eight siblings that served in the military. Wolfgram's father 


 owned a grocery store in Sumner.



 ''He saw the writing on the wall that the small-town 


 grocery was going to disappear and went into insurance,'' 


 Wolfgram said. The family moved to Jefferson, Iowa and then 


 Boone. In 1968 Wolfgram graduated Ryan High School.



 One year later, in 1969, he was drafted.



 On January 28 of 1970 Wolfgram went on Active Duty and 


 proceeded to receive training in accounting and stock control 


 after a stint in Fort Des Moines, Fort Lewis and Fort Lee. 


 After being trained to do both manual and mechanical 


 accounting (using computers he described as half the size of 


 a table) he received two weeks leave and then deployed to 


 Vietnam.



 Wolfgram received his choice of specialty in the Army, but 


 in exchange for his preference in duty he made a three-year 


 commitment to the Army rather than the standard two. Wolfgram 


 served for 18 months in Vietnam at a large supply post in a 


 rear area of Vietnam.



 ''I was a logistician,'' he said. ''We pulled perimeter 


 guard and did sweeps in the morning. I wasn't out beating the 


 bush like the infantry guys were.''



 When he returned from two years in Vietnam, Wolfgram was 


 offered the option of serving a year at Fort Hood, a year in 


 Germany or leaving the Army a year early. Wolfgram took the 


 option to leave the service, but says now he regrets not 


 joining the National Guard immediately after leaving the 


 Army.



 ''I was out for about five years,'' Wolfgram said, and 


 during this time he worked for John Deere.



 In October of 1977 he joined the National Guard, where he 


 is still serving after his retirement.



 Wolfgram said some of his fondest experiences are his 


 travels throughout the U.S. and to Norway, Japan and Korea. 


 He has been working full-time in the National Guard since 


 1986.



 ''The floods of '93 were a real, major event, just with all 


 the manpower the guard put out there and the situations that 


 we put our soldiers in that could have been catastrophic,'' 


 Wolfgram said.



 He served as the Task Force Command Sergeant Major for the 


 National Guard in Des Moines at the time of the flood and was 


 impressed by how lucky the soldiers were in all the dangerous 


 work they did fighting the flood.



 Wolfgram said he was especially proud of the work he did 


 with the Iowa Military Academy and the opportunities he has 


 received through the academy to train younger soldiers in 


 leadership roles. Wolfgram served two years as the Enlisted 


 Senior Instructor for the Academy.



 ''That was a fruitful time in my career,'' he said.



 Wolfgram was also assigned for 14 years in the Boone Army 


 National Guard base as a supply and food service 


 administrator.



 ''You see a lot of happy faces when guys get good chow,'' 


 he said with a laugh.



 Before his retirement, Wolfgram was serving as an enlisted 


 advisor to the Judge Adjutant General of the Iowa Guard, 


 advising the commander of the Iowa Guard on meeting the needs 


 of the soldiers.



 In 1990 Wolfgram earned his degree in business and 


 accounting, partly due to the credits he earned while serving 


 in the Guard. He said he appreciated his education and all 


 the opportunities he received to work with his leadership 


 skills.



 ''One thing I regret is not joining the guard immediately 


 after leaving active duty, and the other is that I didn't get 


 to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,'' he said. ''Some people 


 would say 'You're nuts for wanting to do that,' but it's part 


 of what you swore in for and signed up for.''



 He said it is important to remember that many soldiers do 


 not deploy, and he is always impressed working with combat 


 veterans of previous eras.



 For the past ten years Wolfgram has worked on the military 


 funerals honor team, work that has given him tremendous 


 respect for the men and women who deploy overseas.



 Wolfgram was most impressed with how well prepared and 


 supported the soldiers of today are, something he is acutely 


 aware of after his time in Vietnam. He and his wife currently 


 care for two of their grandchildren, and he said he will 


 enjoy taking them out boating this summer, as well as finally 


 being able to grow a beard.


I commend Louis Wolfgram for his many years of loyalty and service to 
our great Nation. It is an immense honor to represent him in the United 
States Congress, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
