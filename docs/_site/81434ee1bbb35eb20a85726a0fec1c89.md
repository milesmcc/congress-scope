`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 5 September 2007`

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I speak today with great sorrow as we 
have lost a great American. A Fort Dodge native, Marine Sergeant Jon 
''J.J.'' Bonnell died while serving his country in Iraq on August 7, 
2007. Sergeant Bonnell stepped on a roadside bomb while on duty between 
Baghdad and Fallujah. He was part of the 1st Battalion, 11th Marine 
Regiment, based in Camp Pendleton CA. My prayers and deepest sympathy 
go out to J.J.'s parents, Jon Bonnell, Sr., and Denise Roark, as well 
as to his three sisters and all his family and friends. I also wish to 
express my sympathy to the community of Fort Dodge, who not only lost a 
fine young man, but an exemplary soldier.

J.J. will be remembered fondly and missed dearly. Only 22 years old, 
multiple students at Fort Dodge Senior High School referred to J.J. as 
a ''hero,'' a label he greatly deserves. Making the ultimate sacrifice, 
J.J. deserves the gratitude of every American. An uncle described J.J. 
by saying ''He loved doing what he did, and he gave the ultimate 
sacrifice. He said he was ready for the ultimate sacrifice.'' This 
speaks volumes for J.J.'s character, and we as Iowans and Americans are 
fortunate and honored to have a man with J.J.'s devotion and dedication 
serving our Nation.

J.J. enlisted in the Marine Corps as a senior in high school in 2003. 
He assisted victims of the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia after his 
first tour in Iraq. A deeply dedicated marine, his grandmother 
recounted that J.J. ''thought all the marines were heroes.'' On behalf 
of all Iowans, I offer my most sincere appreciation for J.J.'s service 
to our Nation. I ask my colleagues in the Senate, and every American, 
to take a moment and remember with honor and gratitude the ultimate 
sacrifice of a true patriot, Sgt. Jon Bonnell, Jr.
