Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, our military men and 
women are fighting in Afghanistan to defeat terrorists overseas and 
protect families here at home. Having visited my former unit, the 218th 
Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard, during their year-
long deployment, I know firsthand that our servicemembers in 
Afghanistan are doing incredible work along with the Afghani police and 
army units they train.

In March, when President Obama announced his strategy for 
Afghanistan, I commended the President for moving forward with the plan 
based on the counsel of military leadership on the ground. In light of 
the recent reports that General Stanley McChrystal has requested 
additional forces, I hope we continue to heed the advice of our 
commanders in Afghanistan. We must provide the level of force and 
resources necessary to help our brave military complete their mission. 
We cannot allow the terrorists to establish a safe haven from which to 
attack America and our allies.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
