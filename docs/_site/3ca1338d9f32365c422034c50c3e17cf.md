Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, our men and women in 
uniform deserve our wholehearted, unequivocal support protecting our 
freedoms. Our distinguished colleague, former Vietnam POW, Congressman 
Sam Johnson, has filed a discharge petition to bring to the floor of 
the House his bill, which declares to the United States Armed Forces 
that Congress will fully fund and support their mission. Unlike the 
proposed supplemental bill which undercuts our military, the Johnson 
legislation provides Members the opportunity to cast a clear vote in 
support of our troops.

As a 31-year veteran and also the father of four sons in the 
military, including one that served in Iraq, I understand the 
importance of supporting our troops. Bin Laden and his cohorts are 
committed to our destruction, declaring the Iraq war as the third world 
war and the central front in the global war on terrorism. Democrats and 
Republicans should work together to promote our troops' success to 
protect American families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
