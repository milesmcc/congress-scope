Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of 
The Congressional Progressive Caucus Fiscal Year 2008-17 ''Peace & 
Security'' Budget Alternative. The American people spoke loud and clear 
last November. They wanted change, accountability, and a new course of 
action. This budget is a direct answer to the demands of the American 
people and steers us in a new direction. With this budget we can usher 
in a new era of fiscal responsibility that this current administration 
has failed to adhere to. The budget is morally sound, as it redirects 
funding to domestic spending programs that benefit the American middle 
class, the backbone of our great Nation. Most importantly this budget 
meets our moral obligation to all of our veterans. This budget ends the 
war and brings our troops home and moves this country toward an agenda 
of peace and security.

The news of the horrible living conditions at Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center raised our national consciousness regarding the need to 
do more--much more--for wounded and injured service members and to 
upgrade the administrative systems that support them. Simply put, this 
budget treats the heroic young men and women who sacrifice life and 
limb with the respect and dignity they deserve. This budget guarantees 
full funding for health care (including mental health care) for all 
veterans. The Progressive Caucus budget makes veterans' health care a 
new federal entitlement. It will require the U.S. Secretary of the 
Treasury to make mandatory appropriations for VA health care based upon 
the following formula: the amount of funds available for VA medical 
care in FY2008 would equal 130 percent of the total obligations made by 
the VA for medical care programs in FY2005.

Let us send the right message to our young men and women returning 
home from Iraq and Afghanistan. They deserve better, we owe it to them, 
and we have a duty to answer the will of the American people.
