Mr. PERLMUTTER. Good evening to my friends from the freshmen class. 
And I just want to say I listened to my friend from Minnesota as well 
as my friend from Vermont, and the reason we are here, the reason Mr. 
Ellison is here, the reason Mr. Welch is here, Mr. Klein is here, Mr. 
Hodes is here is because this Nation wanted checks and balances, and 
checks and balances means accountability.

There has been no accountability in Washington for the last 6 years; 
and as a result, we have had a variety of problems that have continued 
to arise again and again and again and again. And we can start with the 
no-bid contracts in Iraq, and the fact that there is some $10 billion 
that has evaporated into the ether. That is the kind of thing that we 
have to stop, and that is the kind of thing that the people of America 
voted to bring a Democratic Congress into being so that there were 
checks and balances to these no-bid contracts; checks and balances to a 
loss, a complete loss, of $10 billion, the whereabouts of which we are 
going to try to find, as the Congress of the United States of America 
is supposed to do, so that we act as a counterbalance to the executive 
branch. We aren't just here as a rubber stamp.

So start with Iraq. Let us talk about Katrina and the response that 
was just a horrible failure by this administration to a massive 
disaster in the United States of America, and the response after the 
disaster occurred has also been a disaster. As a member of the 
Financial Services Committee, it is clear that now we are 19 months 
after the hurricane which basically decimated New Orleans and many 
cities along the gulf coast, and yet we have not reconstructed, 
renovated, rebuilt much of the housing that was completely obliterated 
in that storm. So not only was the initial response a poor one, but 
after that the response has been very minimal and has to be improved. 
That is what checks and balances are about.

Checks and balances are when an administration, for whatever reason, 
releases the name of a CIA agent to punish her, to punish her husband, 
to whatever. It is completely wrong and needs to be stopped. And that 
is why people expect accountability in our government and they like 
checks and balances.

We have had revelations, Mr. Klein, over the past 2 or 3 weeks as to 
some of the conditions, particularly at Walter Reed but other veteran 
hospitals. Again, checks and balances and accountability would rein in 
excesses or neglect, one or the other. We have seen far too much of it. 
And we, as part of this freshmen class, are bringing those checks and 
balances back.

Now, obviously the other side doesn't like it. My friends on the 
Republican side, today they have been complaining with no end as to the 
approach we are taking to bring benchmarks to this war in Iraq. And 
they are complaining and complaining and complaining. But, finally, 
there are going to be checks and balances on this President and the way 
he has conducted the war in Iraq.

We are supporting our troops. We are supporting the veterans, and we 
are bringing conditions and accountability to the administration and 
accountability to the Iraqi people, as it is time for them to pick up 
what we have been carrying now for the last 4 years.

The American people understand checks and balances. They were tired 
of one-party government that led to excesses and neglect. We are here 
to provide accountability. That is exactly what we are doing. The 
administration doesn't like it. My friends across the aisle don't like 
it. But that is what the people sent us here to do, and that is 
precisely what we are doing.

And with that, Mr. Klein, my friend from Florida, I would like to 
yield back to you or to any of our other friends who are on the floor 
with us tonight to talk about why we are here.
