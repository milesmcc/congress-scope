Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, this country must keep its promises made 
to our servicemen and -women when they choose to serve our country by 
taking care of them when they return home as veterans. This Democratic 
Congress has been dedicated to making sure the needs of all America's 
veterans are fulfilled.

So far this year we've passed legislation providing the largest 
funding increase for veterans in the 77-year history of the VA. This 
funding will allow the VA to keep up with the growing number of 
veterans who need care, maintain its health care facilities, and treat 
veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who are suffering from 
PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.

We also voted to increase military pay by 3.5 percent, as well as 
special pay and bonuses to combat troops, putting an additional $7.3 
billion in military paychecks. Unfortunately, the Bush administration 
is now reneging on these enlistment bonuses to those severely wounded 
combat veterans.

Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress has made meeting the needs of 
the veterans and our military a top priority. This weekend, and every 
day, let us all remember the service of our Nation's veterans and 
commit ourselves to keeping this country's promises to them.
