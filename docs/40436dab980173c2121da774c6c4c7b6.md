# RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT
## `40436dab980173c2121da774c6c4c7b6`
`Mr. BACA â€” 12 July 2007`

---


Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a veteran who served in the 
101st and 82nd Airborne Division in support of H.R. 2956, the 
Responsible Redeployment From Iraq Act.

This war is a failure, and it's time to bring back our troops. We can 
no longer stay the course.

Mr. Speaker, the President's policy has been a complete failure. We 
have lost too many lives. There are too many wounded who will never 
have normal lives.

We're proud of our troops and the service they have provided to our 
country. But our troops are now trapped in the middle of a civil war 
that we cannot end.

This is something that the Iraqi people must do for themselves. Our 
military presence in Iraq is not making our country safer. Instead, the 
war has taken the lives of 3,610 soldiers.

In my district alone, we have lost 13 brave men and women, and when I 
see their faces and their families that have to deal with these 
individuals that have lost their lives, we're proud of them, but 
they've lost their lives, and the families who continue to suffer.

As a veteran, I say that this war was wrong because you could not 
convince me why we were there in the first place. The President sent 
our troops away without proper training or equipment or proof of 
weapons of mass destruction.



The President believes that Iraq is making our country safer. This is 
not true. It has put more of us in greater risk. Our military is 
stretched too thin. We are at risk of not being prepared for any future 
emergency.

The Iraq war has cost billions of dollars, $650 billion, $10 billion 
a month. The money could be used to defend homeland security, for 
police officers, for highway patrol officers, for fire fighters, for 
sheriffs, for education, for health care and our seniors.

A change in course in Iraq is overdue. We must bring our troops home 
now. It's time for a new direction. We must support this resolution.
