# PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2642,  SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008
## `8e337db5bbcc098ea619abb6d66799b4`
`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 15 May 2008`

Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I regretfully oppose this rule, not 
because I lack appreciation for the work of my colleagues in trying to 
craft a bill that would get consensus, but because we are right back to 
where we were in January of 2007. We made a commitment that we would 
take control of this Congress and would end the war. Now, with this 
bill, we are saying we will set a goal of 18 months from now. So what 
happens 18 months from now? We have to end this war by stopping the 
funding.

In this bill we are telling the Iraqis they are going to have to pay 
for the reconstruction. We are telling the Iraqis they are going to 
have to give a discount price for oil, so they are going to subsidize 
the war against their own country.

We are losing a lot in this war, not only hundreds of billions of 
dollars, not only the lives of our troops, not only the injuries, but 
we are also losing our sense of humanity and compassion. There have 
been over 1 million innocent Iraqis killed as a result of this war.

Vote against this rule.
