`Mr. HUNTER â€” 15 March 2007`

Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, I have given a fair amount of consideration to this 
bill, H.R. 1362. I have a couple of observations to share with you.

First, I am very proud of the work that the Armed Services Committee 
has done with respect to this bill to craft what I consider to be a 
better bill. I want to thank the chairman, my good friend from 
Missouri, Mr. Ike Skelton, for making sure that we participated in this 
markup and holding the markup of H.R. 1362.

I had serious concerns about the original bill as reported out of the 
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, including a number of 
provisions that, through amending title 10, U.S. Code, and other 
procurement regulations, would have had the effect of preventing the 
Department of Defense from serving warfighter needs in the most 
expeditious manner possible. That is an issue that I spoke to just a 
minute ago in my exchange with Mr. Waxman.

As my colleagues from the Armed Services Committee know, this 
committee has given a great deal of attention to matters pertaining to 
acquisition reform. This has been especially true during wartime as our 
committee has worked hard to ensure that the brave men and women 
serving our country receive what they need when they need it as they 
deploy to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of operation.

At the same time, we have been vigorous advocates for competition and 
cost control measures. I firmly believe that the Armed Services 
Committee is best suited to properly balance the need for improving 
accountability in defense contracting while at the same time ensuring 
that the Department of Defense can carry out its duties to the 
warfighter. I am pleased that the chairman agreed to hold an Armed 
Services Committee markup of this bill. In continuing its rich 
tradition of deliberation and robust oversight of matters within its 
jurisdiction, the committee produced a higher quality piece of 
legislation.

I supported Chairman Skelton's mark because I believe the mark 
remedied the most serious deficiencies of the base bill and was truly a 
bipartisan measure. The Armed Services Committee mark encouraged 
competition and cost controls while protecting procurement 
flexibilities important to the national interest.

Secondly, it provided Congress with additional tools for oversight 
and reinforced standards of integrity widely held by the dedicated men 
and women of the defense acquisition workforce.

But, unfortunately, we are not here today to vote for the Armed 
Services Committee mark. We are not even here to vote for the Committee 
on Oversight Government Reform mark, which leads me to my second set of 
observations.

We are here today to vote for a piece of legislation that was not 
voted out of any committee. Those who would say this bill received 
unanimous support in two committees would not be telling it as it is. 
The full truth is that the Speaker wanted to put a rush on this bill so 
she could say Congress did something about contract reform. It was 
introduced late one night, and in 24 hours it was being voted out of 
committee. In two more business days a markup was scheduled in the 
Committee on Armed Services. Late that night, additional text was added 
that changed the bill yet again, and I think in a potentially dangerous 
way.

But no member of Oversight and Government Reform or Armed Services 
got to vote on those changes. Instead, the language simply appeared out 
of nowhere and the rule for H.R. 1362 let the new bill move to the 
floor.

What would the new language do? It is hard to say because the text is 
subject to broad interpretation, which is precisely what concerns me. 
One thing can safely be said. It is ironic that the original bill would 
have required agencies to hire thousands of additional personnel, but 
at the same time this new language would presume those personnel are 
dishonest and would attempt to restrict their decisionmaking ability or 
their ability to seek further employment.

I am all for accountability and performance in Federal contracting. I 
am likewise for accountability and performance in the legislative 
branch. Frankly, I am disappointed in the final product of this bill, 
and I am referring to the parts that were put in after we marked up our 
portion of the bill.

Mr. Chairman, let me go right back to Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Waxman and 
their assertion that somehow we are leaving a period of no oversight, 
and they have brought now oversight to the warfighting process and 
accountability for the contracts that are let pursuant to this war 
against terror. That is absolutely not the truth.

As anybody knows when you are fighting a war, you need to move 
quickly. I use once again the example of the jammers that we got out 
the door under a new waiver strategy where you waive all acquisition 
regulations. You go in and build something that the troops need 
immediately on the battlefield. You don't give a 6-month appeal to the 
folks that lose the competition. You don't give small business set-
asides because there is one thing you don't have, you don't have time.

When we have troops that are experiencing bombs on the battlefield 
that are detonated remotely, you have to move quickly to get the 
jammers that will jam that electronic device. When you have new 
explosives that are penetrating your Humvees, you have to get steel on 
the sides of those Humvees quickly.



When you are moving a military force down the road and you have to 
get fuel to that force, whether it is in movement or in base, you have 
to move quickly. You cannot have 6-month appeal periods. You cannot 
have buyers'


forums that take months to set up. You have to move quickly.

Now, when you have time, you want to absolutely have competition, and 
I can just tell my colleagues that that is always in my interest to 
have competition, get the best buy for the buck, and we have had a 
number of forums incidentally. We introduced the Challenge Program 
where any company that could come in and say, I could make a better 
tire for the Humvee than the incumbent, or I can make a better 
windshield or a better engine, that guy or lady has got the right to go 
in and challenge the incumbent company that has the present contract 
and show how they can do it cheaper or make something that has better 
warfighting capability. We introduced that legislation. That is called 
the Challenge Legislation.

But let us not mix that up with this idea that somehow you can have 
competition on every single aspect of the battlefield, and when you 
need a new jammer to stop roadside bombs, you go out and you start a 
month-long search, and then you have a 6-month competition, and then 
after the award you have a 6-month appeal, and by that time you are 
ready for the next war. You are not even relevant to the situation that 
is hurting your young men and women on the battlefield right now.

So there is some good substance in this bill, and I like it, but 
there is a lot of rhetoric. There is a lot of worthless, political 
rhetoric that preceded this bill, and I hope that the American people 
will not be snagged by that one. There are times that you have to move 
quickly.

I am reminded of one contractor that came back. One of the 
contractors who was not one of the 389 who has been killed in this war, 
and he showed me a picture of a crater, of a mortar crater. He said, 
That is where I was standing 5 minutes before that mortar landed. He 
said, I do not care how much you award this contract for, I am not 
going back to that dangerous AO.

Let me tell you, there are a lot of people who do go back time and 
time again. They are good Americans. They are honest Americans, and 
they are the same folks carrying out the contracting and administering 
the support of our Armed Forces who were there 6 months ago. The idea 
that somehow they have been crooked up to now, that now they are going 
to be straightened out by Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Waxman is absolutely 
outrageous.

So having said those gentle words, I look forward to the continued 
discussion. Mr. Waxman has taken the floor. I would be happy to yield 
to Mr. Waxman if he has got a rejoinder.
