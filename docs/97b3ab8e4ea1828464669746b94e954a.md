Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that on page 16 of the supplemental 
appropriations bill, H.R. 4899, under the heading ''Afghanistan 
Security Forces Fund'' and on page 17 under the heading ''Iraq Security 
Forces Fund,'' which appropriate funds for training, equipment, and 
other assistance for these foreign security forces, there is language 
that makes these funds available ''notwithstanding any other provision 
of law.'' I would ask my friend, the chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee and of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, whether I am 
correct that this ''notwithstanding'' language is not intended to apply 
to the


''Leahy'' vetting procedures which are designed to ensure that foreign 
security forces that receive U.S. assistance have not been credibly 
alleged to have committed violations of human rights.
