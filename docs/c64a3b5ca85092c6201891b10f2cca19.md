Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, at the same time we are honoring these 
soldiers, we cannot forget their families, because they have sacrificed 
as well.

I have known 29 soldiers who have been killed in the Afghanistan and 
Iraq wars. At one of these funerals that I attended, I met a young 
soldier who was escorting a body to my district, and he gave me this 
poem that I will always carry with me and that I will never forget. 
These are the people whose birthday we are celebrating today.



It is entitled, ''Soldier.''

''I was that which others did not want to be.

''I went where others feared to go and did what others failed to do.

''I asked nothing from those who gave nothing, and reluctantly 
accepted the thought of eternal loneliness should I fail.

''I have seen the face of terror, felt the stinging cold of fear, and 
enjoyed the sweet taste of a moment's love.

''I have cried, pained, and hoped; but most of all, I have lived 
times others would say were best forgotten.

''At least someday I will be able to say that I was proud of what I 
was, a soldier.''

This is their birthday, the United States Army.
