Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
2179, the Traumatic Brain Injury Centers Act.

I introduced this bill because traumatic brain injury, or TBI, has 
become the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and it 
needs our Nation's full attention.

While new forms of military technology are routinely saving soldiers' 
lives from deadly explosive attacks, these survivors often return home 
suffering from TBI. Veterans suffering from TBI may have trouble 
relearning simple skills or might be left permanently unable to perform 
daily functions.

H.R. 2179 would help veterans and their families cope with TBI by 
creating five traumatic brain injury centers. These centers would 
conduct TBI research, develop improved models for TBI care, and provide 
education and training on TBI for VA staff. While the VA has built an 
impressive medical system that includes polytrauma centers, H.R. 2179 
would ensure that the VA system includes centers solely focussed on 
TBI. These centers will be the focal point for research and education 
dealing with this injury.

As American servicemembers return home, many of them suffering from 
TBI, we owe them nothing less than the highest quality care this Nation 
can provide.
