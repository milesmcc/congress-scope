`Mr. LEWIS of California â€” 19 April 2007`

---


Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

In doing so, I rise to offer a very simple, straightforward motion to 
instruct conferees on the fiscal year 2007 emergency supplemental 
appropriations bill.

The motion to instruct simply insists that House conferees support 
the previously adopted House position with regard to a timetable for 
the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. This motion, which I will oppose, 
puts Members on record as either fully supporting our troops or 
agreeing to a surrender date in Iraq. It is that simple.

It is no secret that many Members of the House, both Republicans and 
Democrats, have strong reservations about the manner in which this 
legislation undermines the authority of the President, our commander in 
chief. Members are also rightly concerned about how this legislation 
places military decisions in the hands of politicians rather than the 
military commanders in the field.

This legislation ought to focus on our troops. It ought to focus on 
providing those in harm's way with the resources they need to complete 
their mission successfully. It ought to respect, not micromanage, our 
combatant commanders in whom we place the ultimate responsibility for 
prosecuting military actions.

Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress are many things. We are elected to 
represent the interests of our constituents from our congressional 
districts. However, as presently written, this legislation makes the 
dangerous assumption that Congress also has an on-the-ground role in 
prosecuting the war in Iraq.

In closing, let me remind my colleagues of this: We are not generals. 
We are not the Secretary of State. And we are most certainly not the 
commander in chief.

The vote on this motion to instruct will signal whether Members of 
the


House are willing to provide our men and women in uniform with our 
unqualified support or whether Members will fully embrace a timetable 
for withdrawal and surrender.

I urge a ''no'' vote on this motion to instruct.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
