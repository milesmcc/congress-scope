Mr. BYRD. Those of us who disagreed with the plan to go into Iraq in 
the beginning--and now who disagree with the request that we put more 
troops into Iraq--we are not talking about the Normandy beach. That was 
an entirely different matter.


What are we fighting for over here in Iraq? Why are the American 
people sending their boys and girls into Iraq, a country that has not 
attacked us? Why are we sending our boys and girls to have their blood 
spilled in that faraway country? For what? For what are we spending 
these billions of dollars?

I cannot understand it. I say that most respectfully to the 
distinguished Senator, who is my friend.
