Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of a 
fallen American hero, Marine Sergeant Jeremy McQueary of Columbus, 
Indiana.

Sgt. McQueary served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he 
gave his life in service to a grateful nation on Thursday, February 
18th while serving with the 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion, 2nd Marine 
Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force in Helmand Province, 
Afghanistan.

Sgt. McQueary enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in January 
2002 after graduating from Columbus East High School. According to his 
mother, Jeremy always had an interest in becoming a Marine and 
continuing the proud tradition of service in his family by donning the 
uniform of our nation.

Though Sgt. McQueary did not speak often of his experiences overseas, 
his dedication and bravery were quite evident by his actions and 
decorations. In June of 2008, he survived a roadside bombing attack and 
volunteered to continue serving in Iraq. His awards include a Combat 
Action Ribbon and Purple Heart, among others.

Sgt. McQueary was a compassionate man who cared especially for 
children. A father himself, Sgt. McQueary expressed a desire to work 
with children in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Our condolences go out to Jeremy's wife Rae and young son Hadley, as 
well as his mother and stepfather, Deborah and David Kleinschmidt, and 
sister Rebecca.

We will never be able to pay the debt of honor owed to Sergeant 
Jeremy McQueary and his family. Heroes like him are our nation's most 
cherished citizens without whom freedom and democracy would not be 
possible. His passing is a profound loss for his family, this community 
and this nation.
