`Mr. TESTER â€” 30 July 2008`

Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to begin by noting that, again, it 
is fire season in Montana.

Right now, major wildfires are threatening homes in a small town 
called Red Lodge. The Cascade fire has been burning and has burned 
about 6,000 acres. It is burning uncomfortably close to the Red Lodge 
Mountain ski area.

The hot, dry weather forecast over the next week means there are 
likely to be more fires and more acres of rangeland and forest lost.

Fire season in Montana officially runs from August until the first 
snow in fall. So, once again, we are off to an early start.

Wildfires are becoming a fact of the West. We accept it. We deal with 
it.

The good news is Montana is blessed with outstanding firefighters 
from the U.S. Forest Service, Tribal Nations, and the State Department 
of Natural Resources, as well as first responders from local volunteer 
and paid fire departments.

When they need reinforcements, they turn to the Montana National 
Guard. Last year, more than 200 guardsmen were mobilized to help fight 
wildfires in Montana. While no guardsmen have been mobilized yet this 
year, it will happen at some point--just as they are mobilized every 
year to protect people and homes, dig out fire lines, smother embers, 
and provide all manner of hands-on support to this team effort.

There are not too many jobs in this country where the work is as 
varied as service in our National Guard. This summer we can expect that 
hundreds of National Guardsmen in Montana and throughout the West will 
be mobilized to help fight wildfires. It has already happened in 
California, where the Governor called up 200 Guardsmen.

This is a vital role in our Nation's homeland security.

And just as the Guard answers the call for homeland security 
missions, they answer the bell when it comes to national security.

In 2004 and 2005, more than 1,500 of my State's National Guard 
deployed to Iraq. They did yeoman's work over there, and we can all be 
very proud of their service and grateful for it as well. Today, there 
are nearly 23,000 National Guardsmen serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Another 3,000 Guardsmen from all over the country work hard to 
protect our southern border, helping the Border Patrol get a better 
handle on securing that border. Four hundred Montana Guardsmen were a 
proud part of that important effort earlier this year.

So as the National Guard in Montana prepares for the inevitable 
mobilization fight against wildfires here at home, I think it is 
appropriate we stop to thank the 3,500-strong members of our Montana 
National Guard for what they do both abroad and here at home.

As wildfires continue to threaten Montana's countryside and our 
communities, I wish to pay tribute to all the brave men and women who 
put it on the line to fight our fires.


















 Energy


Mr. President, I wish to comment on the energy debate we have been 
having in the Senate. Every Tuesday morning, for 2/1/2/ hours, I get to 
preside over this great body, and I get to hear folks from both sides 
of the aisle talk about issues of importance.


The energy debate has been particularly intriguing because I have 
seen folks on the other side of the aisle hold up signs that talk about 
drilling more and using less.

They are quick to support oil production. But on the other hand, they 
will not support alternative energies or conservation methods. They 
talk about drilling more as if it is going to change the price of 
gasoline tomorrow.

The fact is, the United States has less than 3 percent of the world's 
reserves of oil. We use 25 percent of the supply. As far as drilling 
goes, we are drilling now like there is no tomorrow. In fact, in 
Montana, you would be hard-pressed to find a drilling rig if you wanted 
to punch a hole.

In Montana, we have offered over 3 million acres of leasing since 
2000. We have increased our oil production two and a half-fold. We have 
drilled 4,870 wells in the last 5 years. Yet we continually see the 
price of oil go up and up and up. Why? Well, a lot of it has to do with 
the fact that the major oil companies last year made hundreds of 
billions of dollars off the consumers' back.

What can we do? What can we do to help bring the price of oil down? 
Sure, we are going to continue to drill, and I support that effort. But 
we need additions to our energy portfolio. If we continue to rely on 
oil as our chief supplier of energy, we are going to be continuing to 
be beholden to Saudi Arabia and OPEC forever. That ought not be the 
direction we go.

My good friend, my comrade, Senator Baucus, put forth a tax extenders 
bill earlier today. Yesterday, we had a chance to vote on one from the 
House. They were both defeated. They were not allowed to move forward. 
There was a majority, but there was not 60 votes.

What was in that tax extenders bill? One of the things that was in it 
was a renewable energy tax credit extension, a continuation that would 
put more energy in the marketplace.

As shown on this chart, we can see what happens when we have the wind 
energy tax credit. The yellow bars indicate that. The orange bars 
indicate when it does not happen. If we have the wind energy tax 
credit, wind energy production goes up, and there is more


energy in the marketplace. When we don't, it does not.

Because of the vote that was taken earlier today, you will see a 
decrease in wind energy production--a big mistake for this country, not 
very visionary.

Because of the vote that took place earlier today, we not only will 
see wind energy grind to a halt, we will see geothermal--which we have 
a tremendous opportunity for throughout the country, particularly in 
Montana--we will see biomass, landfill gas--we have an electrical 
cooperative in northwestern Montana, Flathead Electric Cooperative, 
that is talking about capturing methane gas off the landfill to produce 
energy, getting something from nothing--we will not see any of that 
stuff go on because of the defeat of the tax extenders bill.

In that tax extenders bill, there were also long-term extensions of 
tax credits for solar energy and fuel cells. Solar energy: getting our 
energy from the Sun to help replace some of that oil from the Middle 
East--not going to happen. Folks talk about corn ethanol and how they 
don't like it. I am not one of them. But I do think we need to get the 
second generation of ethanol production, cellulosic ethanol. There was 
a credit for property in that tax extenders bill that was not agreed to 
earlier today. That will not happen; a biodiesel tax credit. I have 
talked about a camelina provision in the farm bill for biodiesel, and 
there are other opportunities in all sorts of oilseeds out there. The 
biodiesel tax credit does not happen because we did not pass that bill 
Senator Baucus offered earlier today.

Carbon capture and storage technology to make our coal burn cleaner. 
In Montana, we are the ''Saudi Arabia'' of coal. We have an incredible 
opportunity. But without good technology to capture carbon and store 
it, we will never be all we can be. It would make us more energy 
independent.

Talk about producing more here at home: Drilling is part of the 
equation. But an even bigger part of the equation could have been to 
pass that tax extenders bill earlier today.

Let's talk about using less.

In that tax extenders bill, there were energy efficiency tax credits 
to help make our homes more energy efficient. It is not going to 
happen. There was a credit to reduce idling for truckers--that we all 
see happen--to save transportation fuel. It is not going to happen.

You want to talk about using less? There was a bicycling tax credit 
for those folks who want to ride their bicycle to work rather than to 
drive. It will not happen.

There were incentives for geothermal heat pumps in our homes that use 
less energy with more consistency. It is not going to happen.

There were energy conservation bonds for States and local school 
districts. The list goes on and on and on.

I ask myself: Why? Why does it have to be this way? Why aren't we 
looking to the future? Why are we not talking about more than drilling? 
The fact is, we are drilling. We are drilling an incredible amount of 
land in this country. It needs to be a bridge. But it needs to be a 
bridge to somewhere this time. If we put forth the renewable energy 
components that are in the tax extenders bill, we will have a future. 
We will have a future of affordable energy.


I ask my comrades to pass that tax extenders bill. It is incredibly 
important. It is not just because of energy that it is important.















Secure Rural Schools


Finally, I wish to talk about the security of rural schools. These 
are payments to Montana's rural communities and forested counties that 
have an incredible amount of public lands.

The Secure Rural Schools dollars are important not only for the 
school but also for our roads and our rural counties. Montana is rich 
in public lands. Consequently, it puts more pressure on property taxes 
of private property in those counties. With the Secure Rural Schools 
money, it gives those rural and forested counties the opportunity to 
meet the needs of the kids in these rural districts and to meet the 
needs of the transportation industry in those rural districts. We all 
know that less money for rural schools means lower teacher pay, bigger 
classroom size, fewer activities, and students start to fall behind.

County road workers right now are being laid off. I spoke with the 
head of the Montana Association of Counties. He said to the counties: 
Take your budgets and utilize them as if this money is not going to 
happen because it is not until we pass the tax extenders programs.

We had the opportunity in this body today and yesterday to pass a 
good bill that meets the needs of America's families, small businesses, 
and the economy. It was not passed. There are all sorts of excuses for 
it, but they are simply that: excuses. We need to move forward with 
some proactive thinking in this body. I hope the next time this bill 
hits this floor, it is passed and passed by a large margin.

I thank the Chair.

I yield the floor.
