Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize, congratulate 
and welcome home the remaining Soldiers of the 40th Expeditionary 
Signal Battalion, part of the 11th Signal Brigade, to Fort Huachuca, 
Arizona.

The battalion's 600 Soldiers began their deployment in December 2007. 
The men and women of the 40th Signal Battalion supported combat 
operations throughout the Middle East as part of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom by providing secure communications and command-and-control 
networks for both U.S. war fighters and coalition partners. This was 
the third time the unit was called to war since the conflicts in Iraq 
and Afghanistan began.

This week the remainder of the 40th Signal Battalion returned home to 
a proud and grateful nation. They join other Soldiers from 11th Signal 
Brigade who returned to Fort Huachuca at the end of December from a 
similar mission in the Middle East. Together, the 40th Battalion and 
the 11th Brigade Soldiers courageous and heroically completed their 
critical mission. They represent the best of Southern Arizona and our 
Army. As with all of our brave men and women, we are proud and 
appreciate their service to our nation.
