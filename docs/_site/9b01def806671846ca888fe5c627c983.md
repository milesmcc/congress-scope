Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Timothy 
Shriver, my cousin, for his stewardship in leading the world's most 
formative human rights organization. Tim is the Chairman of the Board 
of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Special Olympics. 
In this capacity, Tim serves 3.1 million Special Olympics athletes and 
their families in 175 countries. His work for those with disabilities 
is simply unmatched.

After taking the helm at Special Olympics in 1996, Cousin Tim 
launched the organization's most ambitious growth agenda, leading to 
the recruitment of more than 2 million new athletes around the world. 
He has worked with the leaders of China to initiate a thriving Special 
Olympics Program in their country, highlighted by their hosting the 
2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Shanghai. He has also 
worked with world leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, George 
Bush, Bertie Ahern, Rafiq Hariri, Thabo Weld, Julius Nyerere, Hosni 
Mubarak and Shimon Peres to advance the growth of the Special Olympics 
mission and vision while challenging nations to adopt more supportive 
and just policies. He has spearheaded programs in developing or war-
torn countries such as Afghanistan, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Iraq.

Tim has also created exciting new Special Olympics initiatives in 
athlete leadership, cross-cultural research, health, education and 
family support. Among them, Special Olympics Healthy Athletes has 
become the world's largest public health screening and education 
program for people with intellectual disabilities, and Special Olympics 
Get Into It, together with Unified Sports, promotes inclusion and 
acceptance around the world.

In addition, he has worked to garner more legislative attention and 
government support for issues of concern to the Special Olympics 
community, testifying before the U.S. Congress on numerous occasions.

As part of his passion for promoting the gifts of the forgotten, Tim 
has harnessed the power of Hollywood to share the stories of 
inspiration and change, co-producing DreamWorks Studios' 1997 release, 
''Amistad,'' and Disney. Studios' 2000 release, ''The Loretta Claiborne 
Story.'' He is Executive Producer of ''The Ringer,'' a Family Brothers' 
film, and also has produced or co-produced shows for ABC, TNT and NBC 
networks, and made broadcast appearances on ''The Today Show,'' CNN, 
MTV and Nickelodeon's ''World of Difference.''

Before joining Special Olympics, Tim was and remains a leading 
educator focusing on the social and emotional factors in learning. He 
has worked in substance abuse prevention, violence, dropout prevention 
and teen pregnancy prevention. He created the New Haven Public Schools' 
Social Development Project, now considered the leading school-based 
prevention effort in the United States, and co-founded the 
Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL), the 
leading research organization in the United States in the field of 
social and emotional learning. Tim currently chairs CASEL.

Tim earned his undergraduate degree from Yale University, a Master's 
degree in Religion and Religious Education from Catholic University, 
and a Doctorate in Education from the University of Connecticut. He is 
the recipient of numerous honors, including honorary degrees from 
Loyola University, New England College and Albertus Magnus College; the 
Medal of the City of Athens, Greece; the Order de Manuel Amador 
Guerrera of the Republic of Panama; the 1995 Connecticut Citizen of the 
Year; the Surgeon General's Medallion; and the 2007 Lions Humanitarian 
Award. He has authored articles in many leading publications including 
''The New York Times,'' ''The Washington Post'' and ''Commonweal.''

Tim has helped transform Special Olympics into a movement that 
focuses on respect, acceptance and inclusion for individuals with 
intellectual disabilities in all corners of the globe. I wish Tim all 
the best as he continues his important work on behalf of those with 
disabilities. He will continue to carry my own admiration, and that of 
all who have had the privilege to work with him.
