Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a real American 
hero, United States Marine Cpl. Larry A. Draughn Jr. of Dayton, Ohio. 
On May 30th, 2009, while out on patrol in Afghanistan, Cpl. Draught 
lost both legs and nearly lost his life during an IED explosion. I 
would like to thank him for his service to his country and place this 
poem, penned in honor of him by Albert Carey Caswell, in the 
Congressional Record.
