Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding.

Madam Speaker, I think this is a sad day for our country, because we 
put into place several years ago what we called a bridge fund. I call 
it the ammo, the armor, the equipment fund. That was a fund that we 
added to the Defense bill to carry our troops over during the winter 
months before that spring supplemental, before that extra funding came 
about in the springtime of the next year.

That is important for them, and that gave them a certain confidence 
level that they were going to be funded without having to take money 
out of the cash register for the next year, have to delay training 
exercises, have to delay the equipping of forces back here in the 
United States.

And you know something? We had a bill that was ready to go here. The 
Defense appropriations bill is something that clearly would sail 
through, the President would sign it, and there was no risk in this 
bill that would fund our operations and our warfighting in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

The Democrat leadership now has injected risk, because you have 
hooked it up with a bill that the President said he is going to veto. 
That injects risk into this very, very difficult operation.

So what do we have with our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our 
marines in Afghanistan and Iraq? We have got the uncertainties of war, 
the dangers of war. We have got the uncertainties that attend their 
families back here in the United States. And now the Democrat 
leadership has injected another uncertainty, an uncertainty that they 
will be funded fully in these difficult months.



So you took away this bridge fund, what I call the ammo, the armor, 
the equipment fund, and the answer you have given us is, well, if the 
President caves, then the troops will get the money. Holding our 
troops, our forces, hostage during a time of war is something that this 
body has never done.

I would hope that the Democrat leadership would make an about-face on 
this. I would hope you would adopt the great position of Democrat 
Senator Henry ''Scoop'' Jackson, who said, ''In time of war, the best 
politics is no politics.''
