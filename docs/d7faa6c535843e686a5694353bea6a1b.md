Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate SGT Keith 
Allen Kline, born and raised in Oak Harbor, Ohio, and whose life was 
tragically cut short when he died in service in Iraq. He was mortally 
wounded while on patrol in Baghdad on July 5, 2007. Over the weekend 
his community will honor his memory and comfort his family, and 
Sergeant Kline will be laid to rest in Oak Harbor's Union Cemetery on 
Monday, July 16, 2007.
