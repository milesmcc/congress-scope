Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Senator Carte 
P. Goodwin of West Virginia for his service. When he was sworn into 
office in July, Senator Goodwin assumed the seat previously held by the 
Chamber's longest serving and one of the most distinguished Senators in 
our history--Senator Robert C. Byrd, who passed away on June 28.

Before arriving in the Senate, Senator Goodwin already had an 
impressive political career. As chief counsel to West Virginia Governor 
Joe Manchin, Carte Goodwin led the effort to reform mine safety rules 
in the wake of the Sago and Aracoma coal mine disasters that killed 14 
coal miners. He also served as the chairman of the West Virginia School 
Building Authority.

Senator Goodwin serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which 
I chair. As a committee member, Senator Goodwin has helped pass the 
National Defense Authorization Act out of committee. He has also 
contributed to hearings overseeing the status of conflicts in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

As Senator Goodwin's time in the Senate draws to a close, I thank him 
for his service to our country, and I wish him and his family the very 
best.
