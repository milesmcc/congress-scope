Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding, and 
let me thank him for bringing this amendment to the floor.

All this amendment says is that we are going to reduce the level of 
spending in this bill to last year's level. It's overdoing. We are not 
whacking away


at everything, and I think that the gentleman has a very good point. I 
do that because excessive spending makes it more difficult for us to 
balance the Federal budget.



It takes money away from our children and our grandchildren. An 
across-the-board cut is another way of being fair and simple, but it 
gets us back to last year's level.

Now, the spending in these appropriations bills is one issue. But 
let's make sure we review the bidding on what's happened here thus far 
this year. In February, when the supplemental spending bill came 
through, the CR to fund the government for this year came through here, 
it had $6 billion of spending over and above the President's level.

And then we had the budget come through with an additional $20 
billion worth of domestic discretionary spending included in it.

And then just last month we had the supplemental spending bill for 
Iraq and Katrina that had an additional $17 billion over and above what 
the President has asked for.

If you look at all of that, $1.1 billion in the Energy and Water 
Appropriations Bill that's already passed, another $1.9 billion in this 
bill, you begin to add all this up, and it's real money. And at some 
point, somebody has to pay for it. And that's the real crux of the 
issue here.

Most of us came here to make sure that we had a government that was 
affordable, so that we could keep the American Dream alive for our kids 
and theirs. And the more that we spend and the more that we mortgage 
their future, the harder it is for them to have the same chances in 
life that many of us have had.

And if the spending that we've talked about isn't bad enough, if you 
look at the budget that my friends across the aisle passed last spring, 
there's no entitlement reform. My colleague, the chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, will soon rise and talk about the 
$4 billion or $4 trillion worth of debt that's accumulated over the 
last 6 years.

We know that we have to deal with entitlements. I'm trying to help 
you give your speech, Mr. Obey. We have to deal with entitlements. Over 
the course of the 12 years that Republicans ran the House, we dealt 
with entitlements some three times, not as often as we should have, not 
as aggressively as we should have.

But we have made promises to ourselves, those of us who are baby 
boomers, promises that our kids and our grandkids can't afford. And at 
some point we, as responsible stewards of our government, need to grab 
a hold of these entitlements and begin to change them.

Several years ago we made a modest effort, some $40 billion in 
entitlement reductions over 5 years, a step in the right direction. But 
to bring a budget out here that says we're not going to deal with 
entitlements for the next 5 years, I think, is totally irresponsible. 
And so if we're serious about making sure that our kids and their kids 
have a real chance at the American Dream, we've got to say no.

The American people sent us here to make decisions about how to best 
spend their money. And if we just keep adding more money, guess what? 
We never have to make a decision. That's not what the American people 
expect of us. They expect of us to have a government that's affordable, 
that's accountable, and something that they can afford in their family 
budget.
