Mr. BRADY of Texas. I yield myself 30 seconds.

I would remind people the Democratic Congress handed President Obama 
a trillion dollar deficit, eight times larger than Republicans when we 
held this Congress. The stimulus bill alone was larger than the Iraq 
and Afghanistan wars. And, unfortunately, only 6 percent of Americans 
feel the stimulus has helped create jobs in America. What a terrible 
waste.

With that, I would yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. Moran).
