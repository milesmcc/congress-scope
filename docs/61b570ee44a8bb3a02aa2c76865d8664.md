`Mr. COCHRAN â€” 21 January 2009`

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of 
Senator Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of State. Her service as the 
Senator from New York for the past 8 years has been proof of her 
impressive ability to effectively and thoughtfully contribute to the 
governance of our Nation. I have enjoyed working with her in the 
Senate, and I look forward to continuing that relationship in her role 
as Secretary of State.

Our Nation is confronted with serious global challenges, and it is 
imperative that we work to develop comprehensive strategies and expand 
our diplomatic efforts in search of peace. President Obama has a 
tremendous task before him. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
stabilizing the Middle East, securing nuclear material from terrorists 
are all critical to our own national security. Senator Clinton's 
experience as First Lady of the United States, her record in the 
Senate, and her commitment to the people of this Nation have 
demonstrated her capabilities to lead our Nation's foreign policy and 
diplomatic agenda.

I urge the Senate to approve her nomination. I thank the Senator, and 
I yield the floor.
