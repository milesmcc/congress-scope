# U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,

Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the conference report on 
the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act.

For more than 3 years, when the President came to Congress to ask for 
funding for Iraq, the Republican leadership's only question was, ''How 
much?''

When the President wanted to extend the tours of duty for troops 
already deployed and imposed stop-loss orders, the Republican 
leadership's only question was, ''How soon?''

And when the President decided to send more troops to Iraq in one of 
the failed surges, the Republicans only asked, ''How many?''

Madam Speaker, today we end the era of Congressional fealty to the 
President's failed policies in Iraq.

Today we stop writing blank checks for this war.

We vote today for a new direction in Iraq.

My constituents know that we can't win this war militarily. They know 
that it's time to start bringing our troops home.

It's time for the President to stop the rhetoric and work with us to 
end this war.

Support the troops. Bring them home.
