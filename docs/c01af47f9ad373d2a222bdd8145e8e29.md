Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just want to say to the Senator from 
Hawaii, through the Chair, how much I respect him. I understand why he 
has to take this approach on this particular attempt to offer this 
amendment. The fact is, this great Senator, this war hero, has 
supported us on this amendment in other contexts. He is in agreement 
with us.

He has a responsibility on this bill that I respect. But what greater 
statement that we are on the right track in terms of wanting to have a 
reasonable withdrawal from Iraq than the fact that this great Senator 
has been supportive. So I thank him. Of course, I hope people will vote 
with me on this amendment, but I completely understand his reason for 
taking this approach on this particular bill.

I reserve the remainder of my time.
