# WAR SUPPLEMENTAL IS BAD POLITICS, BAD POLICY

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. The gentleman is exactly right. I think the point was 
made, this is a young government. This is a young government that is 
basically about 8 months old. Basically they are learning how to govern 
because they have been an oppressed people for so long.

I think about our Nation, we are going to celebrate over 230 years of 
history of this country, this Republic. We are still learning how to 
govern in many ways. I think talking about drop-dead dates, wouldn't it 
be nice if we had a drop-dead date to go to a balanced budget in this 
Congress?

The gentleman talked about the splitting of oil reserves, and I think 
some of the positive things are there has been a tentative agreement 
reached within some of the Iraqi leadership, and they are going to 
hopefully bring that to a vote here fairly quickly. Prime Minister 
Maliki is making it very clear that there is no one that is a sacred 
cow in this war. If there are bad people out there, no matter what 
their affiliation is, that they have permission to go and do that.



And the list goes on and on of the positives. Yes, we still have 
fatalities; yes, we still have people being killed in that country. But 
we have never, I don't know of a war we have fought that there weren't 
those costs.
