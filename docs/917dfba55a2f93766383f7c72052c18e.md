Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I rise in support of H.R. 5975, designating the post office in 
Waterville, New York, as the Corporal John P. Sigsbee Post Office.

In October 2005, Corporal Sigsbee joined the 101st Airborne Division 
32nd Cavalry Unit, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, famously known as 
the home of the Screaming Eagles. After being deployed to Iraq, he was 
injured by a roadside bomb in July 2006. For his action, he was honored 
with the Purple Heart. After recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center, 
he insisted on returning to Iraq. Steve English, one of Corporal 
Sigsbee's high school teachers, said, ''John was doing something he 
knew was important. After being injured, he could have chosen to be 
assigned anywhere. He chose Iraq.'' English noted that it was indeed 
Corporal Sigsbee's commitment to his fellow soldiers that drove him to 
return to Iraq.

Sadly, during his second deployment, Corporal Sigsbee was killed in 
action on January 16, 2008, along with two other American soldiers when 
they came under small arms fire and grenade attack in Balad. He was 
posthumously honored with a bronze star for his service and a promotion 
to the rank of corporal.

Corporal John Patrick Sigsbee's life and tragic death have served as 
a rallying point for his community of Waterville, New York. By naming 
the new post office in his hometown after this brave young American, we 
will establish not only a permanent monument for this fallen soldier, 
but a permanent reminder of his example.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
