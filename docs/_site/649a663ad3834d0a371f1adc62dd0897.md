Mr. NYE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our troops and our 
military families and in support of a provision in the manager's 
amendment to the Defense appropriations bill which will help our 
military families.

Mr. Speaker, injured military personnel and veterans, including many 
who live in my district, often have to travel far from home to receive 
specialized medical treatment, taking them away from their families 
during a difficult time. The Fisher House Foundation is a public-
private partnership which provides housing to allow military family 
members to be close to their loved ones during hospitalizations or 
medical treatment. Each year the Fisher House program serves about 
10,000 families at no charge, enabling them to focus on their husbands 
and wives, parents, sons and daughters.

This amendment includes a provision which I offered to give more 
support to the Fisher House Foundation to provide housing to more 
military families. Mr. Speaker, the troops I worked with in Iraq and 
Afghanistan were willing to put their lives on the line for our 
country, and we should do everything in our power to ease the burden on 
our wounded warriors and their families. I hope my colleagues will join 
me in supporting this valuable program and in supporting our military 
families.
