Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, our country faces great challenges: energy 
independence, global warming, economic competitiveness, health care, 
and widening income inequality. But when I visit with people in Maine, 
the first issue they bring up is Iraq.

We cannot address our other pressing issues unless we solve our most 
urgent problem: Iraq. We cannot make many needed investments in our 
future until we put our involvement in Iraq in the past. The war in 
Iraq is straining our military and compromising our ability to address 
vital priorities like global terrorism and nuclear proliferation. It is 
diverting attention from dealing with Iran, North Korea, and 
Afghanistan. Since the President will not, Congress must lead to force 
Iraqis to take responsibility for their own security by directing an 
orderly redeployment of troops and promoting a political solution in 
Iraq with a focus on transition to Iraqi control.

Recent experience shows that the U.S. must impose deadlines with 
consequences so that Iraqi leaders will be compelled to take 
responsibility. An unending U.S. military presence in Iraq creates a 
climate of dependency that undermines the goal of having the Iraqi 
Government control internal security.

There is a growing consensus that only a political solution, not a 
military one, will address the sectarian conflict in Iraq. Yet 
President Bush has rejected the wisdom of military commanders, the Iraq 
Study Group, and the voters by choosing to send more troops into the 
crossfire of a sectarian civil war. If the President won't provide an 
exit strategy, Congress must take the lead in ending the war.

To achieve this goal, I have cosponsored H.R. 645, a bill introduced 
by Representatives David Price and Brad Miller. The bill would, by 
December 31, 2007, terminate the authorization for military operations 
in Iraq that passed, over my objection, in 2002.

The original mission Congress authorized, eliminating weapons of mass 
destruction and ousting Saddam Hussein, is no longer operative. If the 
President wants U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the end of this year, he 
should justify his plans and seek new approval from Congress. I am 
confident that the new Congress will not give the President a blank 
check, as the congressional majority wrongly did in 2002.

H.R. 645 also requires the President to submit a plan and timetable 
for phasing out troop deployments by December 31, 2007. It declares 
that U.S. policy is to withdraw forces in order to transfer 
responsibility to Iraqis; prohibits funding for permanent U.S. bases; 
authorizes employment, democracy, and governance programs; and creates 
a special envoy for Iraq regional security.

America's servicemen and -women in Iraq have served with skill, 
determination, and courage. We owe them and their families our 
gratitude and our unwavering support. Our legislation does not cut off 
funds for armor and protective equipment still needed by our troops in 
the war zone.

No exit strategy will succeed unless it has broad public support. I 
support H.R. 645 as a responsible approach to ending the war by 
focusing on U.S. policy and on the now outdated congressional 
authorization for the use of force. Citizens deserve to know where 
their elected officials stand on the war and not just on the 
escalation. I have let my constituents in Maine know where I stand and 
how I believe Congress should take a long overdue leadership role in 
ending this war.
