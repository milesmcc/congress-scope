Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Going on 5. Sixty to 65 percent of Iraqis believe 
it is okay to kill Americans, to shoot at Americans. We are in the 
middle of a civil war and we need to get ourselves out of it, not get 
ourselves further into it. So these hearings are an important component 
of that, to try to pull ourselves out of this situation that President 
Bush has gotten us into.

I say that because--for several reasons. One is, some people say 
well, if you have an end date, then they are just going to sit back and 
wait until we leave. The problem with that theory is if we say we are 
going to stay forever, then they are never going to do their share, and 
the problem has been the Iraqi soldiers won't get trained, the problem 
is we can't get a political solution because everyone thinks we are 
just going to stay there and keep the situation intact.

They need a goal, and the goal is, in our supplemental bill, if you 
do not have improvement in some of the benchmarks we have in there, 
political and military, if you don't have improvement by July, we are 
getting out. If you are showing some progress, we will give you until 
the end of the year, until the fall. And if you haven't met the goals 
by then, then we are out.

You have got to meet your obligations. Believe me, I didn't support 
this


war from the get-go, and it kills me, it kills me, that we have got to 
spend $100 billion to get us out of a situation. That kills me.

This last couple of weeks we have had hearings in the Labor, Health 
and Education Subcommittee on Appropriations, and you see the millions 
of dollars the Bush administration submitted that they cut from 
physical education programs, art programs. They flatlined TRIO, GEAR 
UP, Upward Bound. All flatlined, with thousands of more kids going into 
those. Head Start. Only 60 percent of the kids eligible for Head Start 
get covered. There is a $100 million cut in Head Start, and we are 
going to go spend $100 billion?

I am voting for the supplemental, because I will do anything to get 
us out of there, and I believe this supplemental is the best step for 
us to take to get us out of there.

But it is not only what is going on in Iraq, Mr. Meek. I don't know 
if you had a chance to see this memo.
