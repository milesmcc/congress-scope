Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, the Minnesota Red Bulls are not an energy 
drink, but let me tell you about what an amazing energy force they have 
been for our freedom in the United States.

They are now returning home from the longest continuous deployment of 
any U.S. military unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The Red Bulls hail from the 1st Brigade, 34th Infantry Division of 
the Minnesota National Guard based in Bloomington, Minnesota.

Mr. Speaker, these men and women are true citizen soldiers. They have 
put service to their country ahead of their family, of their friends, 
and their careers since September of 2005.

During their deployment, let me tell you what the Red Bulls have done 
for our country, Mr. Speaker. They completed 5,200 combat logistical 
patrols. They secured 2.4 million convoy miles, and they discovered 462 
improvised explosive devices prior to detonation. In addition, they 
completed 137 reconstruction projects and helped start two Iraqi 
newspapers for the local population that covered stories on these 
reconstruction projects.

On behalf of a grateful Nation and a free world, we welcome back the 
Minnesota Red Bulls and we thank you.
