Mr. CASEY. Finally, I want to speak for a couple of moments about a 
Pennsylvanian. As I have mentioned before, there are more World War II 
Medal of Honor winners from Pennsylvania than anywhere else. We did 
some research, and you can go down the list of people who have served 
from Pennsylvania, who have been awarded the Congressional Medal of 
Honor, and we note that 378 Pennsylvanians have received the Medal of 
Honor out of about 3,467 overall, so a high percentage.

We had 25 Medal of Honor winners from World War II and in Operation 
Iraqi Freedom; one is the person I want to spend a couple of moments 
talking about. Operation Iraqi Freedom has only four, I am told, four 
Medal of Honor winners across the Nation, so Pennsylvania has one of 
those four, and his name is Specialist Ross A. McGinnis, 1st Platoon, C 
Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat 
Team, 1st Infantry Division.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 
a two-page document entitled, ''The Story of PFC Ross A. McGinnis,'' as 
well as a news story from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette from this week.
