`Mr. SPECTER â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. SPECTER. As a final statement, it is my hope that the majority 
leader, Senator Reid, and Republican leader, Senator McConnell, before 
the day is up, will come to terms and will announce some accommodation 
so that there can be a fair resolution of the debate--so this body does 
not become irrelevant and we do not present a picture to the American 
people of gridlock and paralysis, but we show we are still the world's 
greatest deliberative body because we are about to cede that title to 
the House of Representatives which as we speak is deliberating, which 
we are not doing--and that we take up the Iraqi issue and we show the 
American people and the world we can reach an accommodation, we can 
debate in accordance with the traditions of the Senate.

I ask my colleagues to seriously consider the resolution I introduced 
to change rule XV.

I agree with Senator Byrd. We do not need more rules, but we need a 
little modification of rule XV.

I thank my colleague from Vermont and yield the floor.
