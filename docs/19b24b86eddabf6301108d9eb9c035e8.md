Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the main responsibility of 
leadership is to lead, and that is exactly what Speaker Pelosi, 
Chairman Obey, Chairman Murtha and other members of the Democratic 
leadership team are doing, and they are doing it with a plan.

My constituents who want this war ended as quickly as possible can 
take heart in the fact that this supplemental sets a time certain to 
begin to pull our troops out of Iraq and bring them to a peace-loving 
home, a home where we value peace, a home where the will of the people 
is listened to and heard, a home where we will continue to protect and 
promote democracy.

I support our troops, I support leadership, I support peace, and I 
support this legislation.
