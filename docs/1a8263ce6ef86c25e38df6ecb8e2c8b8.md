Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise 
today to honor the life of Sergeant Joshua Kirk. Sergeant Kirk was 
tragically killed in Afghanistan on October 3.

On Tuesday morning, I attended his funeral at St. Michael's Church in 
Exeter, New Hampshire. There were so many relatives and friends in 
attendance for a somber and moving ceremony. His wife, Megan, a native 
of Exeter, and his daughter, Kensington, have lost a husband and 
father, and this Nation has lost a hero.

Sergeant Kirk selflessly put himself in harm's way in service to 
America. He and his family are owed a debt of gratitude.

Sergeant Kirk, a native of Maine, joined the United States Army in 
2005. He was on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan when his base 
was attacked by insurgents on October 3. Kirk and seven of his 
courageous fellow soldiers, all based out of Fort Carson, were killed 
during the long battle.

Sergeant Kirk's memory lives on with his wife, daughter, mother and 
sisters. We will always remember his sacrifice, and theirs, and we are 
forever grateful for their patriotism and service to America.
