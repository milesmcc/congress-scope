Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I voted in favor of the motion 
to instruct conferees, which included Senate language stating that 
''the Senate should not pass legislation that will undermine our 
military's ability to prevent a failed state in Iraq'', because I 
believe the men and women of the United States military are admirably 
and ably performing their duties. They are already doing everything the 
can to prevent Iraq from becoming a failed state, and I continue to 
support them and the professionalism and skill they have displayed. 
However, it is not the role of the United States military to control 
the long term viability of the Iraqi government. To avoid becoming a 
failed state, Iraqi political leaders must come to a consensus 
regarding the future of Iraq and the Iraqi government. There is no role 
for the United States military in that task. I continue to call for 
strong diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation in Iraq, and believe 
that a firm time-line for the withdrawal of U.S. troops will force 
Iraq's political leaders to take responsibility for the future of their 
country.
