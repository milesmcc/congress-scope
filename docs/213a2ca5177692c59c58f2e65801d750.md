Mr. McMAHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1321, a 
resolution expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to 
resolve the political crisis in Thailand peacefully and through 
democratic means.

Thailand has proven to be an essential ally of the United States. As 
a strong democracy in Southeast Asia, Thailand provides assistance to 
the United States on a number of fronts including in the war in 
Afghanistan and in curtailing North Korea's nuclear proliferation 
efforts by intercepting unauthorized shipments.

For these reasons and others (including a robust trading partnership 
between the U.S. and Thailand), Thailand must continue to be a reliable 
ally in the Southeast Asia region. The United States must make 
available all necessary diplomatic tools to re-engage all parties and 
come to a peaceful, yet decisive end to the domestic turmoil.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me today in support of solving the conflicts in Thailand 
peacefully and efficiently.
