Mr. STEVENS. I turn now to an issue that should be of concern to us 
all, and that is the safe transport of our civilian contractors into 
and out of Iraq and Afghanistan. On occasion, these U.S. citizens are 
flying on poorly regulated charter aircraft that are ultimately paid 
for by funds provided by Congress to the Department of Defense and the 
Department of State.
