Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the prices at the pump continue to hit 
record highs, House Democrats know that the


American people are struggling with these outrageously high prices. 
Some people are having to choose between buying gasoline and food. 
Others cannot afford to go to work.

Before the Bush administration conducted the bombing, the war and the 
occupation of Iraq, the price of gasoline was as low as $1.35 per 
gallon. Now it's over $4 per gallon. Oil was $23 a barrel. Now it's 
over $130 a barrel. There is no way, no way you can convince the 
American people that the price at the pump is not related to this 
misguided war and occupation of Iraq.

The effects of the Bush-Iraq recession, and that is what it is, are 
devastating our economy and wreaking havoc on the lives of families and 
children. It's time our Republican friends in the Bush administration 
join us in supporting our legislation to bring down the price of 
gasoline, and it is time to end the war and occupation of Iraq.

Believe me, this will bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.
