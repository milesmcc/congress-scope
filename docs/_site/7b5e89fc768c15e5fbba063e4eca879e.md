Mr. CARTER. Well, that's true. I want to thank you and I'm sure our 
soldiers want to thank you, too.

The trip that I was on, I had some wonderful Members of Congress who 
are here. A couple of them are here tonight. My friend Mr. Davis from 
Tennessee was there with us, and I believe that was his first trip to 
Iraq. I would like to yield to Mr. Davis.
