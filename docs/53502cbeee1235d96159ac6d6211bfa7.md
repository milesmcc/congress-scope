Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add to the comments of my good 
friend, the majority leader. I think we would have a better chance of 
moving this bill along if we could do what we have done on every other 
Iraq debate we have had this year, which is to simply enter into an 
agreement for a series of votes. If we end up in the position of filing 
cloture on every amendment, it is going to be quite a lengthy process 
and considerably inconvenient to both sides.

I hope after the vote this morning, we will get back to the way we 
have dealt with these issues in the past, which is through concurrence 
and agreement. A series of votes, obviously, with a 60-vote threshold--
this is the Senate; that is the way we have done it all year--would be 
fair to both sides and give both sides an opportunity to express 
themselves on the most important issue of our national defense.

I yield the floor.
