# IRAQ RESOLUTION
## `1fcc67bfb24b77f6f8f0564ba82e5f57`
`Mr. WARNER â€” 12 February 2007`

---


Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Maine. The Senator mentioned the 
bipartisan spirit. I am very pleased to state that Senator Levin, whom 
I spoke with this afternoon, Senator Ben Nelson, who has been with us 
steadily on this, and Senator Biden allowed with very extensive 
enthusiasm to


have their names attached as cosponsors.

I thank my colleagues who have come over and participated in this 
debate and others who have listened. I thank the distinguished Senator, 
my good friend from Nebraska, for working so hard on this amendment. We 
will fight on.

We may be idealists, but we will fight on for what we believe in and 
the integrity of this institution because we firmly believe, to the 
extent we can, forging a bipartisan consensus is the extent to which we 
can hopefully regain the full confidence of the American people on what 
we are doing in Iraq.

I agree with the President, we should not let it slip into a chaotic 
situation, but we do have some different constructive thoughts as to 
our strategy ahead.

I yield the floor.
