Mr. WICKER. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.

Madam Speaker, on December 31, 1776, with the fate of the Revolution 
in doubt, General George Washington faced a challenge of convincing his 
soldiers to stay in the fight. With their enlistments over, they wanted 
to go home. Washington made an impassioned plea and even offered 
volunteers a bonus. But no one responded. He spoke again, saying that 
all they held dear was at stake. And finally one man stepped forward. 
Then others followed.

Public opinion at that time was not on Washington's side. Only a 
third of the population supported the war for independence. One-third 
were openly hostile, and another one-third simply did not want to be 
involved.

We should be grateful that George Washington was not obsessed with 
public opinion polls.

Only days earlier Thomas Paine had written: ''These are the times 
that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, 
in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that 
stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, 
like hell, is not easily conquered.''

In the summer of 1863, Colonel Joshua Chamberlain of Maine faced a 
similar crisis. He had to convince a group of mutineers to stand and 
fight in a key battle. He promised to plead their case later if they 
rejoined the ranks. They did, and helped him win the Battle of 
Gettysburg.

Public opinion at that time was running against President Lincoln and 
the war. It was lasting longer and costing more than anticipated. In 
Congress, Democrats demanded the troops be brought home immediately, 
but Lincoln stood by his convictions and won the war.

It is easy for us to look back on these pivotal moments in our 
Nation's history without remembering how tough the going was, how 
reluctant many of our own people were, and how it took strong 
leadership to bring about victory.

Let's contrast those times with the situation today in Iraq. Clearly 
the American people are tired and impatient with this war, and many 
believe we cannot win. Yet troop morale is high. In testimony before 
Congress last week, the senior enlisted personnel from each service, 
the National Guard, and the Reserves, said our forces in Iraq believe 
in what they are doing and that positive things are being accomplished.

But you don't have to take their word for it. The enlistment and 
reenlistment figures themselves are a testimony to the commitment of 
our troops. All service branches met and exceeded their goals in both 
categories in 2006. The command sergeant major of the Marine Corps told 
our committee that young people join the Marines today to get to the 
fight. Knowing full well they will go to Iraq, they are signing up with 
enthusiasm and purpose. It almost takes your breath away to hear the 
troops who have been there say they continue to believe in our mission 
and want to see it through to completion.

I hear the same thing from my constituents who have returned from 
Iraq. They express frustration about the news media's focus on the bad 
news. Returning troops tell of their successes in helping steer Iraq 
toward a path of democracy and freedom.

I received an e-mail this week from a Mississippi soldier in Iraq. He 
said, ''No one wants everybody home more than I do, but we must finish 
the job. We are doing good things here and taking bad guys out of the 
game.''

The most important question in today's debate is what message does 
this resolution send to our military, to the volunteers who have been 
serving so proudly in harm's way? And make no mistake, they are 
listening to what we say here and watching what we do here. Will the 
passage of this resolution give our troops encouragement? I don't think 
so.

The Americans are conflicted about this war. A CBS poll this week 
showed that only 44 percent of Americans support this resolution; 45 
percent are opposed. That is all the more reason for leaders to lead. 
Washington and Lincoln were not concerned about public opinion polls. 
They did what was necessary to succeed, and that is what is called for 
in the halls of Congress today.

I am convinced that deep in their hearts, most Americans realize we 
are in a serious global war for survival against an enemy that wants to 
wipe us off the face of the Earth. When all is said and done, the 
American people want us to win this war. Success in Iraq is a key 
element in winning against the terrorists.

Osama bin Laden's chief deputy has urged al Qaeda operatives in Iraq 
to expel the Americans, extend the ''jihad wave'' to neighboring 
countries, and 2 weeks ago he spoke of Afghanistan and Iraq as two 
''most crucial fields.'' I regret to say that enemies like these will 
be pleased when this resolution passes.

Madam Speaker, let's send the terrorists a message of strength and 
resolve. Let's send a message of support and unity and confidence and 
appreciation to our troops. This resolution sends the wrong message, 
and I will vote against it.
