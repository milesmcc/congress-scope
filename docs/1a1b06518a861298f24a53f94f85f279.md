`Mr. DURBIN â€” 27 February 2008`

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my majority leader, Senator 
Reid, not only for his statement but also for bringing this matter to 
the floor. I especially thank Senator Feingold. I have been happy to 
cosponsor this measure.

I believe, as do many of us today, that the decision to invade Iraq 
was, in fact, the worst foreign policy decision of our time, maybe 
beyond that. We will pay a heavy price for it, but we will not pay a 
price as a nation as great as the price paid by the families who have 
lost in combat a son or daughter or husband or wife they dearly loved. 
Those men and women are true heroes.
