`Mr. KLEIN of Florida â€” 31 October 2007`

Mr. KLEIN of Florida. We are very proud to have the gentleman from 
Tennessee as one of our colleagues and a great contributor to the 
freshman class, particularly on accountability. There have been so many 
members of our class that came in with the criticism of our campaigns 
that we had heard from so many people back home, who is the check and 
balance? Who is minding the store? What happened to that $8 billion of 
cash that disappeared on the streets of Iraq? What's with Blackwater? 
What's with all these kinds of things? Who is checking what's going on 
here?

You know, it's one thing to say you are going to run things like a 
business, it's another to do it. Businesses have known checks and 
balances, shareholders, managers, things like that. Unfortunately, it 
wasn't happening with this government. It's now changing.

I am very proud of you and the others. I am very proud to have 
another gentleman with us, the gentleman from Vermont, who has been at 
the forefront of the committee itself, working with Mr. Waxman. I know 
you have been very vocal on these issues, so I am going to turn it over 
to the gentleman, Mr. Welch, from Vermont.
