Mr. HOYER. I appreciate your yielding and appreciate your 
observation. Although I am not now on the Appropriations Committee, you 
are correct, I served there for 25 years. I am on leave. I have no 
expectation of going back soon, I hope.

In any event, the gentleman is correct. As you know, the bill we are 
talking about is probably, as we discussed on the floor, one of, if not 
the most important bill that we might consider this year on funding our 
troops, supporting our troops in Iraq, and dealing with the policy that 
we are pursuing in Iraq.

Obviously there is a broad spectrum of views on that. Just as 
obviously, if you had some bills that in many instances come with an 
open rule, very frankly, I don't know about your experience, but our 
experience has been that there are a wide range of views.

It may well be that we will solicit a request for possible amendments 
and make decisions on them, because this is, to some degree, as you 
know, not a straight appropriations bill in the sense that this is 
where the money is, in or out, up or down. This is a consideration of 
policy and authorizing bills. Usually the tradition is to have 
amendments offered in the Rules Committee and the Rules Committee 
determines which amendments they want to make in order.

I cannot anticipate what we are going to do at this point in time. 
The gentleman's point is well taken, but we will have to see how we 
want to bring to this floor to try to reflect in the final product, as 
best we can, the views of the American people, which are divided, and I 
think will be reflected in the floor vote on that bill.
