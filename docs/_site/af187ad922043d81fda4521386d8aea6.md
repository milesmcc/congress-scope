Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2264, the No Oil 
Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007.

First, I would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from 
Michigan, Chairman Conyers, for his hard work and his leadership on 
this bill. We have worked together in previous Congresses to move this 
bill, and I am very pleased to see it moving on the floor here today.

I also want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe 
Lofgren) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller) for their 
leadership in supporting the passage of this legislation as well.

Since last week when we first considered this bill, gas prices have 
increased another 10 cents to a record level in this country of over 
$3.27 a gallon. Before heading to the airport to come back here from my 
district in Cincinnati, just yesterday, I filled up in my 1993 Buick 
and it was $3.19 in Cincinnati by the University of Cincinnati, $32. 
And my constituents back home in Cincinnati are very concerned, and 
rightly so, particularly as we enter the peak summer driving season, 
which begins this weekend.

I happen to have a tele-town hall meeting where hundreds and 
hundreds, probably thousands of people in my district were on the line 
and we were talking about a range of issues, this issue, high gas 
prices in my district. And as Chairman Conyers mentioned, the State of 
Michigan has the highest in the whole country. People are really 
concerned about this; this is really hitting hard and it is something 
that we need to deal with in this Congress.

I am very disappointed in the President that this message indicates, 
whether or not they know how to spell the word ''President,'' that they 
are going to veto this bill if it is passed. I think we ought to send 
it to the President and let the chips fall where they may. This is long 
overdue legislation. I urge its passage.

The other issue, by the way, which was of great interest to my 
constituents last night in the tele-town hall meeting was, not 
surprisingly, the immigration issue. We heard the Senate reached an 
agreement just recently on, in my view, an extremely flawed agreement 
which is going to be debated over there and then debated over here. 
Those are the two principal issues my people back in Cincinnati are 
concerned about.

These continued price hikes take their toll on consumers directly at 
the gas pump, as well as impacting their everyday lives and raising the 
cost of things like going to the grocery store or going to work or even 
planning a vacation. I mean, this is the time when people are deciding 
whether they are going to take the kids to King's Island up the road 
from my district in Cincinnati, or if they are going to go to Disney 
World down in Florida in Mr. Keller's area. But when you have gas 
prices at $3.20-plus per gallon, this is not only going to put a damper 
on vacation and disappointing our kids, but it is significantly going 
to weigh down this economy.

I think there is no question that if gas prices remain this high, it 
is going to have a significant impact on the economy. Jobs and other 
things are at risk.

Passing H.R. 2264 would be a positive first step to allaying concerns 
that the American public has expressed about these uncontrollable price 
surges. Over the last decade, it has become alarmingly clear that 
America is far too dependent on foreign oil to meet our energy needs. 
Disturbingly, we import, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, more 
than two-thirds of the oil we consume, much of it from OPEC, and much 
of it from some of the more unstable areas of the world--Iran, Iraq, 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and of course we get 
some from Nigeria and Venezuela. As Mr. Keller mentioned, we have down 
there Mr. Chavez who seems to be following in the footsteps of Fidel 
Castro. Those are the types of countries that we are depending on for 
our oil, and that has to change.

At the same time the number of refineries operating in the United 
States has decreased from over 300, 324 to be exact back in 1981, to 
fewer than 150, 148 to be exact. So we have cut the number of 
refineries available in half over that period of time, and we haven't 
built another oil refinery since 1976, over 30 years ago now.

There is no doubt that we need to focus on both short-term and long-
term


strategies to address these issues. We need increased domestic 
production and refining capabilities, and we need to put a stronger 
emphasis on alternative energy and conservation efforts.



But this strategy to make us less oil-dependent and to put us on more 
sound footing also has to include breaking up the cartels that play a 
primary role in manipulating, and I emphasize manipulating, the market. 
We talk about supply and demand and all that, but OPEC countries are 
manipulating the supply of oil in the world.

For decades, OPEC nations have conspired, and again I emphasize that, 
conspired to limit supplies and to drive up prices of imported crude 
oil, gouging American consumers, in violation of our Nation's antitrust 
laws. OPEC accounts for more than two-thirds of the global oil 
production and exports more than 65 percent of the oil traded 
internationally. Thus, it's abundantly clear that OPEC's influence in 
the market dominates.

H.R. 2264, as some of my colleagues have already mentioned, attempts 
to break up this cartel and subject these colluders and their 
anticompetitive practices to the antitrust scrutiny that they so richly 
deserve. Specifically, this bill would amend the Sherman Act to make it 
illegal for foreign countries to collude, to restrain output or fix 
prices of oil, gas or any petroleum product. In addition, this bill 
gives the Attorney General the authority to enforce the antitrust 
provisions against these nations.

Importantly, the bill also anticipates any protected nation defense 
or immunity that OPEC nations may proffer, specifically exempting them 
from the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act if they are engaged in 
price fixing, which they clearly are, or other anticompetitive 
activities with regard to pricing or production or distribution.

This bill is a necessary and appropriate response to deal with those 
who are not willing to deal fairly with the American consumer. I urge 
my colleagues to support competition and consumers by supporting H.R. 
2264.

And I want to again thank Mr. Conyers for his leadership in this 
area. It's far overdue that we pass this act.
