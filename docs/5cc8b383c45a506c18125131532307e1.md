Mr. HUNTER. I would just say to my friend from California, he is 
consistent with the Iraq Study Group to the extent of 21,500 troops, 
which has been described by your side of the debate as very substantial 
and such an important thing and such a major thing that it should be 
stopped. So that, obviously, is not an inconsequential aspect of the 
Iraq Study Group's statement.
