Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, over the past 3 
months, the new Democratic Congress has reached across the aisle to 
work with Republicans on legislation that is going to produce positive 
results for the American people. We vowed to run this House differently 
than the Republicans, and since day one, we have lived up to that 
promise.

During our first 100 hours, we passed legislation increasing the 
minimum wage, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, making college 
more affordable, securing our Nation by implementing the 9/11 
recommendations and ending subsidies for big oil companies.

Since that time, we passed legislation that changes the direction of 
the war in Iraq, but also fully funding our troops and supporting our 
veterans. At the end of last month, we also passed a budget resolution 
that balances our budget within 5 years, something that the Bush 
administration and his budgets have not been able to do.

Not only is our budget fiscally responsible, it also increases the 
funding for children's health care, for education and for veterans 
health care, all without raising taxes. Yes, we are going in a new 
direction.
