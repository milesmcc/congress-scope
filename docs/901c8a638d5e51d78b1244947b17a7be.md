Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, as The Washington Post says today: ''Altogether, the 
House Democratic leadership has come up with more than $20 billion of 
new spending, much of it wasted subsidies. And it makes us wonder how 
$74 million to extend peanut storage payments or $250 million for MILC 
subsidies will aid our troops.''

Perhaps my colleagues believe that these agricultural subsidies are 
necessary, but I don't see how they are going to help us defeat 
Islamist terrorists. Is this really what General Petraeus needs? Is 
this what he asked for? No, it is not. And it is bad policy to start, 
and it is worse by mixing it without backing of our forces in the 
field.

It is not just the language that gives us pause here. If it is our 
mission to win in Iraq, then we should not be making it more difficult 
for our troops to succeed. Cutting off funding and micromanaging a war 
does that, according to our commanders in the field. And as The Post 
adds: ''The bill excludes the judgment of General Petraeus, excludes 
the judgment of the U.S. commanders who would have to execute the 
retreat that the bill mandates.''

And as The Post goes on to say: ''Democrats should not seek to use 
pork to buy a majority for an unconditional retreat that the majority 
does not support.''
