`Mr. WAXMAN â€” 16 October 2007`

Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out that we asked Mr. 
Butler from the State Department questions such as whether the Maliki 
government is working hard to improve the corruption situation so that 
he can unite his country. We were told he could not answer that 
question unless we went into closed session, which would mean that if 
he answered it in closed session, it would be a national security 
violation for any of us to report his response. That was what was so 
offensive. They did not want to even discuss a broad kind of questions 
which go to the nature of our bilateral relations with Iraq how they 
are doing and what our efforts are doing and whether we are succeeding 
in stopping the corruption in Iraq, which is jeopardizing our mission 
and endangering our troops.

I would like to now yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky 
(Mr. Yarmuth).
