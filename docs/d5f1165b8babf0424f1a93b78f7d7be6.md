`Mr. LANTOS â€” 10 September 2007`

---


Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution 
and yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, we have before us today a resolution whose purpose is, 
''Recognizing September 11 as a day of remembrance,'' extending 
sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives on September 11, 
2001, ''honoring the heroic actions of our Nation's first responders 
and Armed Forces, and reaffirming the commitment of defending the 
people of the United States against any and all future challenges.''

Certainly, Mr. Speaker, I remember. Like millions of others in this 
country and around the globe, I remember exactly where I was and what I 
was doing when I first heard the news of this hideous atrocity.

Like millions of others, I was profoundly shocked, sickened, and 
horrified by the scenes I saw unfolding that day. And in me there grew 
a cold anger. We will get those who did this, I said to myself back 
then. No matter how long it takes, we will defeat them. We will do 
everything in our power to protect the people of the United States.

Recently, Mr. Speaker, we took a major step in that direction by 
enacting, with bipartisan support, legislation to implement the 
recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. By so doing, we addressed major 
security vulnerabilities, improving our homeland security across the 
board.

But much more needs to be done. Al Qaeda remains a serious threat to 
the United States. The leadership of that group has been reconstituted 
and the terrorists have formed many small independent cells. One such 
cell was broken up just within the last few days in Germany.

In order to triumph in the war of ideas with the extremists, we need 
to learn how best to use many forms of soft power, economic, financial, 
diplomatic, and cultural, which are available to us and to our allies.

We in Congress can help by making sure that the foreign operations 
budget is fully funded, our principle instrument of soft power. We need 
to stop frittering away our resources, military, diplomatic and 
economic, on a ceaseless religious war in Iraq.

The administration is making its case before Congress this week to 
stay the course in the Iraq war, which it continues cynically to 
conflate with the global balance struggle against fundamentalist 
extremism, even with the 9/11 attacks themselves. It continues to 
disturb me to hear the administration linking Iraq with the attacks 
perpetrated by Osama bin Laden and his thugs, especially when they are 
still at large.

The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that we will not forget what really 
happened on that dark day 6 years ago. We will not forget the victims 
of 9/11, or the heroic first responders who sacrificed their lives, or 
the fighting men and women who carried the battle to the mountains of 
Afghanistan and rooted out the Taliban.

We recommit ourselves today, as we have each year at this time for 
the past 6 years, to continue the fight against those who seek to 
destroy our American way of life, to deny us our constitutional rights 
and our freedoms.

We will not forget. We will not falter in our resolve to protect our 
homeland. We shall remember our heroes.



Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
