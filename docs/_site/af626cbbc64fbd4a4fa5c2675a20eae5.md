Mr. McCONNELL. I am sure the majority leader and I will debate the 
substance of this later this morning. The Webb amendment is a clear 
interference with the President's authority to deploy troops, the 
authority of the Secretary of Defense, and the authority of the 
generals. Suffice it to say, getting 60 votes for a measure is not 
unusual in the Senate. It certainly has been the case with regard to 
controversial issues like Iraq all year long. That will continue to be 
the case on this bill throughout its consideration.
