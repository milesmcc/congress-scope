# CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES
## `6ac0130317b6a6f1d1f42d3f535231f3`
`Mr. YARMUTH â€” 24 October 2007`

---


Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman. And it's interesting because, 
again, you can find a foundation for all these things we're doing in 
these very words in article I, because one of our responsibilities is 
to provide for the general welfare. And when we're talking about the 
minimum wage, we're talking about the general welfare of the people.

I would like to return to our distinguished president, who has a 
distinguished military record of his own, since we've been talking 
about our efforts with regard to Iraq and the military.
