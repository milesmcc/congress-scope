Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I will tell the gentleman that very definitely it's being discussed. 
We believe this is a cost of war. We have over 4,000 families who have 
lost husbands, wives, brothers and sisters. We have over 30,000 
severely injured. Obviously, the GI bill for those who came home from 
World War II and Korea had very good benefits that were helpful to 
them. Unfortunately, particularly with respect to our Guard and 
Reserve, that is not the case.

Jim Webb, the former Secretary of the Navy, now the Senator from 
Virginia, as you know, has introduced a bill. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin 
on this side has also introduced a bill. Others have introduced 
legislation trying to make sure that the veterans who are coming home 
from Iraq that have been deployed for long periods of time, have had 
their lives very substantially disrupted, their families' lives 
disrupted, fighting for their country, that this is a cost of war.

We are trying to address this, and the gentleman is correct, there is 
discussion about, as a cost of war, having this proceed to the 
President perhaps on the supplemental. That is under discussion. That 
decision has not been made. But it's certainly very high on our 
priority list to take care of these veterans that have come home and 
give them the kind of benefits that we think they are due as great 
patriots who have sacrificed for our country.
