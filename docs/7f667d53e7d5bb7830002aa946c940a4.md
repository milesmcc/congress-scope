`Mr. SPECTER â€” 10 April 2008`

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Peter Keisler has waited for 650 days, 
and soon, it will be the 2-year anniversary of his nomination. So the 
real question is not fairness to Republicans; it is a question of 
fairness to the American people. The American people have not been 
treated fairly, and they have not been treated fairly by the Democrats, 
and they weren't treated fairly by Republicans when President Clinton 
sent nominees to this floor.

It is high time this stops. That is why I have introduced a 
resolution that would establish a protocol. The protocol would be, 
after a nominee is


nominated, there be a hearing and then there is a committee vote. Then, 
the nominee comes before the full Senate and we start to follow the 
Constitution. There is nothing in the Constitution about filibusters. 
The Constitution talks about the President's prerogatives to nominate 
and the Senate's duty to consent or not to consent.

The majority leader made a big to-do about its being a matter of 
quality, not a matter of quantity. Well, if the majority doesn't like 
the quality, all they have to do is vote the nominee down. All I am 
asking for is up-or-down votes. If they don't like the quality, say so. 
Say so. I think that, on an examination of the record, there would be 
no real issue about quality. These are quality people. But, if I am 
wrong, and their judgment is to the contrary, I will abide by that. 
Vote no. Don't consent. Follow the Constitution and don't consent.

We have real problems with going forward when the chairman talks 
about judicial vacancies not being the most pressing problem in 
comparison to unemployment, the economy, and Iraq. I agree there are 
problems of greater immediacy. But, we have time to handle them all. We 
might have to work on Mondays and Fridays. A lot of Americans work on 
Saturdays. We could come in a little earlier, and we could use the 
floor time a little more efficiently.

I do believe it is time we took stock in what we are doing in this 
body. You can cite the statistics in many different directions, but I 
think the real critical statistics are what has happened in the last 2 
years during President Bush's Administration in comparison to President 
Clinton's final two years. There is a decisive discrepancy there. A 
Republican Senate confirmed 15 of President Clinton's circuit judges in 
his final two years in comparison to 6 for President Bush before the 
nominees are considered today. I hope it will go up to 7. President 
Clinton had 57 district judges and President Bush had 34, and I expect 
it will go up to 38 today. Over the 8-year terms of the two Presidents, 
President Clinton had 65 circuit judges and President Bush had 57; 
President Clinton had 305 district court judges, and President Bush had 
237 judges.

So I hope we can move through the morass we find ourselves in. If we 
don't, there is going to be an election this year, and there may be a 
Democrat in the White House. I don't know what is going to happen. It 
is a close matter. The American people will decide that.

At some point, there will be another Democrat in the White House, if 
not on this election, and there will be retaliation because one insult 
begets another. As one side exacerbates, so does the other. The 20-year 
record is not a good record as to what we have here. I urge a truce.

On a personal level, no two Senators in this body have a closer 
relationship than Senator Leahy and myself. It goes back a long time 
when we had important jobs--when he was a prosecuting attorney and I 
was the same. We have worked together very closely, but we have a 
disagreement on this issue.

I believe the Republican caucus is right today in its position, and I 
am prepared to lead the caucus on the issue. That is my job in my 
capacity as ranking member. When the Republican caucus was wrong, I 
said so, and I voted with the Democrats on the Clinton nominees.
