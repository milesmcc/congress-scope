`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 24 May 2007`

---


Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, nearly 6 years after the worst 
terrorist attacks in American history, we have yet to be hit again on 
our soil. No one would have thought this possible immediately after the 
9/11 attacks. But it is true because America is on offense in the war 
on terror.

Memorial Day is a time to reflect on the brave men and women of the 
Armed Forces who have made that achievement possible, and to honor 
their sacrifice. Since 2001, over 3,800 Americans have died fighting in 
Iraq or Afghanistan. Over 60 were from Kentucky.

Our country must honor those who died in the line of duty as well as 
their families. The debt we owe them can never be repaid. I have had 
the honor of meeting many of the families of these servicemembers, and 
I have told them their loved ones did not die in vain.

Many who fought in the war on terror live to tell their stories, and 
I recently heard one I had like to share involving soldiers from Fort 
Campbell, KY. Four soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry 
Regiment, 101st Airborne Division lived up to the warrior ethos of 
never leaving a fallen or wounded comrade behind.

The city of Ramadi, Iraq, has seen some of the worst battles between 
coalition forces and the terrorists. One night in March 2006, SGT 
Jeremy Wilzcek, SGT Michael Row, PFC Jose Alvarez and PFC Gregory 
Pushkin, among others, made their way through the city's narrow alleys 
back to base.

Suddenly Sergeant Row saw two figures run into a house. Immediately 
suspicious, he stopped the team in its tracks just as machine-gun and 
small-arms fire and grenades erupted on the street in front of them. 
The soldiers took cover and returned fire.

Private First Class Alvarez noticed a fellow soldier had been hit and 
was lying in the middle of the storm of bullets. Without thinking 
twice, he ran into the line of fire and threw himself over his comrade. 
But he was too late. The soldier was dead.

Private First Class Alvarez kept firing until he had unloaded his 
weapon at the enemy, and then stood up and began to carry the soldier's 
body to a safe area. Sergeant Row provided cover fire, while Sergeant 
Wilzcek and Private First Class Pushkin ran into the firefight to help 
Private First Class Alvarez carry their colleague.

The three soldiers were nearing cover when two rocket-propelled 
grenades exploded yards away from them, knocking all three down and 
slicing Private First Class Alvarez's knee with shrapnel. But the three 
continued, finally reaching a safe area out of the path of bullets.

Sergeant Wilzcek and Private First Class Pushkin then ran back into 
the enemy's kill zone several times, rescuing more trapped soldiers. 
Sergeant Row continued to lay down cover fire, even though the same 
explosion that injured Private First Class Alvarez's knee had buried 
shrapnel deep in his elbow. Finally, every soldier made it to a safe 
area.

They were out of immediate danger. But gunfire all around them made 
clear the terrorists were still out to kill. Sergeant Wilzcek, Sergeant 
Row and Private First Class Pushkin made their way to the roof of a 
building, and with the advantage of the high ground, successfully 
killed, captured or drove off


the terrorists, enabling the squad to return to base safely.

This February, now-Staff Sergeant Wilzcek and now-Specialists Alvarez 
and Pushkin were awarded the Silver Star, the third-highest award given 
for valor in the face of the enemy. Sergeant Row was awarded the Bronze 
Star for Valor.

Their acts of heroism rank them among the finest America has to 
offer. But what I find most amazing is that they are everyday people 
who could be your neighbor, coworker or relative. And we have thousands 
more brave Americans in uniform all willing to do the same.

So this Memorial Day, remember the courage of our servicemen and 
women, performing extraordinary feats just like the men of Fort 
Campbell. Remember the sacrifice of those who don't make it back home. 
As long as America has fighters of such spirit, we can never be 
defeated on the battlefield.
