Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to use this opportunity to say a 
few words about an amendment that will be voted on later this 
afternoon, and it is the Sanders-Dorgan Yellow Ribbon outreach 
amendment, No. 2601.

Every Member of the Senate knows that we have seen many thousands of 
soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and they have come home 
with post-traumatic stress disorder in very large numbers. They have 
come home with traumatic brain injury, TBI, also at frightening 
numbers. The government, in a number of ways, has developed many 
programs to try to provide help and medical care for these brave 
soldiers and for their families.

In Vermont, a couple of years ago, we helped establish what I think 
is an excellent program that many other States around the country are 
beginning to look at, and the basic premise of the program we have 
established in Vermont is that while it is enormously important to make 
sure those who come home from Iraq and Afghanistan get the best 
services possible, we establish those health care services, those 
services don't mean anything unless the soldiers are able to take 
advantage of the services.

Given the nature of PTSD and TBI, that is sometimes, especially for 
the members of the Reserve and National Guard, very difficult. So you 
will have instances, especially in rural America, where people will 
come home from Iraq, they are going to be in emotional trouble, and 
there are going to be strains and stresses on their families, with 
their kids. They may be suffering from PTSD, but one of the symptoms of 
PTSD is you do not stand up and say: You know what, I have troubles and 
I need help. That is not what you do.

What we established in Vermont was an outreach program which was 
largely filled with the veterans from Iraq who would go out to the 
communities and drop in and sit down with soldiers and their wives face 
to face and just get a sense of how they are doing and through that 
personal visitation suggest to them that if there is a problem, they 
might want to take advantage of the services the VA is providing, which 
in my State are quite good, and to make them aware that it is not 
unusual, that they are not the only people who are dealing with PTSD or 
TBI. In truth, this outreach program has been quite successful.



Some years ago, the Congress established a Yellow Ribbon Program 
which is doing a good job, and the goal of that program is to educate 
people who come home from Iraq and Afghanistan about the services 
available to them. But we have not yet funded the kind of strong 
outreach effort that I believe we need where we are literally sending 
people out to National Guard families, especially maybe in rural areas, 
and making them understand that their problems are not unique, that 
there are services available to help them.

So outreach is the word here. We do it in Vermont in a very informal 
way, just person to person.

This amendment is $20 million, and the offset comes from the $126 
billion in funds in title IX of the bill. It does not cut any one 
particular account. This $20 million represents a fraction of 1 percent 
of the entire title.

So the issue here is that we have a serious problem with PTSD and 
TBI. I think it is terribly important that we do everything we can on a 
personal level to reach out to the families to get them the services 
they need. But, once again, you can have the greatest service in the 
world--I know we are trying. The Department of Defense is trying its 
best--but those services don't mean anything if veterans don't access 
them. So the goal is to get people into the services.

I would very much appreciate support for the Sanders-Dorgan amendment 
which will be coming up in a while.

I yield the floor.
