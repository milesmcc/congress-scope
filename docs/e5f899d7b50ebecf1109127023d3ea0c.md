Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.

Mr. Chairman, I'd like to associate myself with the comments of the 
gentlewoman from Tennessee. I, too, appreciate the leadership of the 
gentleman from Iowa in offering this amendment.

Again, the dollars may be small but the principle is large, and 
frankly, Mr. Chairman, I really somewhat object to those who somehow 
suggest that after a budget was passed in this institution, 
representing the largest single tax increase in American history, that 
somehow amendments to try to save the people's money are somehow 
dilatory, are somehow frivolous, are somehow not worthy of debate in 
this democratic institution.

We spent months, months debating one spending bill on whether or not 
to support our troops in Iraq, months, and now we hear protests from 
the other side, hours into a regular appropriations bill. Somehow after 
hours we've grown tired of that particular process.

Mr. Chairman, I'm worried about this largest single tax increase in 
American history and what it means to people in my district, the Fifth 
District of Texas, how it impacts their ability to send their children 
to college, how it impacts their ability to start a small business, how 
it impacts their ability to pay their health care premiums. Every 
opportunity we have to try to get some of that money back to them is an 
important use of this body's time, a very important use.

And so there are several amendments that have a very simple 
proposition behind them, and the simple proposition is in this 
particular Department, can't you level-fund from one year to the next 
year just that group administering the programs. All over America, 
after passing this single largest tax increase in the history, we're 
asking American families to somehow do with less, and all we're asking 
these people to do is do with the same amount that you had last year. 
That's all that we're asking, Mr. Chairman.

But there are bigger issues involved here besides the roughly $2,600, 
$2,700 per family in the Fifth District of Texas who are going to have 
to pay that single largest tax increase in history.

But we look to the future, and we know what happens if we don't take 
the first few steps towards fiscal sanity. Already we have been warned 
by the Congressional Budget Office, we've been warned by the Office of 
Management and Budget, we've been warned by the Comptroller General 
what is going to happen to this Nation if we don't do something about 
entitlement spending, something that our friends on the other side of 
the aisle refuse to engage in. Social Security and Medicare, in their 
budget, there's nothing about that.

We've heard from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke: Without early 
and meaningful action to address the rapid growth in entitlements, the 
U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations 
bearing much of the cost. Too much expenditure of the people's money 
impacts the people's security.

We've heard from Comptroller General Walker: The rising costs of 
government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic 
consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.

How are we going to pay for future homeland security bills if we 
don't take the first few steps towards fiscal responsibility now? 
Simply level-fund, level-fund, not cut, level-fund the administrative 
function and lead by example. Lead by example.

Mr. Chairman, we haven't even talked about the secret earmark slush 
fund yet, which, again, I don't understand. I would think if there was 
any party who would heed the lessons well of the last election, it 
would be the party that has become the majority party. They know the 
people are outraged at earmarks, at the process, and so instead of 
taking this forward, the new majority is taking us backwards.

Now, Mr. Chairman, I don't want to necessarily personalize debate, so 
I will paraphrase here, but recently the Wisconsin State Journal, and I 
paraphrase, said the Democrats are now dodging the very reforms they 
helped to generate, and that with this new secret slush fund, and I 
paraphrase once again, it would prevent lawmakers from questioning 
earmarks.
