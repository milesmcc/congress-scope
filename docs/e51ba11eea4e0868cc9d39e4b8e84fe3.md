Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a brave American 
soldier who sacrificed his life in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom, U.S. Army Specialist Bryn Todd Raver.

Bryn joined the Army in December of 2007, following in the steps of 
his grandfather, a Korean War veteran. Bryn was assigned to the 1st 
Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 101st Airborne Division at Fort 
Campbell, Kentucky. He served as a military policeman and deployed to 
Afghanistan in April of 2010. Commanding officers noted that Specialist 
Raver was the first to prepare for a mission and the last to leave.
