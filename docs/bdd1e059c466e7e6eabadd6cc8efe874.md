# U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,
## `bdd1e059c466e7e6eabadd6cc8efe874`
`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 23 March 2007`

Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I rise in 
opposition to the bill.

Four years ago, Congress was told we had no alternative but to go to 
war. That was wrong. Now Congress is telling the American people, we 
have no alternative but to continue the war for just another year or 
two, and then we will be able to end the war. So war equals peace. I 
don't think so.

This war now has a momentum of its own, which has captured even 
people of good will who say they want peace but are going to vote to 
keep us at war. The same false logic that trapped Members into voting 
for the war is trapping Members into voting to continue the war.

I believe you cannot say you are for peace and vote to keep this war 
going. You cannot say you are for peace and facilitate the theft of 
Iraqi oil. You cannot say you are for peace and give the President 
money not just to keep this war going but to attack Iran if he so 
chooses.

If you want peace, vote for peace now. If you want peace, stop 
funding the war. If you want peace, stand for the truth.
