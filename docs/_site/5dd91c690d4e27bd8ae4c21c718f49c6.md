Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand today with my fellow 
veterans in the House of Representatives to register our opposition to 
the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq and to show our 
support for our men and women in uniform.

Last November 7th, the American people sent a clear message to 
Congress and the President: we must end the war in Iraq.

Now, after nearly four years of bloodshed, death and destruction, 
Congress is likely to go on the record as opposing the plan for 
escalating the war. No longer will Congress stand by while the 
President wages a war that defies logic, common sense and human 
decency. This week, we shall take a stand. This week, we tell the 
administration: ''Enough is enough. Stop ignoring the American people. 
Stop ignoring your generals and retired generals, including Colin 
Powell. Stop ignoring the foreign policy experts. Stop wasting American 
lives and resources on this disastrous, unnecessary conflict.''

This debate represents an important turning point in the public 
dialogue about Iraq, and so I welcome it. But it is not enough. The 
escalation must be stopped, but we cannot let the momentum against the 
war subside after we deal with the escalation. Our priority must remain 
ending the fighting and dying in Iraq.

We must end the senseless deaths of service members like Marine 
Tarryl Hill of Southfield, Michigan, who died only last Wednesday when 
his vehicle drove over a bomb in Fallujah. Tarryl Hill was just 19 
years old. He had joined the military to help finance his education to 
become a chemical engineer, but instead he became the 120th serviceman 
from Michigan to die in Iraq. I don't want to see one more promising 
life like Tarryl's extinguished on the altar of this administration's 
arrogance.

The loss of Tarryl's life brings to mind the bereavement of another 
patriot from Michigan, Lila Lipscomb of Flint, whose 26 year old son 
Michael died in Iraq in April 2003 when his helicopter was shot down. A 
member of a military family, Ms. Lipscomb initially believed President 
Bush when he told the nation that the war was necessary for our 
national security. But her son's letters from the front lines and his 
tragic death showed her that he never should have gone to Iraq.

I need not spend much time explaining my opposition to the troop 
surge, which is simply even more ''more of the same.'' This policy 
takes us in precisely the opposite direction recommended by the 
generals and the experts. It would simply expose GI's to more intense 
door-to-door fighting, in the vain hope that, in the meanwhile, the 
Iraqis will miraculously reconcile.

The real and underlying question is how we remove ourselves from this 
quagmire. As I have emphasized many times, our Constitution gives 
Congress the central role in decisions of war and peace. Last fall the 
American people spoke loudly with their votes. We should be here 
showing the voters that we heard them and that their trust in us was 
well placed.

The ultimate, unequivocal authority of the Congress is the power of 
the purse. We must use it. Supporters of the president's failed Iraq 
policy have argued that using Congress' spending power to end the war 
means that we don't ''support the troops.'' It is beyond absurd to 
suggest that those of us who favor ending funding for the war would 
simply abandon the troops in the field without the equipment and 
supplies they need. Every piece of legislation proposing cutting funds 
for combat operations would require the spending necessary to bring the 
troops home safely.

Cliches about supporting the troops are not really about our service 
members' best interests. The true purpose of these accusations is to 
distract us from the fact that we are bogged down in an unwinnable war 
with no end in sight. Keeping our troops out of harm's way, especially 
when war is unnecessary, is the best possible way to support them. The 
American people understand that marching ahead blindly into oblivion is 
no way to support our troops. That is why they have asked us to end 
this war.

Madam Speaker, the administration continues to live under the 
illusion that it can salvage its reputation by achieving a military 
victory in Iraq, when it is clear that diplomacy is the only effective 
means at our disposal. The recent National Intelligence Estimate 
reflecting the collective judgment of U.S. intelligence agencies only 
confirms what we have seen in the daily headlines for almost a year. It 
concludes that the civil war has reached an intensity that is ''self-
sustaining'' and that there are no Iraqi national leaders with the 
ability to stop it. No wonder the Administration stalled completion of 
the NIE until after the election and the President's presentation of 
his latest proposal.

Most of the American people know that there is only one way to 
proceed in Iraq. We must begin the phased withdrawal of American troops 
in the next four to six months and conclude it within the year. 
Redeploying our armed forces does not mean ''cutting and running.'' On 
the contrary, we suggest continued and extensive involvement in the 
region through renewed diplomacy, a regional conference and 
reconstruction that is free from fraud and abuse. This sensible path is 
the only one that can lead us to victory.
