Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Virginia, I am going to 
yield because I wish to allow the Senator from Michigan, if he wishes, 
to continue this colloquy. But I wish to say what the Senator from 
Virginia has said is troubling to me as an individual Senator in this 
regard. I was one of 23 Senators who voted against the authorization of 
the use of force in Iraq. I believed it was wrong. My position did not 
prevail.
