`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 15 February 2007`

---


Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are not here today, I assume, to 
debate the substance of the Iraq matter, but it is important to 
remember that both the majority leader and the majority whip in 
December were saying a surge might be a good idea, and now they are 
saying the only resolution we should have before the Senate is one 
condemning a surge. Let me repeat, that is not the way the Senate 
works.

So I would like to propose a unanimous consent request, Mr. 
President.

I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, February 27, at a time 
determined by the majority leader, after


consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed en bloc to 
the following concurrent resolutions under the following agreement: a 
concurrent resolution, if received from the House, the text of which is 
at the desk; S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution which is to be 
discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee; the McCain-Graham-
Lieberman amendment regarding benchmarks; the Gregg amendment related 
to funding.

I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 12 hours of 
debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; 
provided further, that no amendments be in order to any of the 
measures; further, that at the use or yielding back of time, the Senate 
proceed to four consecutive votes on the adoption of the concurrent 
resolutions in the following order, with no further action or 
intervening debate: first, McCain-Lieberman-Graham, then Gregg, then 
Warner.

Finally, I ask unanimous consent that any resolution that does not 
receive 60 votes in the affirmative, the vote on the adoption be 
vitiated and the concurrent resolution be returned to its previous 
status.
