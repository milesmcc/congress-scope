Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I notice my colleague doesn't spend any 
time at all talking about the rule which is being considered at this 
time and shutting down democracy which we all aspire to in Iraq and 
other places in the world.

With that, I would like to yield 4 minutes to the author of the very 
important measure that will be made in order if we are able to defeat 
the previous question, a clean supplemental, my good friend from 
Redlands, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. 
Lewis.
