Mr. DURBIN. Second longest in the history of the State of Virginia 
and who has been a constructive partner in our efforts to deal with 
this issue of Iraq. Even before other Senators on his side of the aisle 
questioned, spoke out, he was there, and I respect him very much for 
that effort.

Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia that the Levin-Reed 
amendment is conscious of the very first point he made, saying that 
even redeploying troops, we would reserve the right to use our 
soldiers, use our troops to stop the expansion of al-Qaida. So we are 
not walking away from that threat.

Al-Qaida, as the Senator from Virginia knows, were the real culprits 
on 9/11. They are the ones who are sworn enemies of the United States 
and in what we believe. I don't believe any Senator on my side, in the 
Levin-Reed amendment or otherwise, has suggested we would not continue 
to work to stop the advance of al-Qaida and its evil scheme.
