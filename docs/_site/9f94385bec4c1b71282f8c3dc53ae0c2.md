`Mr. McCARTHY of California â€” 25 September 2009`

---


Mr. McCARTHY of California. Reclaiming my time, if the President only 
slashes it in half, it's still the highest deficit that we have ever 
had.

I am one who likes to look forward. I may have only been here 3 
years, but the one thing I have seen, if you take the entire history 
since the creation of this country, there have been 44 administrations. 
If you just take the first 43, from George Washington to George Bush, 
and you add up all the amount of debt that was accumulating, and that's 
from the creation of this country to our battles with Britain, to World 
War I, to the Depression, to World War II, Katrina, Afghanistan, Iraq, 
Vietnam, Korea, the creation of a highway system, it is equal to the 
amount of debt that is going to be doubled. That is something that 
cannot be maintained. That is something that cannot be happening.

The way to get out of it, you have to control your spending and you 
have to create jobs. That's why the power of the idea needs to win at 
the end of the day.

So we will continue to come up with the ideas. We will continue to 
try to work in a bipartisan manner, and we will continue to hand them 
to you. But the only thing I ask of you is when you see something that 
would create twice as many jobs with half the cost, let's put people 
before politics, let's put America first, and let's move forward to the 
future.
