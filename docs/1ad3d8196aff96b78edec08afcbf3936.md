Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor 
Chet and Sylvia Morgan, of Vernon, Connecticut. The Morgans recently 
celebrated their golden wedding anniversary at the Rockville Elks 
Carriage House in Rockville, Connecticut.

On January 26th, 1957, Chet and Sylvia married at St. Bridget Church 
in Manchester, Connecticut. Fifty years later, Chet and Sylvia are 
still happily married, recently renewing their wedding vows at St. 
Joseph Church in Rockville.

Chet and Sylvia are the proud parents of three, grandparents of 
eight, and great-grandparents of four. One of their grandsons, Kody, is 
a Connecticut National Guardsman currently serving in Iraq. I know that 
Chet and Sylvia are especially proud of his service to our country.

On behalf of my hometown of Vernon and Connecticut's Second 
Congressional District, I congratulate the Morgans and wish them all 
the best in the years to come.
