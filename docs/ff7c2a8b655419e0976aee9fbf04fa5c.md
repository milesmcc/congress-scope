Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, we are sacrificing our entire domestic 
agenda for an illegal war in Iraq.

When you look at the President's budget, reductions in education and 
health care over a period of time will cause many necessary programs to 
be cut for the American people. Meanwhile, the White House is 
discussing whether or not to bring refugees from Iraq to the United 
States.

Now, think about it a minute. We are prosecuting an illegal war in 
Iraq, we are illegally occupying the country, we are building permanent 
bases in Iraq, and now we are talking about bringing refugees here. The 
real humanitarian thing to do would be to end the war by ending the 
occupation, closing the bases and bringing our troops home.

That is exactly what my 12-point plan would do. I reached it with the 
help of people from the international community, the U.N., people who 
have experience in peacekeeping. They say we can bring in an 
international security force once we get agreement from the countries 
in the region, and we can bring our troops home.

We have to stop this disaster in Iraq, bring our troops home, end the 
occupation.
