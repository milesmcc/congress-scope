Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, today I am reintroducing the Federal 
Employee Combat Zone Tax Parity Act, which would provide parity by 
extending the tax credit currently received by military personnel to 
the civilian federal employees working alongside them.

It is only fair that both military and civilian employees who are 
serving side by side receive the same tax treatment. In fact, even 
contract employees can get a tax break through the foreign earned 
investment tax credit, but federal employees are specifically exempted 
from that tax credit.

As a former federal employee, I am keenly aware of the invaluable 
contributions federal employees make to our country. I believe we must 
ensure that our federal workforce is treated with fairness and respect.

The Pentagon stated in the proposed regulations for the new National 
Security Personnel System that ''NSPS is essential to the department's 
efforts to create an environment in which the total force, uniformed 
personnel and civilians, think and operates as one cohesive unit.'' 
What kind of message does it send to civilian employees if they receive 
disparate tax status from their military colleagues?

Just as military personnel, federal employees serving in combat zones 
must leave their families behind and this can increase the financial 
burdens on families. Families with two working parents suddenly have 
only one parent able to care for the needs of the family. Military 
personnel in combat zones were given a tax credit back in 1913 to help 
alleviate their tax burden, but federal employees were left out.

Since 9/11 it has become ever more vital to have a thriving civil 
service participating in our efforts to fight the war on terrorism. Now 
more than ever in our nation's history we must take action that 
reflects the contributions both our civilian and military employees are 
making--in the war on terrorism and as well as the daily operations of 
the federal government in providing the services upon which every 
American relies.

Federal employees are on the front lines of the war against terror.

The first American to die in Afghanistan was a CIA agent from my 
district.

Federal employees are in Iraq helping the Iraqi people to build a 
free nation.

Throughout the world, America's civil servants are serving our 
government and our people, often in dangerous locations.

How can we tell them we will not give them a fair and equitable tax 
credit that recognizes their hard work, dedication, and sacrifice?

We are asking federal employees to take on more and more 
responsibility every day. They are on the ground in the war on 
terrorism taking over new roles to relieve military personnel of tasks 
civilian employees can perform. They are all playing a vital role in 
keeping us safe and deserve to be treated with respect and fairness.

We have a long tradition in the Congress of recognizing the valuable 
contributions of our federal employees in both the military service and 
in the civil service by providing fair and equitable treatment. This is 
not the time to shirk our duty to the civil service.

I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Federal Employee 
Combat Zone Tax Parity Act.
