`Mr. GRAHAM â€” 10 July 2007`

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to retired 
Colonel Michael Wayne Butler. On June 12, 2007, South Carolina lost a 
true patriot when Colonel Butler was killed while working for a 
contractor near Tikrit, Iraq. He is survived by his wife Joanne, sons 
Mike and Daniel, and grandson Da'Kori.

Colonel Butler's career in the Air Force began when he graduated from 
the U.S. Air Academy in 1976. Upon graduation, Colonel Butler was 
commissioned an aircraft maintenance officer. Colonel Butler's career 
in the Air Force was nothing less than distinguished. He had the 
opportunity to command the 50th Component Repair Squadron at Hahn AB, 
Germany, and later the 39th Logistics Group at Incirlik AB, Turkey. In 
many ways, Colonel Butler's final tour was one of his most complicated 
ones. Responsible for developing contingency plans and conducting air 
operations in a 25-nation area of responsibility covering a large swath 
of the globe, Colonel Butler served as CENTAF Director of Logistics at 
Shaw AFB in South Carolina. After 30 years of distinguished military 
service, earning a Bronze Star, a Meritorious Service Medal with six 
oak leaf clusters, and an Air Force Commendation Medal, Colonel Butler 
took a much deserved retirement from the Air Force in 2006.

Continuing his love of travel, Colonel Butler trekked around the 
world with his wife after retiring. Though Colonel Butler would soon be 
pursuing a new calling, the Butlers established a home in Rembert, SC. 
In December of 2006, Colonel Butler joined DynCorp International to be 
the senior deputy program manager for CIVPOL. His new occupation sent 
him to Iraq. Colonel Butler's experience in the region and his 
dedication to the cause of freedom was surely an asset in his new 
duties. On his final mission to advance our cause in Iraq, Colonel 
Butler was transporting prisoners in a five-vehicle convoy with the 
U.S. military and Iraqi police when his vehicle was hit by an IED and 
small arms fire. Colonel Butler and one American soldier lost their 
lives.

Colonel Butler's love of life extended beyond the battlefield. An 
avid runner, Colonel Butler competed in and completed the Marine Corps 
Marathon. Completing the marathon once is quite an accomplishment, but 
Colonel Butler embraced the challenge of the marathon and completed it 
multiple times. I was moved to hear that his family will run the 
marathon in Colonel Butler's absence this year.

Colonel Butler will be buried at Arlington Cemetery on August 22 with 
full honors. As he departs on his final mission, his memory and legacy 
will not fade from the hearts and minds of all of the people he came 
across in his life. He will be missed but this Nation will never 
forget.
