Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Caribbean 
American Heritage Month. The imprint of Caribbean-Americans on the 
foundation of the United States is indispensable. This June, we 
Americans have the opportunity to celebrate the history, 
accomplishments, culture and global influence of people of Caribbean 
descent past and present.

Caribbean-Americans have significantly contributed to the ethnic 
diversity that strengthens and enhances our stature in the 
international community. From the platform of St. Mark's Church in New 
York City to the halls of Congress, Caribbean-Americans such as Marcus 
Garvey and Congresswoman Barbara Lee have effected the civil rights and 
federal legislation that serve as building blocks in American history.

Even in times of war, Caribbean-Americans support our efforts at home 
and abroad by serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Today, thousands of 
Caribbean-Americans are fighting to achieve stability in Iraq.

In a wide variety of fields, people of Caribbean descent have 
transformed the Nation we live in today. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in support of H. Con. Res. 148, recognizing the significance of 
National Caribbean-American Heritage Month.
