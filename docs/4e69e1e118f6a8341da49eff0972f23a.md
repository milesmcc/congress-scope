Mr. CORNYN. I have 1 minute remaining?

Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Arizona, of course. My 
belief would be that if our friends on the other side of the aisle 
wanted to move up the cloture vote on the Levin amendment to 6 p.m. 
tonight, we could expedite things and get right to the vote that 
perhaps the distinguished majority whip wishes to have. I think there 
is no objection on this side to providing a vote on that cloture vote. 
We could do that sooner rather than later. I certainly would support 
that action. I will have to consult with the leaders on this side of 
the aisle, but that certainly might help us get to the bottom of things 
that much sooner.

I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment before 
us that would be a vote against any action that would enhance the 
likelihood of a failed state in Iraq, which is not in America's best 
security interests.

I ask for the yeas and nays.
