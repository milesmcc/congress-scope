Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have made some good progress on the 
bill today. A number of our colleagues have come forward. I 
particularly wanted to thank Senator Feingold for coming and debating 
his amendment on prioritization with me. We are going to have a vote on 
that, if all goes well, on Tuesday. That has not been finalized, but it 
looks as if that is what is going to happen.

I would say to colleagues that we did have a good, fair debate so far 
today, and we are going to continue this tomorrow and on Monday. I hope 
that those who have not come forward with their amendments would be so 
kind as to do that. We don't have very many because we did take care of 
many issues between both sides of the committee, but if there are 
amendments, we urge our colleagues to please come forward and talk 
about those amendments. This way, they can have as much time as they 
want and we can hopefully get this bill done.

We keep adding to the letters of support. I was just handed a letter 
from the National Association of Manufacturers in favor of this bill, 
so it is one of these rare moments in history where we have the 
manufacturers association, the labor unions, we have the farmers, we 
have the corn growers, and we have the water people. We just have a 
huge amount of support for this bill. It is one of those times that 
everybody is coming together, setting aside other matters, other issues 
that are so terribly contentious, such as Iraq, which tears at our 
heartstrings whenever we are on it, and other tough matters we deal 
with every day. This is one which does bring us together, I am happy to 
say.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter I just 
referred to printed in the Record.
