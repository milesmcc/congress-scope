Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Captain Todd M. 
Siebert, a Marine who was killed while on active duty in Iraq on 
February 16, 2007. As a member of the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Marines, 
he was on patrol in Al Anbar Province when his armored military vehicle 
was hit with an unidentified explosive device. A veteran of 
Afghanistan, he had served only six weeks in Iraq and was expecting his 
35th birthday next month.

Captain Siebert was born and raised in Franklin Park, Pennsylvania 
and graduated from North Allegheny High School. He joined the Junior 
Reserve Officer Training Corps program while in high school and 
enlisted in the Army soon after he graduated. He later joined the 
Marines and received his commission from the Marine Corps in 1999 when 
he graduated from Penn State University with a degree in criminal 
justice.

Captain Seibert was awarded the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine 
Corps Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, 
and numerous other military awards for his service to our country. He 
will be remembered for his bravery and dedication.

On behalf of my family, the Fourth Congressional District of 
Pennsylvania, and the U.S. House of Representatives, I extend our 
heartfelt sympathy and eternal gratitude to Captain Siebert's family. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Darcy, two young children, 
Alicia and Nicholas, as well as two sisters, a brother, and his 
parents, Thomas and Dorothy Siebert.
