Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, 2007 has been the deadliest year for 
American troops in Iraq. No doubt that a change of direction is needed, 
but President Bush refuses to change course. He envisions a world where 
our troops will still be on the ground in Iraq 10 years from now.

This Democratic Congress rejects such a plan. And this week we will 
once again consider legislation that will require President Bush to 
redeploy our troops out of Iraq while providing our troops in harm's 
way with the resources that they need.

President Bush has asked Congress for an additional $200 billion for 
Iraq. This House will instead vote on a $50 billion package that will 
require the immediate start of the redeployment of U.S. forces out of 
Iraq. The legislation sets a goal of having nearly every troop out of 
Iraq by the end of next year. That is a significant change in the 
course of the war, and it is a change that will finally hold Iraq 
accountable for its future course.

Madam Speaker, this Congress will continue to fight to change 
President Bush's 10-year, trillion-dollar war. We are committed to 
bringing our troops home soon, repairing the readiness of our military, 
and refocusing our efforts to fight terrorism around the world.
