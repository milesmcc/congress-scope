Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on the previous motion to 
recommit vote, in light of the new extraordinary and difficult and 
strenuous voting time, I was unavoidably delayed in an Iraq briefing. 
If I was present, I would have voted ''nay'' on the motion to recommit 
on the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill.
