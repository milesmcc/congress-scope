`Mr. SANDERS â€” 19 December 2007`

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, last night I indicated my strong concerns 
about the omnibus appropriations bill, a bill that I expected to 
include all domestic spending as well as funding for the war in Iraq. 
Notably, I discussed my grave misgivings about funding for the 
President's disastrous, ongoing and ill-conceived war. I also raised my 
unease with last-minute additions of loan guarantees for questionable 
energy sources, such as the building of new nuclear power and for coal-
related energy, especially coal to liquids.

Last night, I voted against an amendment to provide the President 
with a blank check for his war. Until even later in the evening, I 
thought that the war funding would be attached to the domestic spending 
legislation set for vote that evening. However, it was clear by the 
time of the domestic spending vote that the Iraq war funds were kept 
separate. I remain very concerned with the nuclear and coal loan 
guarantees that were inserted, I decided that, on balance, the domestic 
spending bill that would fund, among other important priorities, 
community health centers and health care for many Americans in need, 
deserved my support. I regret the insertion of the ill-conceived loan 
guarantees and will work with my colleagues to address them.
