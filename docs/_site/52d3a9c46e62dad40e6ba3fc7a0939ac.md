Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Madam Speaker, Sgt. First Class Floyd Everett Lake 
was a courageous, dedicated and committed soldier who died on January 
20, 2007 when the Blackhawk helicopter in which he was riding with 
fellow Virgin Islands soldier, Lt. Col. David C. Canegata III and ten 
other brave Americans was shot down over Baghdad, Iraq. Soldiers 
Canegata and Lake served together in the Virgin Islands National Guard, 
and at the Pentagon at the National Guard Bureau.

He was an exemplary soldier who cared for his family and his 
community and he served his country with distinction. He was said to be 
quiet and plainspoken, honest and forthright, caring, gentle and 
generous. In a single moment he was taken from his family, from his 
wife, Linda, mother, Mrs. Buchanan, children Andre, Keeshawn, Floyd, 
Jr., J'Nell, Tamila, his mother-in-law Junie and sisters and brothers 
Patricia, Bernadette, Cheryl, Odette, Zelda, Earl, and Asbert, many 
friends and his National Guard family.

The Gospel of John, Chapter 15, Verse 13 states that ''Greater love 
than this has no man, but that he lay down his life for his friends.'' 
SFC Lake and his comrades have done just that.

God lent us a wonderful gift in the life of SFC Lake. He now returns 
to his loving embrace.

We honor him and thank him for his sacrifice. May he rest in God's 
eternal peace.
