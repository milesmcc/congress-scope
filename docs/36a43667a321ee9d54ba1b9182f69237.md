Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I just want to take this opportunity, it is 
an excellent segue that the doctor made. While the President finds it 
repugnant to have $35 billion in new moneys over 5 years, which would 
be what SCHIP calls for, the President in his new Iraq war supplement 
asks for an additional $45 billion, totaling close to $200 billion for 
the war in Iraq for the next year. That is $200 billion for the next 
year. And we can't afford a $7 billion increase for our children to get 
health care?

So please keep in this mind that this compromise to reauthorize SCHIP 
is something very small in comparison to the values that he seems to 
hold dear, which is waging war, in a war that we never should have been 
in, based on a false premise. For that he is willing to give all. But 
to secure the national health of our children, no money for that.
