Mr. REYES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, on December 30, while many of us were watching 
football, traveling back from holiday visits with our families, or 
preparing to usher in the new year with loved ones, seven members of 
the Central Intelligence Agency family had their lives cut short in an 
attack on Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. This 
was the deadliest day for the CIA since the bombing of the Beirut 
Embassy in 1983.

The news of this tragic loss was of particular personal sadness and 
difficulty for me. I had the privilege to meet the Khost team when I 
last visited Afghanistan on a committee oversight trip. I can attest 
that these men and women were among the finest America has to offer. 
They did not shy from the dangers they knew existed, and they believed 
in the mission they were asked to perform. They worked tirelessly in an 
environment that is always dangerous. I am proud of the work that they 
did and the work that their colleagues continue to do today to keep our 
country safe.

The officers who died in Khost were true professionals. They were 
savvy officers who relied on years of experience to make judgments and 
to calculate risk. These men and women were deployed to an area of 
great danger and hardship, and they did so knowing that the worst could 
happen. But, they did it anyway, because we as a Nation are relying on 
them and colleagues like them to make the United States safe from the 
threat of terrorism.

I realize that many people have a distorted vision of what it means 
to be part of the CIA family. Movies and books have made the life of a 
CIA officer seem exciting. It wasn't until I


joined the Intelligence Committee that I fully understood the unique 
sacrifices that the men and women of the CIA and their families are 
willing to make in service to our Nation. In addition to the inherent 
dangers of the job, there are long separations from family and loved 
ones, often without explanation and on very short notice. Birthdays and 
holidays are spent in foreign corners of the world.

To those who were wounded in the attack, let me just add my personal 
thanks for your service and wish you a full and speedy recovery.

To the families of those who lost their lives on December 30, you 
have our deepest appreciation and gratitude. In this time of grief, 
please know that you are in our prayers and that this tragic loss will 
never be forgotten. It is my hope that you can find solace in the 
selfless, quiet devotion that these brave men and women gave for the 
safety and protection of our great Nation. They made the ultimate 
sacrifice on behalf of all of us. And all Americans owe them, and you, 
a great debt for their commitment and dedication to a job that very 
rarely receives any kind of public recognition.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
