Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 959, which offers 
financial assistance for higher education to the children of police 
officers, firefighters, and other first responders who made the 
ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

Madam Speaker, it is an American responsibility to look after the 
children of our fallen heroes. A small but important gesture to 
fulfilling this commitment is to make a college education possible for 
the children who have lost a parent in the line of duty. These mothers 
and fathers have given their lives so that we might be safe. We should 
do all that we can to help their sons and daughters be successful.

We know that the loss of a parent can make it difficult for families 
to make ends meet, let alone send their kids to college. Making their 
children eligible for the maximum Pell Grant is the way to thank the 
officers for their sacrifice and to give their children an education 
which they might not otherwise be able to afford.

Under this bill, a child of a fallen police officer, firefighter, or 
other first responder who is eligible for a Pell Grant would become 
automatically eligible for the maximum Pell award. This legislation 
would waive the income eligibility requirements in such cases.

With passage of the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act, we 
expanded Pell Grants to survivors of soldiers killed in Iraq and 
Afghanistan in a similar manner. As a result, these children will be 
eligible for more than $20,000 in grants for college over 4 years.

Whether it's a sacrifice made on a distant battlefield or protecting 
our citizens here at home, it's time we extended this benefit to all of 
the children of our fallen heroes. Our fallen heroes deserve our thanks 
and they deserve our respect, and we can honor them by supporting their 
children as they seek out a higher education.

I ask that my colleagues join me in full support of H.R. 959, and to 
take a moment to appreciate the daily sacrifices made by America's 
police officers, firefighters, and first responders.

I want to thank Representative Murphy for bringing this resolution to 
the floor, and I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution.

I also want to thank Chairman Conyers of the Judiciary Committee for 
working with the Education and Labor


Committee on allowing this bill to move expeditiously to the floor.





















 House of Representatives,



















 Committee on the Judiciary,



















 Washington, DC, May 10, 2010.


 Hon. George Miller,


 Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, House of 




 Representatives, Washington, DC.



 Dear Chairman Miller: In recognition of the desire to 


 expedite consideration of H.R. 959, the Officer Daniel 


 Faulkner Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act of 2010, 


 the Committee on the Judiciary agrees to waive formal 


 consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall within 


 its rule X jurisdiction.



 The Committee takes this action with our mutual 


 understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 959 at 


 this time, it does not waive any jurisdiction over subject 


 matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our 


 Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as the 


 bill or similar legislation moves forward, so that we may 


 address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. The 


 Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an 


 appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate 


 conference involving this or similar legislation, and 


 requests your support for any such request.



 I would appreciate your including this letter in the 


 Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the 


 House floor.



 Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for the 


 cooperative working relationship between our two committees.





 Sincerely,
























John Conyers, Jr.,


 Chairman.
