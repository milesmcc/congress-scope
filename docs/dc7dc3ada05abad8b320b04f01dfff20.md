`Mr. ENGEL â€” 17 October 2007`

Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, among the many of our men and women who 
serve in Iraq are the Nurse Corps Officers who treat the ill and the 
wounded, giving sustenance while saving lives.

Lt. Col. Pedro Altiery is one such member of that Corps whose 
exceptionally meritorious service earned him the Bronze Star for his 
service during Operation Iraqi Freedom from March, 2005 to May, 2006.

He was described as one of the best Nurse Corps Officers who ensured 
the highest standards were kept in operating rooms and in providing 
quality care to the detainee population. He developed a highly 
organized, professional and clinically excellent team which could be 
called on in a moment's notice to be fully operational.



He set the tone for his team with his enthusiastic leadership. He 
wrote detailed Standards of Operating Procedure that are still used 
today and will be for the duration of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

I salute the great work done by Lt. Col. Altiery under exhausting 
conditions while maintaining his extraordinary technical skill and 
expertise. As well as thank him for his meritorious service to our 
country.
