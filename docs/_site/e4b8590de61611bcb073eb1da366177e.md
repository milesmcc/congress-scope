Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If you look on every issue, right, it is like we 
get hit on 9/11, the Taliban is housing them in Afghanistan, somehow we 
end up in Iraq. We have an energy problem. Drilling is up 67 percent. 
We have all this land and everything else, all these other areas. We 
got to keep drilling. That is the answer, when we know that it is these 
other things going on in the commodities market.

We look at trying to reduce the cost of college education. It is like 
we will put the banks in charge of loaning the money to the kids. Or if 
we want to provide prescription drugs, I got an idea. We will have the 
taxpayer pay for it, and we won't do any negotiations with the drug 
companies at all.

It is like they have a solution that doesn't address the current 
problem that we have at hand, Mr. Speaker. And what we are trying to 
say is we have solutions that will last more than a decade or two, and 
if they are wrong, we will switch them. But to come down and say drill, 
drill, drill, drill, drill. In ANWR, for example, it will reduce the 
cost of a gallon of gas by 1.8 cents per gallon of gas 20 years from 
now if we start drilling today. Totally off the mark.
