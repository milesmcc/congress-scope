Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise with great pleasure to honor a 
visionary, diplomat, activist, and advocate for peace on the occasion 
of her receipt of the 2008 Jack Green Civil Liberties Award by the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Sonoma County. Elizabeth Stinson's 
work with the Peace and Justice Center of Sonoma County and her 
lifetime dedication to human rights have left an enduring legacy.

In 2001, after several years work with the United Nations, where she 
still retains a position with the UN's International Indigenous Forum, 
Elizabeth became director of the Peace and Justice Center, helping 
those Sonoma County residents who are victims of our Nation's most 
challenging conflicts.

In Santa Rosa, for example, Elizabeth has mediated inter-gang 
disputes while leading campaigns to end escalating local violence. In 
2002, recognizing the need to provide youth with nonviolent choices, 
she founded the High School Outreach Peace Education, or HOPE, project 
to educate them about their rights as students, their rights regarding 
the military, and service learning and internship opportunities.

In addition, through Elizabeth's coordination with courts in three 
counties, the Peace and Justice Center was established as an authorized 
diversion program provider for convicted and at-risk teens and young 
adults.

Under her direction, the Peace and Justice Center has also gained 
national attention for supporting troops who need a military separation 
for reasons such as untreated combat-related trauma, repeated 
deployments, recruiter misrepresentations, and other compelling mental 
and physical issues. Since the beginning of the occupation of Iraq 5 
years ago, Elizabeth and her team of volunteers at the


center have successfully negotiated 850 administrative discharges.

Elizabeth's work continues to have national effect as she provides 
counseling support to troops testifying at the Winter Soldier hearings 
in D.C. At an upcoming GI national retreat, she will conduct training 
on post-traumatic stress for hotline counselors.

Aside from her lifelong international work for human rights, 
Elizabeth is mother to three adult children and Sanctuary Mom to five, 
whose father was executed by death squads after helping to found El 
Salvador's Human Rights Commission.

Madam Speaker, Elizabeth's commitment to the rights of the vulnerable 
has rightly earned her the 2008 Jack Green Civil Liberties Award. I am 
honored to have Elizabeth Stinson as my constituent. I commend her for 
her work and for the well-deserved award being bestowed on her by the 
ACLU of Sonoma County.
