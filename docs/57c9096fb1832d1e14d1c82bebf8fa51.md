Mr. LOEBSACK. I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 3159, of 
which I'm a proud cosponsor.

I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California and the 
chairman of the Armed Services Committee for their leadership on this 
issue.

Just 14 months after returning from deployment in support of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 833rd Engineer Company of the Iowa Army 
National Guard was again mobilized for combat duty in Iraq. The men and 
women of the 833rd have served with distinction. Yet, by providing 
inadequate and unpredictable rest between deployments, the Bush 
administration has broken our contract with our citizen soldiers. We 
have strained our troops, endangering both our men and women in uniform 
and our national security.

Our servicemembers must have the dwell time necessary to be fully 
rested, trained and equipped. This bill provides the rest and 
predictability necessary to ensure the health of our Armed Forces, and 
I strongly urge its passage.
