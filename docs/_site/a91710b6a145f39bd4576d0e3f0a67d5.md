`Mr. WARNER â€” 31 January 2007`

---


Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished colleague from Maine. I share 
her views, as I expressed them with our leader here, that it was 
certainly always the intention of the Senator from Virginia that this 
matter should be kept in a resolution status, thereby precluding any 
necessity for the President to become involved in the sense of a 
legislative process. I feel confident that what we have put forth are 
recommendations--not orders to the President, not contravening the 
President's constitutional authority in any way, but they are the 
heartfelt thoughts of Senators as to how there could be further 
modifications in the new strategy in such a way as to hopefully lower 
the profile of the United States Armed Forces in the Baghdad operation 
and, thereby, hopefully, wherever possible, not inject them into this 
sectarian violence which can be better handled by the Iraqis, who 
understand the Iraqis, who have a far better understanding of the 
cultural differences that give rise to so much of this sectarian strife 
today. I am optimistic that can come to pass and we can treat this in 
the resolution status and that Senators can work their free will. There 
may be ideas far better than what I have embraced in this resolution, 
together with my colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Ben Nelson. We 
are open to ideas. It is best that those ideas be exhibited right here 
on the Senate floor in full view of all to determine their merit.

I thank my colleague. I am honored the Senator sees fit to join us as 
a cosponsor.
