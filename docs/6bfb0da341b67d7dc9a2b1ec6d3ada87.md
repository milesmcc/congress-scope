Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor SFC James Doster of 
White Hall, AR, who died on September 29, 2007, fighting for our 
country in Iraq while supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was 38 
years old when he selflessly gave his life for his country during 
combat operations in Iraq.

Sergeant First Class Doster graduated from White Hall High School 
before attending Hendrix College. While in college, his deep sense of 
unity and teamwork led him to join the United States Army and honorably 
serve his country. Although he was a quiet man, everyone who had the 
privilege to meet and know him was immediately made aware that he had a 
big heart and could see how much he cared for all those around him. He 
was a dedicated family man who was always there for his family--
especially his two daughters, whom he adored.

Sergeant First Class Doster joined the Army in 1990, and his proud 
service will continue to live on and serve as an inspiration to the 
many soldiers who knew him and fought alongside him in combat. He 
served in the 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry 
Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, based at Fort Riley, 
Kansas. His bravery, courage and dedication to the Army are exemplified 
by his 17 years of service. He believed so deeply in the Army that he 
also served as a recruiter helping others gain the passion and sense of 
camaraderie, service and love of his country that he possessed.

SFC James Doster will forever be remembered as a hero, a son, a 
father and a husband. My deepest condolences go out to his wife, Amanda 
Doster; his two daughters, Kathryn and Grace; his mother, Billie 
Doster; and his brother, Rob Doster. He will be missed by his family, 
his community, his country and all those who knew him. I honor Sergeant 
First Class Doster for his bravery, his patriotism and his service and 
I will continue to keep his family in my deepest thoughts and prayers.
