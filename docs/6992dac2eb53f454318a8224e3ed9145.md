Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, you know, it is time for the Democrat 
Party to lay out its plan for Iraq. I understand the echo chamber of 
liberalism is going to be teeing off on the President all week long. I 
understand that, because that is what has been going on for 6 months 
and, indeed, in some circles for a year.

There are 65 Members, in fact, of the Get Out of Iraq Now Caucus, and 
I actually have a lot of respect for them because they have a vision, 
they have a plan. The plan is: get out of Iraq.

Now there is no answer to the question: What happens then? What 
happens then when you have an American defeat internationally in the 
Middle East, when you turn over the third largest oil producing nation 
in the world to a terrorist state? What happens to the people over 
there who are pro-America or pro-democracy? They don't answer that 
question, and I understand that.

But for the other Democrats who are so enthusiastically piling on the 
President right now, and certainly I want to say as a Republican it has 
not been going well and we do need a new change in direction, but I 
would say to the majority party, put your plan on the table.
