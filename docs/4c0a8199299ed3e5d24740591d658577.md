Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, once again, we have a vivid, vivid 
example of this President's misplaced priorities. Earlier this month, 
the President vetoed the Children's Health Insurance Program, which 
would have extended private health insurance coverage to 10 million 
children in this country at a reasonable investment of $35 billion over 
a 5-year period. It costs too much, the President said. We can't afford 
it. Yet, last week the President requested additional funding for this 
misadventure in Iraq to the tune of $189 billion. We can't find money 
for children and health care in this country, but we can find, 
apparently, endless supplies of dollars to fund the war in Iraq.

Madam Speaker, this President on this issue and on many other issues 
is gravely out of touch with the American people.
