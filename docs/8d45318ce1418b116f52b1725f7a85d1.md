Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to speak about an 
issue that is very close to my heart personally as a father and 
American and as a Member of Congress. There is a plague across this 
Nation that has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of American 
citizens, and it is disturbing and upsetting that there is no public 
outcry over the destruction that it leaves in its path. The plague is 
urban violence.

Mr. Speaker, over the Christmas break I was shocked by a piece of 
news that I saw on ''Nightline'' which detailed how medics who are sent 
to Iraq are honing their skills by working in urban hospitals attending 
to gunshot victims.

The documentary went on to say that over 75 African American and 
Latino males are killed in our inner cities on a daily basis. Over 75 
Latinos and American males are killed on a daily basis in American 
streets, a number that dwarfs the number of fatalities, Iraqi and 
American, that are suffered in the war zone.

Mr. Speaker, we must break this silence and stop this violence. It is 
time to stop the killing, stop the violence.
