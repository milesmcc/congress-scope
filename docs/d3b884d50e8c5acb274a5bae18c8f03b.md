Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage of a 
brave and dedicated hero of the Fort Worth community and of our Nation.

PFC Joshua G. Romero was a proud United States Army soldier and a 
true American hero who gallantly gave his life for his country on May 
18, 2007, during combat operations in Tahrir, Iraq.

Assigned to the First Cavalry Division of Fort Hood, Texas, Joshua 
enlisted during time of war, which speaks volumes about his character, 
bravery, and clear sense of patriotism.

Joshua is survived by his wife, son, father, mother, step-mother, and 
all of his sisters and brothers.

Our thoughts and prayers are with them and all his family and 
friends.

Our community and Nation honor Joshua's memory and we are grateful 
for his faithful and noble service to our country.

PFC Joshua G. Romero will never be forgotten. His memory lives on 
through his family and the legacy of selfless service that he so 
bravely imprinted on our hearts.
