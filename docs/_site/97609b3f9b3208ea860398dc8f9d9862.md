Mr. GOHMERT. I thank you for that observation.

That's exactly right. Some people will not be able to put money into 
the Health Savings Accounts, and those will be people we will be able 
to help as the Federal Government, and it will be cheaper to do that 
than to keep going bankrupt, which is where we're going. The projection 
is, by 2017-2018, we're going to bankrupt America with Medicare. Why 
wouldn't you try to do something to rein that in?

Let me just say I disagree with what the President has done. I've 
been in the Army. I've seen how commanders agonize, and I know General 
McChrystal was handpicked. He went over there. He gave the President 
his assessment. We really need at least 40,000 troops. It's very plain. 
You either put them in there or we're going to lose this war. Now, to 
me, that seems like that ought not to require more than 72 hours once 
you get that general's report. My goodness.


He says, The guy I handpicked, if we don't give him 40,000 troops 
quick, then we're going to lose the war.

That's very clear. He didn't take 72 hours. He is taking 60 days or 
more and counting. We've got 60,000, 70,000 troops or so over in 
Afghanistan who are waiting with bated breath to know what the 
President is going to do, and so are we.

This bill here will affect over 300 million people's lives and the 
lives of generations to come. We don't get the 60 days that the 
President has taken to make sure he gets it right. We're told we get 72 
hours. You're not going to have time to find all the pitfalls that 
we've put in there. We're talking about the future of this country and 
about future generations. They are owed so much better, not because 
they've done anything to deserve it, not because we've done anything to 
deserve the blessings that have been heaped upon us, but because those 
who went before us made the sacrifice of life--of their fortunes, of 
their sacred honor--and that's why we reap the benefits we do. We owe 
it to future generations because of what the past generations have done 
for us, and that is what we have to do.

It breaks my heart to close out this congressional session. We're 
going home, and the President will make a lot of appearances, and so 
will Speaker Pelosi. The American people are the ones who are going to 
get hurt, and the children of the future will get hurt.

Oh, yeah. Congresswoman Capps is a very gracious, delightful Member 
of Congress, but the Capps amendment is in there, so this type of 
public option will be able to fund abortions. I mean this stuff is 
here. We need more than 72 hours. We need at least as much as the 
President is taking to review Afghanistan.

Mr. Speaker, with that, I know my time has run out, so I yield back 
at this time.
