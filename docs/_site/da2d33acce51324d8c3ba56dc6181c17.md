Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again wish to address the amendment I 
have put forward together with Senator Collins. I realize there is a 
provision in here with regard to a waiver, and that relates to the 
President's ability to redirect funds that are nonmilitary. But I say 
to my colleagues that while that particular section of this bill was 
amended at the last minute, the other sections absolutely remain strong 
and essential to keep this body informed; namely, the two independent 
studies, one to be performed by retired military with respect to the 
proficiency, capability, professional abilities of the Iraqi security 
forces; and, secondly, the one that requires the General Accounting 
Office to give an opinion with regard to the compliance or 
noncompliance of benchmarks.

So in this amendment, yes, I still think there is a lot of strength 
and validity to the provisions regarding the restriction of funds to be 
expended by our Government in terms of the nonmilitary spending. The 
other portions of this bill remain strong and should earn the support 
of all colleagues who wish to be kept advised of this ever-changing 
situation.

I yield the floor.
