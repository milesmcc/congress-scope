Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Altmire. And thank you for 
really making America's military, veterans as well as the troops 
currently serving, a high priority for yourself and your agenda and the 
issues that you champion on behalf of the people in the district that 
you represent in Pennsylvania.

I want to turn now to another Pennsylvanian who served in the United 
States Navy for 31 years and rose to the rank of three star Admiral. 
His battle group conducted combat operations in Afghanistan and 
precursor operations to the war in Iraq, and he is one of our caucus' 
foremost experts on the issues that are important to military families 
and that are important to us as we try to wrestle with this very 
difficult issue of how we're going to extricate ourselves from this war 
in Iraq. And our caucus has tremendous respect for your service. And 
it's my pleasure to yield to Congressman Joe Sestak.
