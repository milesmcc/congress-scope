Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage of one 
of the bravest and most dedicated heroes of the Fort Worth community 
and of our Nation.

Sergeant First Class Allen Mosteiro was an 18-year veteran of the 
Army who was assigned as a scout leader in the first cavalry division 
based at Fort Hood, Texas.

He gallantly and selflessly gave his life for his Country as a result 
of wounds he received during a firefight in Taji, Iraq on February 13, 
2007.

Sergeant Mosteiro is survived by his wife, son, parents, one brother 
and three sisters.

As a career soldier and senior non-commissioned officer, Sergeant 
Mosteiro's leadership was instrumental in developing younger soldiers 
and he did not take this responsibility lightly.

Sergeant First Class Mosteiro is gone, but he will never be 
forgotten. His memory lives on through the family he left behind and in 
the soldiers that he so ably led.



Our community and Nation honor Sergeant First Class Mosteiro's memory 
and we are grateful for his 18 years of faithful and distinguished 
service to America.
