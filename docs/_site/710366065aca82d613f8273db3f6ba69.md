Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation which 
sets into law two very important and straightforward policies:

(1) Congress shall provide no funding to support a permanent military 
presence in Iraq; and

(2) Congress will not support any policy to exercise U.S. control of 
Iraq's oil reserves.

These policies are important because they deliver a clear message to 
the Iraqi people that the U.S. presence is not open-ended, and that the 
resources of Iraq belong to the Iraqi people.

Today, fully 80 percent of Iraqis believe the U.S. intends to remain 
indefinitely in their country. This fuels insurgent attacks against our 
troops and discourages Iraqi security forces from taking control of 
their communities.

Terrorists use the claim that the U.S. ''occupation'' is a ploy to 
steal the region's oil, and with it its economic future.

This bill helps to eliminate the deep suspicions which exist and they 
take an important step forward to change the direction of the Iraq war.

I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
