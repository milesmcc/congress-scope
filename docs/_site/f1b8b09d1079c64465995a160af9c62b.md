Mrs. KIRKPATRICK of Arizona. Madam Speaker, as a member of the House 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to have been an early co-
sponsor of the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency 
Act--a landmark piece of legislation which would require Congress to 
approve the Department of Veterans Affairs health care budget one year 
in advance.



 Imagine being the sole breadwinner in your house and not knowing 
your annual salary until well after that year started. As you are 
forced each year to guess, you might alternate between underspending 
and overspending, between scrimping and splurging.

 Now imagine that rather than the head of a small family, you were 
the VA.

 The VA--despite its size and its undeniably important mission to 
fulfill our Nation's most sacred promise--has received its 
appropriation after the start of the fiscal year in 18 out of the last 
21 years, including, now, this fiscal year.

 The VA employs well over 250,000 staff nationwide, with more than 
222,000 of those employees directly supporting the VA's health care 
system serving 5.6 million unique patients. Last year, the Veterans 
Health Administration spent approximately $43.5 billion on medical care 
and research. These numbers make the VA the second largest agency in 
the federal government after the Department of Defense, and make the 
VHA both the Nation's largest health care delivery system as well as 
its largest provider of health care education and training.

 The late appropriations and insufficient budgets have meant 
restricted access for many Veterans. When funding is short, late, or 
unpredictable, it is our Veterans who pay the price.

 Veterans in Greater Arizona are keenly aware that we need more 
medical facilities and the claims backlog is keeping many Veterans from 
the benefits they have earned. But once inside the VHA, there is no 
denying that the quality of service is very good. Numerous third party 
sources, including both the New England Journal of Medicine and Annals 
of Medicine, have concluded that the quality of care in the VA health 
care system is among the best available publicly or privately in the 
Nation.

 However, its sheer size has amplified the problems stemming from 
late appropriations, which lead to rationed care, waiting lists and 
Veterans being turned away from service.

 As Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans return and Veterans from prior 
conflicts continue to age, the number of those who need care will only 
increase, and the situation will become more critical.

 It is heartening, then, that those who support the Veterans Health 
Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act are also increasing in number. 
General Eric Shinseki, voiced his support for advance appropriations 
shortly after becoming the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The American 
Federation of Government Employees, which represents many of the 
federal employees who work for the VA, also supports the bill, as does 
the Partnership for Veterans Health Care Budget Reform--a coalition of 
eleven Veterans service organizations representing millions of 
Veterans, servicemembers, spouses and survivors.

 In my short time on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, we 
have made great strides toward a budget that lives up to the sacrifices 
of our Veterans. We voted to increase the budget for the VA by $5.6 
billion--an increase of 11.7% for Veterans health care and other 
programs. We ensured that Veterans are given their fair share of the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, providing $1.4 billion for 
maintenance at VA medical facilities, construction of Veterans' 
extended care facilities, and Veteran cemetery repairs, as well as 
providing one-time payments of $250 to disabled veterans.

 However, we still struggle to provide sufficient, timely, and 
predictable funding for our Veterans. When the Veterans Health Care 
Budget Reform and Transparency Act arrives at the floor of the House, I 
would urge all Members of the Arizona delegation and from all across 
the Nation to support it to ensure Veterans can get the care they have 
earned.
