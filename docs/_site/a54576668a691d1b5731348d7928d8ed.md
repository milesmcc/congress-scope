Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, Halliburton has decided to move its 
headquarters to Dubai. This is a company that has received over $25 
billion worth


of contracts in Iraq, and this is the kind of thanks the U.S. taxpayers 
get. In fact, this is a real slap in the face of the U.S. taxpayers.

The ABC National News reported Sunday night that Halliburton has been 
charged by government inspectors of overcharging our government and 
overcharging our taxpayers to the tune of $2.7 billion. No company that 
commits those types of overcharges should ever get a Federal contract 
again. In fact, in my opinion, the U.S. Government should not give a 
contract to any company that cannot certify that over half of its 
employees are U.S. citizens.
