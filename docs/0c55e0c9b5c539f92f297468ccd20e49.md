# ALL NIGHT SENATE SESSION
## `0c55e0c9b5c539f92f297468ccd20e49`
`Mr. HODES â€” 18 July 2007`

---


Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, the Senate was in session all night long 
because Senate Republicans refuse to allow a fair up or down vote on an 
amendment that would redeploy our troops by April of next year.

Today, Senate Democrats want a vote on an amendment offered by 
Senators Levin and Reed, but Republicans are using the filibuster to 
prevent a fair majority vote. Do Senate Republicans really want to 
obstruct the process on the most critical issue of our time?

The American people are demanding change in Iraq, and while a 
majority of Senate Republicans refuse to listen, nearly a dozen 
Republicans have said the administration must change its strategy in 
Iraq. These Republicans need to realize that their words are important, 
but they will only have meaning if they choose to act and support the 
Levin-Reed amendment.

We all know that President Bush has no intention of making any 
changes in his war policy, and so it is up to Congress to force that 
change, which is why last night's all-night debate in the Senate was so 
important. Let's hope wayward Senate Republicans are finally listening.
