Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Army 
Sergeant Brandon Silk of Orono, Maine, who was killed while serving his 
country in Afghanistan.

Brandon was well-loved by everyone in his family and community. He is 
remembered for his personality, self-determination and self-confidence. 
On June 21st, Sergeant Silk died from injuries he suffered in a hard 
landing on his second Afghanistan tour. At 25 years old, Sergeant 
Silk's youth punctuates an already painful loss.

Brandon Silk, a fan of hunting, music, motorcycles and the Red Sox, 
graduated from Orono High School in 2003, where he excelled in football 
and track. After graduating, Brandon enlisted in the U.S. Army, 
volunteering to serve and protect his country. He was a Black Hawk crew 
chief and a member of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, 
Kentucky. He was on his fourth tour of duty having served in Korea, 
Iraq and two tours in Afghanistan.

In Maine, our communities are known for coming together during a 
crisis, and I know that everyone in the state stands together to 
support the Silk family. Brandon is mourned by all as a true American 
hero and a defender of the freedom we all hold dear.

Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring the memory of Sergeant 
Brandon Silk for his patriotism and devotion to his community and his 
country.
