`Mr. HAGEL â€” 25 January 2007`

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss 
of U.S. Army 1LT Jacob Fritz of Nebraska. Lieutenant Fritz died from 
wounds sustained in an ambush in Karbala, Iraq, on January 20. He was 
25 years old.

Lieutenant Fritz was raised on his family's farm near Verdon, NE. 
From a young age, Lieutenant Fritz knew he wanted to be a leader. After 
graduating from Dawson-Verdon High School in 2000, he followed through 
on this goal. I had the honor of nominating Lieutenant Fritz to the 
U.S. Military Academy at West Point and he graduated from the Academy 
in 2005. His brother, Daniel Fritz, 22, followed in his footsteps and 
is currently in his third year at West Point.

Lieutenant Fritz was leading a unit of more than 30 soldiers in Iraq 
since October. Lieutenant Fritz described his mission as a liaison 
between Iraqi police and the U.S. Army. He said the work was 
challenging but rewarding. Thousands of brave Americans like Lieutenant 
Fritz are currently serving in Iraq. We are proud of Lieutenant Fritz's 
service to our country.

In addition to his brother, Lieutenant Fritz is survived by his 
parents Lyle and Noala and his younger brother Ethan.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring 1LT 
Jacob Fritz.
