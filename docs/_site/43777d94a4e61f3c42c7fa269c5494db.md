Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.

It failed them when it sent too few troops with too little armor. It 
failed them when it turned the reconstruction of Iraq into a political 
science project.

We in the Senate will fail them today if we do not vote to change 
course and to bring our soldiers home.

At the end of this debate, the American people will know where each 
of us stands. On our side of the aisle, we stand with the American 
people. The voters told us in November to change course and begin to 
bring our troops home, and that is what we are going to do. We stand 
for our constitutional system in which the Congress speaks for the 
people in matters of war and peace and can require that the President 
listen to them. Finally, we stand with our troops. We alone are 
insisting on a policy worthy of their courage and worthy of their 
sacrifice.

Peace and progress in Iraq must be earned by the Iraqis and their 
neighbors. We must no longer send our brave soldiers into an uncertain 
fate on the streets of Baghdad. Bring them home to the heroes welcome 
they have earned.
