Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. The motion to recommit would restore funding 
originally included in the bill as reported by the Appropriations 
Committee for advanced procurement for 12 F-22 aircraft and allow the 
program to move forward. It would also provide an additional $100 
million for the Army military personnel accounts. These increases are 
offset by cutting $400 million in unrequested funds for the 
Presidential helicopter, a troubled program that the President himself 
has proposed to eliminate.

My motion to recommit is consistent with the recently passed Defense 
authorization bill which recognized the continued vital need for the F-
22 by authorizing an additional F-22 aircraft and, at the same time, 
did not authorize additional funding for the President's helicopter.

Mr. Speaker, while much is made of the President's threatened veto of 
this bill over the F-22, the fact of the matter is the President has 
also threatened a veto over funding for the Presidential helicopter. 
While I appreciate the President has a role in this process, it is 
Congress, not the President, that has the power of the purse. I do not 
believe that we should simply take the President's budget proposal and 
rubber-stamp it.



In addition, my motion to recommit begins to fill a known funding 
shortfall in the Army military and personnel accounts that resulted 
from Secretary Gates' recent decision to increase the total Army end 
strength by 22,000 troops to support the administration's Afghanistan 
policy.

My motion would also leave intact the additional funds added in the 
Murtha amendment for four of the Air Force's unfunded priorities.

I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit.

I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), a member of the 
Armed Services Committee, for the remaining time.
