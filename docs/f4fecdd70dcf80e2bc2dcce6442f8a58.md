Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I point out also that in a recent report, 
U.S. officials said the Taliban's new top operations officer in 
southern Afghanistan is a former prisoner at the Guantanamo detention 
center.

Pentagon and CIA officials said Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul was among 13 
prisoners released to the Afghan Government in December 2007. He is now 
known as Mullah Abdullah Zakir, a name officials say is used by the 
Taliban leader in charge of operations against United States and Afghan 
forces in southern Afghanistan.

One intelligence official told the Associated Press that Rasoul's 
stated mission is to counter the growing U.S. troop surge. I wished to 
put that in the Record.

I yield the floor.
