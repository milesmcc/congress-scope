Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
me the time. I didn't intend to speak on this until I read the bill, 
and I didn't have much chance to read the bill because it didn't go 
through any committee, and it was only introduced last night.

But this bill is an illusion. It is not what it is proposed to be. It 
is one of those situations where you giveth on one hand, and you take 
away with the other hand.

I am looking specifically at subsection (e). After saying that we 
have to remove our troops out of Iraq within so many days, subsection 
(e) says, ''the Secretary of Defense may retain''--in other words, keep 
troops in Iraq--''for the purpose of providing security for the 
embassy, the U.S. embassy''; we do that now. And ''other United States 
diplomatic missions in Iraq''; other diplomatic missions in Iraq; we do 
that now. ''Protecting American citizens''; we do that now. ''Including 
members of the Armed Services serving in roles consistent with 
customary diplomatic positions''; we do that now.

Listen to this one: ''engaging in targeted special actions limited in 
duration and scope to killing or capturing members of al Qaeda and 
other terrorist organizations''. My goodness, that is what we are doing 
now.

''Training and equipping members of the Iraqi Security Forces.'' That 
is what we are doing now. ''And may retain in Iraq members of the Army 
Corps of Engineers and Defense contractors engaged in reconstruction 
projects in Iraq.'' We are doing that now.

Subsection (h) on page 4. ''Prohibition on the use of funds to 
further deploy United States Armed Forces to Iraq.'' The funds may not 
be obligated or expended to further deploy units or members of the 
Armed Forces to Iraq, including through participation in any 
multinational force, except as provided under subsection (e), which is 
the subsection that I just referred to.

And then it goes to subsection (i), assistance to Iraqi security 
forces. ''Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or 
otherwise restrict the use of funds available to the Department of 
Defense for the purpose of


providing financial assistance or equipment to the Iraqi Security 
Forces or multinational forces providing security or training in 
Iraq.'' We do that now.

You have to get out of Iraq, but you are allowed to stay to do all of 
these things that we are already doing.

Vote yes if you want to. Vote no if you want to. That is not up to 
me. But I just wanted to point out the fact that, if you think this 
bill gets you out of Iraq, think again. Read subsection (e), because it 
doesn't accomplish what we are told that it does.

So I say again, this is an illusion. It gives with one hand, but it 
takes away with the other.
