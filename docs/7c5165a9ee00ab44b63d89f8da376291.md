Mr. REID. Could ask for 60 votes. I say to my friend, hypothetically 
that is true, but that is the way it is with many things in this body. 
But that person would have to come forward, identify themselves, and 
stand up and say:


I do not want the debate on Iraq to go forward. This is a little 
difficult to do with the situation where, as I said before, everybody 
in America wants this debate to go forward. So let's hear somebody on 
the other side stand up, akin to a Senator who believes in something, 
and say: I don't want this debate to go forward.
