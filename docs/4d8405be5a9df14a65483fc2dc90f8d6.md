Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, let me join Majority Leader Reid in 
saluting these incredible Americans who are with us today, wounded 
warriors and Bob O'Malley. As someone who served 12 years in the U.S. 
Army, my appreciation is profound for what you have done and continue 
to do. Thank you very much.

I have a circuitous connection with the 10th Mountain Division. My 
classmate, Buster Hagenbeck, commanded the 10th Mountain Division in 
Afghanistan, and I was there to visit those great soldiers several 
times. Thank you for your service and thank you for your inspiration.
