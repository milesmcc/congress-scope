Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Speaker, H.R. 2276 honors the life of a young man who fought 
bravely for his country and made the ultimate sacrifice for our 
freedom. Corporal Christopher Esckelson was killed during combat action 
in Fallujah, Iraq on December 28, 2006. He was less than 1 week shy of 
reaching his 23rd birthday.

Christopher Esckelson felt personal anger after September 11, 2001, 
when his country was brutally attacked, and he knew immediately he 
wanted to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. In addition to defending his 
country, it was a way to earn money for college. His plans included 
attending medical school. His dream of becoming a doctor, however, was 
cut short on a 5-day mission fighting insurgents in a war-torn 
Fallujah.

Corporal Esckelson was a squad leader of 12 men and suffered a direct 
hit during a mission. His leadership skills were proven day in and day 
out while in Iraq. He knew the risks involved and experienced the 
horrors of war. But his determination to fight and win was evident. He 
was fearless on the battlefield.

Christopher never had the chance to return home safely from the war 
or attend medical school as he planned, but he will surely be 
remembered in his community by the naming of this post office in his 
hometown of Vassar, Michigan. I am pleased to support H.R. 2276 in 
naming of the post office for this valiant soldier.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
