`Mr. CLYBURN â€” 22 June 2010`

Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a popular 
television personality in Columbia, South Carolina as she leaves her 
post as a morning news anchor on Tuesday, June 22, 2010. Kara Gormley 
is a familiar face to Columbians who have watched her professionally 
report the news at WIS-TV for more than a decade. Her presence on the 
Sunrise program will be sorely missed.

Kara Gormley is a native of Carthage, New York, and is the daughter 
of the late Barbara and Robert Gormley. After graduating from 
Providence College in Rhode Island, Kara took her first broadcast 
journalism job in Wausau, Wisconsin. Midlands viewers first came to 
know Kara when she joined WIS News 10 in 1996 as co-host of the Sunrise 
program. She later took an assignment to anchor the evening news at 
5:00 p.m., and serve as a featured health reporter.

In 2000, she was lured away from WIS, and became the morning news 
anchor at the NBC


sister station in Raleigh, North Carolina. Her heart remained in 
Columbia, and Kara married Banks Meador, a native of Chester, in 2002, 
which led to her return to WIS. Back in Columbia, she anchored the 
weekend news and served as a weekday reporter. Later she rejoined the 
Sunrise program, where her journey at WIS began.

Kara has been recognized for her journalism talent by the Associated 
Press and the South Carolina Broadcasters Association. She has also 
earned the prestigious Edward R. Murrow Award of Excellence.

She has been very active in the Midlands community. Kara has 
generously donated her time and her talents to the National Alliance of 
the Mentally Ill, Special Olympics South Carolina, Project Pet, 
Sistercare, Camp Kemo, the Children's Miracle Network and Palmetto 
Health Children's Hospital. She is also an active supporter of 
Winston's Wish, a foundation of autistic children, and the national 
Safety Council's ''Alive at 25'' program, which promotes safe driving 
habits among drivers under 25.

Kara takes great pride in her contribution to Faces of Freedom, a 
book that profiles fallen heroes who lost their lives in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. The proceeds of the book go to charities that benefit 
military families.

As a former competitive swimmer and scholarship athlete, Kara is 
dedicated to promoting physical fitness. She helped create and build 
Limitless Sports, an organization that helps wheelchair-bound children 
and adults participate in athletics.

Kara and her husband will remain in Columbia, where she will focus on 
raising their three young sons--Dalton, Evan and Cooper.

Madam Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me on 
congratulating Kara Gormley for her contributions to the field of 
broadcast journalism and to her dedication to making her community a 
better place to live. She has enriched the lives of so many during her 
years at WIS-TV, and I wish her all the best as she pursues other 
endeavors.
