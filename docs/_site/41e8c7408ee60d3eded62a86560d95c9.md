`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 2 April 2008`

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. You were mentioning the troops and how complicated 
things have gotten.

One of the things you mentioned was what was happening in Iraq, and 
Mr. Meek mentioned how we got in. I think it is important to recognize, 
and there was a great article today in the Washington Post, what is 
happening with our troop strength, where we are getting to the point, 
we have all of these troops who go for 15 months and come back for a 
year. We are hearing from psychologists and psychiatrists at Walter 
Reed that they are not getting enough downtime. It is intense, urban 
warfare. They are not getting enough downtime, and that is contributing 
to a lot of the psychiatric problems that our troops are coming back 
with that need to be addressed.

What people are saying now in the military is that it has to be a 
year on or 15 months on, and 2 years off. Can you imagine if that is 
the recommendation. The recommendation is 15 months and then 2 years. 
Or it may even be 1 year. No, they are asking for 1 year on, 2 years 
off; and then if they have to go back, send them back. Can you imagine, 
that is the recommendation.

For them to now say you wonder what the issues are going to be when 
it is 15 months on, 1 year off and back again, the psychological effect 
on our soldiers and the cost long term to our VA health care. I think 
that is important.

I wanted to highlight this. This is General Richard Cody, Army's vice 
chief of staff who was testifying yesterday, and was talking about 
basically troop strength. Mr. Meek, you sit on the Armed Services 
Committee. You know how critical this is to where our country needs to 
be in case there is another conflict somewhere in the world that we 
have to react to.

Right now what the military leaders are saying is that we do not have 
the capability to react to that. Now can you imagine putting this 
country in that position, that we can't handle two separate fights 
going on at the same time when that has been the golden rule from the 
military for years. And what Cody said was that ''I've never seen our 
lack of strategic depth be where it is today. The Nation needs an 
airborne brigade, a heavy brigade, and a striker brigade ready for 
'full spectrum operations' and we don't have that today.''

Now if anybody wants to make a judgment, it is not the Democrats


making a judgment against President Bush, this is the Army vice chief 
of staff who happens to be retiring in the next couple of months and 
maybe feels a little freer to say the kinds of things that need to be 
said, but if we don't recognize what position we are in, and then to 
have some folks saying we need to be there another hundred years, how 
are we going to possibly sustain this?
