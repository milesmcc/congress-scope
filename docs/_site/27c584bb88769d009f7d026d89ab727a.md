`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 21 July 2009`

---


Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Arizona. We have illuminated 
most of the reasons in our exchange why this amendment is important. I 
will simply add a few more things Secretary Gates said yesterday, which 
is:




 The army has reached a point of diminishing returns in 


 their multiyear program to reduce the size of its training 


 and support ''tail.''


That is the training and support which supports the Active-Duty Army.




 The cumulative effect of these factors is that the Army 


 faces a period where its ability to continue to deploy combat 


 units at acceptable fill rates is at serious risk.


Here is the point I just made in response to Senator McCain's 
question.




 Based on current deployment estimates, this is a temporary 


 challenge--


A temporary point of stress. We hope and pray that is true. It 
certainly looks like it is--



 which will peak in the coming year and abate over the course 


 of the next 3 years.


Mr. President, in addition to the Secretary of Defense, we heard from 
the Army's Chief of Staff, GEN George Casey, and Secretary of the Army 
Pete Geren, who have been advocates within the Pentagon for this 
increase in end strength, and I thank them for that. Admiral Mullen, 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told our Armed Services Committee earlier 
this year that the light at the end of the tunnel, as he put it, is 
still more than 2 years away, and that is only if everything goes 
according to plan, which in combat, obviously, often does not.

Again, I say this is an authorization; it is not a mandate. I will 
add that Secretary Gates announced yesterday that he will find a way to 
fund the additional troops in this year and fiscal year 2010--the one 
that begins October 1--by reprogramming other funds appropriated to the 
Pentagon for fiscal year 2011, which is the budget that will be 
presented to us next year, if it is probable that the Department of 
Defense will require funding as part of its normal operations, and more 
likely as part of the OCO fund--the overseas contingency operation 
fund--which supports our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I cannot say enough, I know all of us in the Senate believe we cannot 
say enough, in gratitude to the members of the U.S. Army who are 
leading the battle for us against the Islamic extremists and terrorists 
who attacked us on 9/11/01. We owe them a debt we can never fully 
repay.

One thing we can do, that Secretary Gates did yesterday and the 
Senate can do in this amendment, is to send a message to our troops in 
the field that help is on the way in the most consequential way, which 
is additional members of the Army.

I ask that when the vote be taken, it be taken by the yeas and nays.
