Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, we are at the fifth anniversary of the 
war in Iraq, a war based on lies. A war that has cost the lives of over 
4,000 of our brave young men and women, the injuries to tens of 
thousands, over 1 million innocent Iraqis have perished, a cost of up 
to $3 trillion.

Let us speak out for peace, as the Winter Soldiers today are speaking 
out for peace by communicating the truth of a soldier's experience in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. Let us speak out for peace as the young people 
involved in the Stop Loss project are doing. Let us speak out for peace 
and stop financing this war and use the money to bring our troops home.

Let us speak out for peace, for international peacekeepers to move 
into Iraq as our troops lead. America has had a long period of silence 
about this war. Let us be silent no more. Let us speak out for peace.
