`Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas â€” 23 June 2008`

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. If I may quickly conclude so my 
distinguished friend from Georgia, who has made some valid points about 
the Iraq war that we are still suffering, I was reading something, 
Congressman Johnson, about the condition of the Iraq oil wells and the 
difficulty of bringing them online and the need for U.S. investment or 
other investment.

It is interesting, a lot of people think we are making a lot of money 
in Iraq; we are spending a lot of money in Iraq, I will tell you that.

Let me say this. I will thank all three of my colleagues. I will 
continue to work and pursue an answer. The Representative indicated he 
was very interested, and would go back and ask. The meeting is in 
September and I will pursue that. I don't have the exact location, but 
I believe it is in Europe. If so, it would be easy for us to go.

I think the other part would be to give the energy leadership of 
these multinationals, and obviously they are in my congressional 
district, but a forum to be able to have a conversation outside of a 
hearing setting. We need to ask the hard questions. We need to ask how 
much of the cost of gasoline is the refinery cost? How much of the cost 
of jet fuel is refinery cost? What is attributable to having old 
refineries, and what can you do to make the energy name of your 
industry more diverse, to have more green and more alternatives such as 
wind and biomass.

I am told that wind is very expensive, but you can't get that answer 
if we are not sitting down at the table.

I thank the gentleman for the idea of a summit. We may work on that. 
Let me conclude by saying we have been working in this Congress. I 
don't want anyone to think that we have not been sensitive. You listed 
a whole road map that you, Mr. Towns, as a senior member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee have been very much involved in. For example, 
the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008, a 
combination of the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy Committee, 
which I think is very important because it encourages the development 
of innovative technologies, creating new jobs, reducing carbon 
emissions, protecting consumers, shifting production to cleaner 
renewable energy, and modernizing our energy infrastructure.

The note I want to end on is we have to get more young people 
involved.
