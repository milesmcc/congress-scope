Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the 
continued obstructionism in the Senate, led by our Republican 
colleagues, concerning the vote on supporting or opposing the 
President's escalation of the war in Iraq.

For 2 weeks our distinguished majority leader has been trying to get 
an agreement to just proceed to a fair debate, to just have the 
opportunity on the floor of the Senate to have a debate on whether we 
support the President's escalation of the war in Iraq. He has offered 
an up-or-down vote on two different proposals--one opposing the 
escalation, the second supporting it. At every turn he has been 
stymied.

Our Republican minority claims they want to debate the war in Iraq, 
but they have done everything they can to obstruct the debate. I would 
like to go through some of the history of this obstructionism. Since 
the first of the year, Republicans have rejected at least three 
different compromises that would have allowed the Senate to move 
forward with a vote on the escalation of the war in Iraq. In an effort 
to obtain an up-or-down vote on the bipartisan resolution disapproving 
the President's plan, Senate Democrats offered to schedule an up-or-
down vote on the McCain-Graham resolution supporting the President's 
plan. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership rejected this offer on 
what they claimed to support.

Then we, as Senate Democrats, offered the Republican leadership up-
or-down votes on two other resolutions--the Gregg resolution and a 
resolution stating simply that the Senate does not support the surge 
and demands that the troops deploying to Iraq receive the body armor 
and other equipment they need. The Republican leadership again rejected 
the offer.

Finally, Senate Democrats offered to allow votes on the bipartisan 
resolution and the McCain-Gramm resolution that would each have 
required a supermajority of 60 votes. The Republican leadership again 
said no.

The pattern of obstruction has, unfortunately, continued. On February 
5, all but two Republican Senators opted to block a debate, including 
the distinguished author of the resolution--chose to block debate on 
whether we support the President's escalation plan. The reaction across 
the country was echoed in numerous newspaper headlines.
