`Mr. KINGSTON â€” 14 May 2009`

Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, one of the smartest things that the President did once 
elected and all the campaign rhetoric was out of the way, he went ahead 
and continued the Bush-Cheney policy in the Middle East, primarily by 
reappointing Secretary of Defense Gates and recognizing that the surge, 
in fact, worked, basically kept the plans for Iraq and Afghanistan on 
track, including a new surge in Afghanistan.

There was one sharp deviation from the Bush doctrine that Mr. Obama 
did not choose to follow, and that was his idea of closing Guantanamo 
even though the Guantanamo prison has proved to be effective. And we 
had lots of testimony from people who are in the military and security 
that these very bad actors need to stay in an island off continental 
America. That's why we Republicans in committee offered the Wolf 
amendment that says that if you're going to transfer the Guantanamo 
prisoners, that we should have the Nation's governors approve the 
transfers to their States before it happens.

Also that a threat assessment should be done. Now to their credit, 
the majority party did put in some language that says the President 
shall submit to Congress in writing a comprehensive plan before October 
1, and we're happy about that. But what this plan does not do, it does 
not require a risk assessment.

Releasing the detainees to American soils could cause problems, and 
we would also like to see the security assessment include what its 
impact could be on the safety of American citizens. Also it does not 
require notification to Congress, governors, State legislators or local 
communities. We believe that much courtesy should be done. And it does 
not require the consent of the State governor.

Why is that important? It's interesting to note that when the 
President was recently in Europe, trying to ask them to take some of 
the Guantanamo prisoners, they all declined. All the European, all the 
EU countries want us to close it, but they won't take any of these 
prisoners. What does that say?
