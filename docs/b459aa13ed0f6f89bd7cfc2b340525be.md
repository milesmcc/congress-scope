Mr. ANDREWS. I thank the chairman for yielding.

I oppose this amendment because I believe its provisions subvert the 
best hope for stabilizing Iraq and ending the Iraqi civil war. I 
believe that if the responsible Sunni and Shia leadership in that 
country believe that it will become their responsibility to reach a 
political settlement to the end of the civil war, they will do so. I 
believe they will never accept that responsibility if they believe that 
the presence of the United States is permanent and indefinite.

I think, as the base bill does, that making a statement that we do 
not wish to have permanent bases in Iraq supports this theory, and will 
bring about a greater probability of stabilization of Iraq and an end 
to the Iraqi civil war.

So I believe the amendment sends precisely the wrong message and I 
oppose it.
