Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, this recommittal motion is something that we 
have seen for approximately 5 minutes. I think it is a dubious 
proposition to be voting on something this serious with less than 10 
minutes of consideration.

But upon a cursory reading of it, it is apparent that the purpose of 
this proposition is simply to prevent people from voting on the 
underlying bill. It is designed to gut the bill by adding two 
additional conditions that would enable our troops to stay in Iraq 
indefinitely. Those conditions make reference to the regional security 
of the Middle East and the national security interest of the United 
States. That language is so broad that virtually any deployment of any 
armed force could be justified under that language.

It is obvious that would in fact essentially gut the proposal, and so 
I would urge a ''no'' vote on the motion to recommit.

Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).
