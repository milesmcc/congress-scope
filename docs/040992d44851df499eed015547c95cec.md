Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, over the last month this Democratic Congress 
has passed important legislation that will help our economy, our 
veterans, and millions of middle class families. But our efforts are 
being opposed by a Bush White House that refuses to work with us to 
solve our Nation's most pressing problems.

We can't turn around our economy without addressing the escalating 
housing crisis. Last month, we passed a comprehensive package that 
addresses the crisis directly, helps stabilize the housing market, and 
makes a real difference for families at risk for losing their homes.

To help jump-start our economy and help reduce prices at the gas 
pump, we passed legislation that extends vital tax relief to millions 
of families, strengthens investment opportunities for American 
businesses, and encourages the production and use of renewable energy. 
To help veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we passed a new 
GI Bill that restores promised 4-year scholarships so they can go to 
college after they complete their military service.

Mr. Speaker, we are passing legislation here in the House that can 
make a real difference for all Americans.
