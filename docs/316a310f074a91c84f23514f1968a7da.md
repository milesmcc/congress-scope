Mr. MURPHY of New York. Madam Speaker, the following is an exchange

Communication between Carrie Farley and Derek Farley before he left 
for Afghanistan September 11, 2009:




 It was nice hearing your voice and thank you for the call.



 I'm proud of you Derek, you are right. For a young man 


 you've accomplished and experienced a lot within your years 


 of travel. You've met some really good friends, people you 


 will always be able to depend on and will have your back.



 All these experiences have made you a wonderful young man 


 and I'm proud to be your mother.





 I love you,































Mom.
