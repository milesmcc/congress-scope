`Mr. JONES â€” 18 November 2009`

---


Mr. JONES. Yes. Congressman Kagen, I want to thank you for giving me 
a chance to be a small part of this debate tonight. I'm glad its a 
bipartisan support. Yes, I have Camp Lejeune Marine Base in my 
district; Cherry Point Marine Air Station; and also Seymour Johnson Air 
Force Base.

I want to take just a few minutes; a very few. I wanted to share with 
this debate tonight that this is not--as Mr. McGovern said, this is an 
American issue. It's not a Democrat or Republican, it's not a liberal 
or conservative. But let me start with two conservatives.

This was written by George Will, a nationally syndicated column of 
September 1, 2009. George Will, ''Time to Get Out of Afghanistan.''

'' 'Yesterday,' reads the e-mail from Allen, a marine in Afghanistan, 
'I gave blood because a marine, while out on patrol, stepped on a 
(mine's) pressure plate and lost both legs.' Then 'another marine with 
a bullet wound to the head was brought in. Both marines died this 
morning.'

'I'm sorry about the drama,' writes Allen, an enthusiastic 
infantryman willing to die 'so that each of you may grow old.' He says: 
'I put everything in God's hands.' And: 'Semper fi!' ''

George Will further writes, ''Allen and others of America's finest 
are also in Washington's hands. This city should keep faith with them 
by rapidly reversing the trajectory of America's involvement in 
Afghanistan, where, says the Dutch commander of coalition forces in a 
southern province, walking through the region is 'like walking through 
the Old Testament.'''

Let me read from another conservative, Peggy Noonan. This was written 
on October 10 in The Wall Street Journal. ''So far, oddly, most of the 
debate over Afghanistan has taken place among journalists and foreign-
policy professionals. All power to them: They've been fighting it out 
on op-ed pages and in journals for months now, in many cases with a 
moral seriousness, good faith, and sense of protectiveness toward the 
interests of the United States that is, actually, moving. But nobody 
elected them. We need a truly national debate.''

Those two articles, I wanted to read those parts because I want to 
thank you, Congressmen Kagen, McGovern, and Ron Paul and myself, Walter 
Jones, for being here tonight, for this reason: Mr. McGovern is exactly 
right, you're right, so is Mr. Paul. This is a debate that needs to 
take place in the daytime with 435 Members of Congress, because our men 
and women in uniform will go to their death for this country, but 
they're worn out. There are four and five deployments to Afghanistan 
and Iraq. And if we don't meet our constitutional responsibility--and I 
agree with Mr. Paul, we should declare war, but we don't do that any 
more. We just pass these resolutions to give the authority to the 
President. The time has come for the Congress to act on behalf of the 
American people and, more important, to act on behalf of our troops 
that we are about to break.

The last point. Today, I wrote Mr. Obama a note and thanked him for 
taking time to look carefully at what the options should be. And I want 
to say as a conservative Republican, again, thank you, Mr. Obama, for 
taking the time, because our boys and girls, our young men and women, 
they deserve the right decision as it relates to Afghanistan. Thank 
you.
