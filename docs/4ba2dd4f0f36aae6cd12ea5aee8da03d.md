Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, in August the Congress passed the Protect America Act. 
Before that bill passed, our intelligence officials did not have the 
tools they needed to protect our troops and to detect and prevent 
terrorist plots. This was made clear in a story we read about just last 
month about our, how our FISA laws failed our soldiers who were 
kidnapped in Iraq, and I think these outdated laws actually hampered 
their rescue. That is because our FISA laws in place before the Protect 
America Act entrusted government lawyers, not our intelligence 
professionals, to protect our troops and our security.

Yet the bill we are considering today only makes this problem worse. 
It reopens the terrorist loophole and doesn't ensure that we can act 
quickly on vital intelligence to protect our troops and the American 
people. I think it would be a boon to trial lawyers who could take 
actions against third parties who assisted our government at our 
request after 9/11. It is yet another example of a troubling pattern of 
behavior on the part the majority, a pattern of behavior that is 
undermining our national security. Let me just give you a few examples.

The majority want to extend habeas corpus rights to terrorists. The 
majority has had over 40 votes in the Congress trying to force retreat 
in Iraq. The majority wants to close down our Guantanamo detention 
facility and move those terrorists into American communities. The 
majority, in their intelligence authorization bill and appropriation 
bill, are diverting key intelligence resources away from terrorist 
surveillance to study global warming.

In August, all the Members of this House succeeded in modernizing 
FISA and closing the terrorist loophole. We did so because terrorists 
were plotting to kill Americans and our allies, and there is no nice 
way of saying that. So why on Earth would we tie the hands of our 
intelligence officials again and open up this loophole that allows 
terrorists to jeopardize the safety of our troops and jeopardize the 
safety and security of the American people?

Our country is safer today because of our efforts, and Republicans 
want to work with Democrats to make the Protect America Act permanent. 
We were very close to a bipartisan agreement on this bill just about 5 
weeks ago, very close. As a matter of fact, there was an agreement in 
principle until the ACLU got ahold of it and blew the entire bipartisan 
process up. I think the American people want us to do everything we can 
to make sure that they are safe and secure. The bill that we have 
before us will once again tie the hands of our intelligence officials 
and make America less safe. This is not the bill that I want to vote 
for.
