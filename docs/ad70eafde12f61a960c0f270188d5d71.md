`Mr. CORNYN â€” 12 December 2007`

Mr. CORNYN. Well, Mr. President, responding through the Chair, I 
would say I did attend that meeting, at which time we were told that 
civilian employees at the Department of Defense would, at about the 
middle of December, receive a notice that they would be laid off just 
prior to Christmas because of 60-day notice requirements, and that, in 
fact, the military was only able to sustain the effort in Iraq fighting 
al-Qaida--the same people who killed 3,000 Americans on September 11, 
2001--by moving money from one account to another, causing a lot of 
disruption, increased expense, and a lot of other problems.

I do not know why our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, 
after having 63 votes on Iraq so far, attempting to propose surrender 
dates and to countermand the orders of our generals in the field, are 
resisting supporting our troops during a time of war. It is unthinkable 
to me.

So I am sorry they are continuing to block this necessary funding for 
our troops and putting 100,000 employees at the Department of Defense--
civilian employees--in jeopardy during the holiday season. But I was 
there, and I did hear those comments, in addition to the comments I 
have just added.
