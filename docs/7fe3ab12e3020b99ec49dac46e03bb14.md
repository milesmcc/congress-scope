Mr. SESTAK. I can be and am disappointed in this bill we will vote on 
today, intended to reduce U.S. troops in Iraq. It aims to begin the 
reduction, but leaves an unspecified limited presence of troops in Iraq 
by a deadline of April 1, 2008, a level of troops and their missions to 
be determined by President Bush.

It does no harm, but how much good? One might say it is a step in the 
right direction even with such significant limitations, but I have 
concern. Congress is, as it should be, close to ending this tragic 
misadventure; however, ending this war is necessary but insufficient. 
How we end it and by what means is of even greater importance for our 
troops' safety and our own security. A Congress intent upon mandating 
such a new security policy through force of law owes a careful 
explanation to the country why and how it is to be done, including 
dealing with what would occur in the aftermath. We don't do that here.

I will vote for this bill for it does no harm, perhaps some good. But 
I will do so reluctantly, for it does little to define the how and why 
within a strategic approach of a date within a year that we can 
redeploy from Iraq and leave behind the possibility of an unfailed 
Iraqi state. We owe such an explanation since it is us by force of law 
that will end this tragic misadventure.
