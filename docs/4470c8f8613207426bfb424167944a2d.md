Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to this 
measure, not because I do not agree with the goal sought by this 
Feingold amendment; I agree with it. However, it was the decision of 
the leadership of the committee that matters that can be appropriately 
debated in the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill should be debated 
there.

I believe if we open the door to the Feingold amendment, then I am in 
no position to suggest we oppose other appropriate measures for the 
supplemental. Therefore, reluctantly, but forcefully, I must say I hope 
my colleagues will support me in opposing this measure.

I thank you, sir.
