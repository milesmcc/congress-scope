`Mr. BURTON of Indiana â€” 23 March 2007`

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I understand my Democrat 
colleagues have the votes. I guess there was a lot of arm twisting last 
night. So congratulations on getting the votes necessary to pass this. 
But I am sad because this bill spends $31 billion more than the 
President requested. It is a budget buster. And also I am kind of sad 
because I think a little bit about history.

You know, if George Washington had a Congress with the attitude of 
this Congress, we might very well have lost the Revolutionary War. If 
Abraham Lincoln had a Congress with the attitude of this Congress, we 
might very well have lost the Civil War. And I am sad for our valiant 
troops who you are going to jerk out of Iraq. It is a withdrawal bill. 
That is what you want to do, withdraw. And I am sad for our troops, our 
valiant troops, who want to win. Who want to win. And you are not going 
to let them if you have your way.

So I would just like to say, if I were talking to the President of 
the United States today, Mr. President, hang tough. Hang tough.
