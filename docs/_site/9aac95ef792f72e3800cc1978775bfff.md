`Mr. BAYH â€” 5 November 2007`

---


Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep 
sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Idaville, 
IN. CPT Timothy McGovern, 28 years old, died October 31 in Mosul, Iraq. 
Captain McGovern died of injuries he sustained when an improvised 
explosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an optimistic future 
before him, Timothy risked everything to fight for the values Americans 
hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.

Timothy was a graduate of Twin Lakes High School and Purdue 
University, where he began his military service in the Reserve Officers 
Training Corps. At Twin Lakes, he was a leader on the football team and 
ran on the track team. His football coach and uncle, Mike Wright, said 
that he could depend on Timothy on the field because of his 
intelligence and positive attitude. He always supported his teammates. 
Later in life, he would support his fellow soldiers.

Timothy wanted to be a soldier nearly all his life, and he believed 
strongly in the goals of our engagement in Iraq. Two weeks before his 
death, Timothy spoke to a local radio station about the positive impact 
Americans at home can have on the morale of the soldiers abroad, 
saying, ''Any support they get, any letters they get, anything like 
that is great for morale and lets the soldiers here know that people 
still care about them and care about what they're doing.''

Timothy was serving a second tour of duty when he died. He was a 
member of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division 
from Fort Bliss, TX. For his service and sacrifice, he was awarded the 
Purple Heart and the Bronze Star. Timothy is survived by his parents, 
LTC Colonel Bill McGovern and Jonell McGovern, and his sister, Miranda.

Today, I join Timothy's family and friends in mourning his death. 
While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take 
pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer 
place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will 
remember when they think of Timothy. Today and always, Timothy will be 
remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true 
American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully 
serving his country.

As I search for words to do justice in honoring Timothy's sacrifice, 
I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the 
families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ''We cannot dedicate, we 
cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living 
and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor 
power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember 
what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This 
statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am 
certain that the impact of Timothy's actions will live on far longer 
that any record of these words.

It is my sad duty to enter the name of CPT Timothy I. McGovern in the 
official Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and 
for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I 
think about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate 
pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like 
Timothy's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who 
said, ''He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe 
away tears from off all faces.''

May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be 
with all of you, as I know He is with Timothy.
