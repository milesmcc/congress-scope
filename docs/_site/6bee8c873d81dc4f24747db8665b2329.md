Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, Theodore Roosevelt said: ''No man is worth 
his salt who is not ready at all times to risk his well-being, to risk 
his body, to risk his life, in a great cause.'' The Patriot Guard 
Riders are a group of motorcyclists who pay tribute to those who have 
died serving our country. Their mission is to attend the funeral 
services of fallen soldiers upholding President Roosevelt's belief that 
brave soldiers who gave the utmost sacrifice for their country deserve 
respect and reverence during their final tribute.

Each mission has two objectives, to show sincere respect for 
America's fallen heroes, their families, and their communities; and to 
shield the mourning family and their friends from interruptions created 
by any protestor or group of protestors. In 2 short years, the Patriot 
Guard Riders has become a 501(c)(3) charity, comprised of more than 
140,000 volunteers across the country that take off from


work and use their own funds for gas and whatever else is needed to 
attend missions.

The Guard is activated each time the military reports the death of a 
soldier in Iraq. This nationwide organization of volunteers is very 
efficient. State Captains send out e-mails to members in the city where 
the soldier will be buried, and everyone jumps into action. They ensure 
that streets along the funeral procession are lined with American 
flags. Each mission is accomplished through legal and non-violent 
means. If protestors are present and become loud, the Patriot Guard 
Riders form a flag line, turn their backs on protesters, and will even 
drown the sound of the protestors by singing and reciting the Pledge of 
Allegiance.

One involved Patriot biker, Rich ''Boomer'' Ford, a former Navy SEAL 
who served in Vietnam is the State Captain for the Texas Patriot Guard 
Riders. He is the man in charge of the ''missions''. If you ask Boomer 
why he rides, he will tell you that he remembers the lack of respect 
received when returning home from Vietnam. He wants to make sure that 
doesn't happen to these brave men and women. Boomer feels that each 
''mission'' recognizes and honors the hard work our soldiers are doing 
for us overseas. These men and women like Boomer, who volunteer their 
time to help guard our nation's heroes should be forever remembered for 
their honor and dignity.

I commend the Patriot Guard Riders for riding for our soldiers whose 
lives were given in pursuit of a great cause, American freedom. I am 
proud to recognize these angels on bikes with hearts bigger than Texas. 
They show their respect for our troops, their families, and our 
community in an honorable way, one funeral at a time. They make a 
difference and represent all that is right and good in America.

And that's just the way it is.
