Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor an American soldier who gave his life in service to our Nation.

Army Sergeant Marcus Mathes of Pasco County, Florida, was killed 
Monday, April 28th outside Baghdad, Iraq, when the equipment truck he 
was working on was struck by enemy rocket fire. Sergeant Mathes is 
survived by his mother and step-father, Sue and Mike Sawyer of Sebring, 
his father, Ralph Mathes of Tampa, and two brothers, Kyle Mathes of 
Illinois, and Zach Sawyer of Sebring.

A graduate of Zephyrhills High School, Sergeant Mathes grew up in 
Highlands County before moving to live with his father in Pasco County. 
While in high school, Sergeant Mathes joined the JROTC, and had dreams 
of being a professional military member. Inspired by the events of 
September 11, he enlisted in the Army and left for boot camp on his 
23rd birthday. Serving in Afghanistan from October 2006 until march 
2007, Sergeant Mathes was sent to Iraq in November of 2007.

A devoted family man, Sergeant. Mathes married his high school 
sweetheart Julia two weeks after her graduation. The two were planning 
to celebrate their six-year wedding anniversary this June and had 
wanted to start a family together. During a visit to his base in 
Louisiana, Sergeant Mathes introduced his sister-in-law, Julia's sister 
Heather, to one of his fellow soldiers. Two months later, Bryan Harvey 
and Heather were married. One of his best friends who served in his 
same unit, Bryan was nearby when Sergeant Mathes was killed, even 
picking up his torn Bible where it was thrown from the truck.

Madam Speaker, it is soldiers like Sergeant Marcus Mathes who have 
volunteered to protect the freedoms that all Americans hold dear. While 
brave men and women like Marcus have perished in the name of freedom 
and liberty, his family, friends and loved ones should know that this 
Congress will never forget his sacrifice and commitment.
