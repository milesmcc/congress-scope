`Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado â€” 25 May 2010`

Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, there are many heroes from 
Colorado who have fought and continue to fight in the global war on 
terror. Today, I rise to pay tribute to one hero in particular: United 
States Army Specialist Grant Wichmann of Golden, Colorado.

Specialist Grant Wichmann graduated from Golden High School, where he 
was an athlete, avid soccer player, and a snowboarder. Although one of 
his friends had been killed serving in Iraq, at the age of 24 he 
enlisted in the United States Army. When his father tried to talk him 
out of enlisting, Specialist Grant Wichmann said he could not sit by 
while others die protecting him. This is a true indication of the kind 
of courage Grant Wichmann possessed.

On March 12, 2010, while assigned to combat outpost Bari Alai, 
Afghanistan, Specialist Grant Wichmann's unit was attacked by enemy 
forces using small arms fire. During the engagement, Specialist Grant 
Wichmann was gravely wounded and ultimately succumbed to his injuries 
while at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

Specialist Grant Wichmann is a shining example of the United States 
Army service and sacrifice. As a former member of the United States 
Army and as a retired Marine Corps Reserve officer, my deepest 
sympathies go out to his family and all who knew him.
