Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.

Mr. Speaker, this continuing resolution is designed to keep the 
government open and running. We have an obligation to do this. We've 
got enough problems in the economy right now without adding to 
uncertainty. The Senate passed this continuing resolution by a vote of 
69-30. The House ought to pass it. It is a relatively straightforward 
and unadorned CR which simply keeps the government open for 64 days.

As far as the funding levels are concerned, in total this CR is a bit 
below what was enacted in 2010. The CR allows agencies to continue 
fiscal 2010


levels, with three exceptions. First, it provides additional funding 
for the National Nuclear Security Administration at the President's 
requested level of $7 billion. This is for weapons security, included 
at the request of Senate Republicans. Second, the CR provides less 
funding for the Census and Defense BRAC activities because less is 
needed for 2011. Third, the CR provides funding equal to last year's 
security assistance for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and the State 
Department operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This exception is needed 
because some of last year's funding was provided in the 2009 
supplemental. It also extends a number of authorizations that would 
otherwise expire, such as TANF. It also extends higher mortgage loan 
limits, stop-loss payments to our troops, and other programs.

Frankly, I had hoped that this CR would do a few other things, but 
the Senate would not accept them. For example, I had hoped that the CR 
would allow continuation of the emergency job program through which 37 
States provide subsidized jobs for nearly 250,000 otherwise unemployed 
parents and youth. The Senate would not allow this program to continue.

I urge an ''aye'' vote on the legislation. And I would simply note 
that, given the calendar, a vote against this proposition would be a 
vote to shut down the government.
