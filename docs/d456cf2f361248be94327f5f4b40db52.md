`Mr. McDERMOTT â€” 12 March 2008`

Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Chairman, the President's proposed budget can mean 
only one thing, the lights are on down at the White House but nobody's 
home. He has the House Republicans carrying the water, but their budget 
is his will,


make no mistake about it. If the President gets his way, lights will go 
off across America and people will suffer because of the President's 
complete disregard of the state of the economy, the plight of the 
American middle class and the domestic casualty from his irresponsible 
war in Iraq, that is, meeting the critical, unmet social needs of this 
country.

For instance, the President proposes slashing the Social Services 
Block Grant Program by $500 million this year and eliminating it 
altogether next year. In my home State of Washington, these funds are 
critical for providing child care for vulnerable families, Meals On 
Wheels and services to prevent child abuse.

But the President is more interested in helping the rich get richer 
and leaving the rest of America down and out. The President is willing 
to feed their greed by starving the U.S. economy and hurting the 
American people.

The American people deserve a budget that recognizes reality, and 
that's what the Democrats have offered. We provide tax relief to the 
middle class by demanding tax fairness for everyone. We include 
extended unemployment benefits, but I proposed a separate legislation 
this year because the American people expect their government to 
respond when an economic downturn hits and hurts them. They don't want 
any more New Orleans experiences.

We provide a budget based on reality, meeting the defense needs of 
the Nation, and meeting the unmet social needs of the American people.

In other words, the lights are on here, and the Democrats are home 
working for the American people.

The President has offered a budget that shouts it's all about funding 
a hopeless Iraq war while the Democrats have offered a budget that says 
it's about the economy and hope and help for the American people.

Vote for the American people and vote for the Democratic budget.
