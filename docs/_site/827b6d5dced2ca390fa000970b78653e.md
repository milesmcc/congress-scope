`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 18 January 2007`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, yesterday morning, January 17, a convoy 
carrying a staff member of the National Democratic Institute and 
members of her security team was ambushed in Baghdad.

Andrea Parhamovich, an American citizens, was killed. Three other NDI 
employees, citizens from Croatia, Hungary, and Iraq, also lost their 
lives in the attack.

Since June 2003, the National Democratic Institute has been working 
with Iraqi citizens, outside the Green Zone and at great risk, to help 
build the foundations on which a true democracy depends. I did not know 
Ms. Parhamovich, whose life was taken so tragically yesterday. But all 
of us recognize the ideals which inspired her to undertake such a 
dangerous mission for her country and the people of Iraq.

I offer my deepest respect and appreciation to her last true measure 
of devotion to democratic ideals. To her family, and the families of 
those who were also killed, I offer my deepest condolences.
