Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have filed amendment No. 670 to H.R. 
1591. This amendment authorizes the Secretary to spend up to $50 
million for the establishment and maintenance of a civilian reserve 
corps to address postconflict situations and other emergencies 
overseas. The amendment provides the Secretary the flexibility to use a 
portion of the funding in this act to make an urgent effort to recruit 
and train more civilians in planning and managing stabilization and 
reconstruction.

The Senate embraced the creation of such a civilian corps when it 
unanimously passed S. 3322 last May. The funding in this amendment 
matches the level provided in the House version of the emergency 
supplemental.

If enacted, this amendment provides the Secretary with access to 
immediate funding to recruit and send civilians with the appropriate 
skills to assist in reconstruction and stabilization in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, as well as to emerging trouble spots around the world. The 
United States must have the right structures, personnel, and resources 
in place when an emergency occurs. A delay in our response of a few 
weeks, or even days, can mean the difference between success and 
failure.

Both the State Department and the Defense Department are keenly aware 
of the importance of this amendment. They understand that, if we cannot 
work together better as a government in postconflict and other unstable 
situations, the United States may come to depend even more on our 
military for tasks and functions far beyond its current role. This 
amendment builds on the planning that has already taken place to 
develop a civilian reserve and jumpstarts it so that it can be 
available as soon as possible.

Mr. President, I would like to have printed in the Record at this 
point a letter from the Secretary of State strongly endorsing the need 
for the funding contained in this amendment.
