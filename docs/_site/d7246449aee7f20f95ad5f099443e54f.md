`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 27 February 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I indicated to my good friend, the 
majority leader, yesterday, and I now reiterate publicly, our desire to 
go to the measure reported by the Committee on Homeland Security. I 
think we will be able to work that out in the next few hours. We have 
also had a good conversation about how to structure a debate on Iraq to 
follow the 9/11 bill. There are a number of important amendments that 
Members on this side of the aisle want to offer to the 9/11 bill.

The majority leader has indicated there will be no desire on his 
part, and reiterated it here this morning, to prevent any of those 
amendments from being acted upon. So we expect a freewheeling, Senate-
style debate on the
9/11 bill in which a number of important amendments related to the 
measure are offered. I think we will be able to work out a way to go 
forward in the next few hours that will accommodate our mutual desire 
to have the right bill before the Senate regarding 9/11, and, 
hopefully, sometime shortly thereafter some kind of agreement to 
structure the debate on Iraq in a way that will be mutually acceptable 
to both sides of the aisle.
