Mr. REID. I have great admiration for the Agriculture Committee for 
getting a bill out of that committee on a bipartisan basis. There are 
people who want very badly to try to improve this bill, but nothing 
will be done. It is Tuesday. We have this bridge thing coming, dealing 
with the Iraq war, tomorrow. Time is wasting. I am beginning to have my 
doubts, I say to everyone here, because of the intransigence of the 
Republicans, that we can do a farm bill.
