`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 23 May 2007`

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I announce 
to the Senate today that SPC David W. Behrle has lost his life in Iraq. 
David Behrle died in the service of his country, and it is absolutely 
appropriate that we take this opportunity to salute his patriotism and 
his sacrifice.

Specialist Behrle died Saturday night, May 19, 2007, after his patrol 
vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb south of Baghdad. My thoughts, 
prayers, and sincere condolences go out to his mother, Dixie Pelzer of 
Tipton, IA, and his father, John Behrle of Columbus, NE, as well as the 
Tipton community that is now dealing with the loss of their second 
native son in Iraq. While we try to prepare ourselves for the loss of 
life that comes with war, it is impossible to prepare for the very 
personal experience of losing a young life so close to home. David is 
best described by a former classmate as ''not only our class president, 
he's now our class hero.'' He served his country with vigor and 
enthusiasm, and his presence will be missed in both Tipton and our 
Armed Forces.
