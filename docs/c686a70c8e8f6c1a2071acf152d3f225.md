Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Speaker, after what I thought was a 
successful attempt to cast my vote supporting the H.R. 2346, the War 
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009, I learned the next day my vote 
was not recorded.

I fully support this year's war supplemental. Whether serving in the 
Army, Navy, Marines, or Air Force, the men and women who serve are key 
enablers in fighting the Global War on Terror. It's important we give 
them, and their families, what they need to continue their success in 
Iraq and Afghanistan as well as at home.

As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am committed to 
doing everything I can to protecting our nation and communities. I am 
working to protect and expand the role of Fairchild Air Force Base, 
including securing the next generation of air refueling tankers.

I could not be more proud of the veterans, active duty and military 
families who call Eastern Washington home. I thank them for their 
service and am committed to doing everything I can to support them.
