Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for that. I believe I understand the 
point that you just made that the procedure there certainly was a 
procedure that, frankly, we could have spent a lot of time debating. By 
doing that, we could have slowed down this pay increase, and I think we 
wisely did not do that.

I suppose that if the greater issue of individuals that were harmed 
by the Saddam Hussein regime comes to the floor, we can debate that at 
the time. And I just would suggest right now, if there was some way to 
reach the personal or family assets of Saddam Hussein, that is one 
thing. I think we hamper the efforts of this new government if we 
continue to hold the new government responsible for whatever bad things 
a government did that was virtually universally held in the lowest 
possible regard by the Congress. And I think we are universally glad 
that government is gone, no matter how we feel about the other issues 
in Iraq. I think that is really the point at the end of this one part 
of that debate. The government is gone. I suppose we can debate that. I 
think the arrangement we made in the bill handles other countries 
appropriately and also gives the President the proper waiver authority 
for dealing with this new situation in Iraq. But I suppose today is 
also not the day to debate that, unless my friend wants to comment on 
that.
