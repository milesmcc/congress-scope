Mr. GOODE. Mr. Chairman, I too want to salute the gentleman from New 
York and his work on the Armed Forces Committee, but I must 
respectfully disagree with this amendment and what I believe is the 
philosophy behind it.

We need to be encouraging Iraqis to stay in Iraq. Iraq is improving. 
The situation there is expanding. They need to rebuild Iraq. They need 
to have a better economy. And by encouraging the best and the brightest 
to come to this country, we are doing a disservice. We should not be 
encouraging the Iraqi translators to abandon their country, to leave 
their country. We should be promoting their staying in Iraq.

If we have jobs programs, I suggest that first, with the mandatory 
language that exists in this amendment, that we focus on jobs for U.S. 
citizens. Refugees get food stamps, SSI and Medicaid. That is often 
more than U.S. citizens get. We should be rolling out the red carpet 
for our citizens first, instead of adopting programs like this.
