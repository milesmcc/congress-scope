`Mr. ENGEL â€” 15 December 2010`

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the success of the United States military 
depends on the hard work, dedication, and sacrifices of our brave men 
and women in uniform. And yet, under Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the talents 
and contributions of our openly gay and lesbian servicemembers are 
ignored. This is discrimination, plain and simple, and should not 
stand. What should count is the performance and competence of a member 
of our armed services, nothing else.

More than nine years after the 9/11 attacks, at a time when troops 
are being withdrawn from Iraq and increased in Afghanistan, our gay and 
lesbian servicemembers offer invaluable skills that enhance our 
country's military competence and readiness. According to the Service 
Members Legal Defense Network, more than 14,000 servicemembers have 
been discharged under DADT since 1994. This number includes almost 800 
mission-critical troops and nearly 60 Arabic linguists in just the last 
five years. That is indefensible. And to make matters worse, the 
financial cost of implementing Don't Ask, Don't Tell from Fiscal Year 
1994-2008 was more than $555 million.

Mr. Speaker, Don't Ask, Don't Tell weakens our national security, 
diminishes our military readiness, and violates fundamental American 
principles of fairness, integrity and equality.

We must end this pernicious law, and we must end it now.
