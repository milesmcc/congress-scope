Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, my concern with this supplemental is that it 
is designed to fail.

In section 1904, funding for the Iraqi security forces will be cut if 
the new government does not pass a constitutional amendment to 
''promote reconciliation,'' whatever that is, to ethnic groups, I 
suppose. In short, to amend the Constitution in a way that is not 
defined in a period that cannot be completed.

Now, earlier on this floor, Representative Conyers stated that it 
would take 10 years to pass an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to 
protect D.C. voting rights, and yet we expect Iraqis to pass a 
constitutional amendment to fix ethnic tensions in 6 months, not to 
mention the other tough challenges imposed by this bill.

This supplemental is like a promise written in disappearing ink: it 
is designed to fail.

During World War II, the Japanese stole blueprints of some U.S. 
submarines. They built a submarine, but when it launched, it turned 
upside down and sunk because it was designed to fail.

This substitute is designed to fail. It is designed to fail because 
it is going to defund the Iraqi security forces which are our best hope 
of success. Of all of the blood and the sweat and the tears that has 
been spilled in the desert of Iraq, is this how it is going to end, by 
a bill that is designed to fail by not funding the Iraqi security 
forces?

The trouble with the submarine, Mr. Speaker, is that my son and the 
sons and daughters of Americans across this Nation are inside. We 
cannot allow this substitute to pass because it is designed inherently 
to fail.
