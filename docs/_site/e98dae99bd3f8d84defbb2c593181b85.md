`Mrs. FEINSTEIN â€” 14 February 2007`

---


Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise with Senator Leahy, Senator 
Sanders, and Senator Mikulski to introduce legislation to address the 
continuing threat posed by cluster bombs to innocent civilians around 
the world.

Our legislation places common sense restrictions on the use of 
cluster bombs. It prevents any funds from being spent to use, sell or 
transfer cluster munitions: that have a failure rate of more than one 
percent; unless the rules of engagement or the agreement applicable to 
the sale or transfer of such cluster munitions specify that: the 
cluster munitions will only be used against clearly defined military 
targets and; will not be used where civilians are known to be present 
or in areas normally inhabited by civilians.

The bill also requires the President to submit a report to the 
appropriate Congressional committees on the plan, including estimated 
costs, by either the United States Government or the government to 
which U.S. cluster bombs are sold or transferred to clean up unexploded 
cluster bombs.

Finally, the bill includes a national security waiver that allows the 
President to waive the prohibition on the use, sale, or transfer of 
cluster bombs with a failure rate of more than one percent, if he 
determines it is vital to protect the security of the United States.

The human death toll and injury from these weapons are felt everyday. 
Innocent children think they are picking up a play toy in the field and 
suddenly their arm is blown off.

Last November, the International Committee for the Red Cross called 
for a ban on the use of cluster bombs in highly populated areas. They 
joined other leading organizations who have also decried the 
indiscriminate use of these weapons: Amnesty International, Human 
Rights Watch, the Friends Committee on National Legislation,


Handicap International, and Landmine Action.

Several countries, including Belgium, Germany, and Norway have either 
instituted a ban or a moratorium on the use and procurement of cluster 
bombs. More than 30 countries are actively calling for increased 
international controls on the weapon.

And next week, Norway will host an international conference to 
explore the possibility of a international treaty to ban certain types 
of cluster munitions and provide support for the victims of the 
weapons.

We need to adjust our policies for their use and can do so easily.

Every year, hundreds of civilians are killed and many more are 
injured due to unexploded cluster bombs.

From the fields of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, through the streets 
of Kosovo and Iraq, to the arid hills of Afghanistan and the 
playgrounds of Lebanon, these lethal relics of war continue to cripple 
life, hope, and peace.

Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that 
contain up to hundreds of small submunitions, or individual 
''bomblets.''

They are intended for attacking enemy troop formations and armor 
covering over a half mile radius.

Yet, in practice, they pose a real threat to the safety of civilians 
when used in populated areas because they leave hundreds of unexploded 
bombs over a very large area and they are often inaccurate.

The non-profit group Handicap International studied the effects of 
cluster bombs in 24 countries and regions, including Afghanistan, 
Chechnya, Laos, and Lebanon.

Its report found that civilians make up 98 percent of those killed or 
injured by cluster bombs. 27 percent of the casualties are children.

As the report shows, cluster bombs end up in streets and cities where 
men and women go to work and do their shopping.

They end up in groves of trees and fields where children play.

They end up in homes where families live.

In some cases, up to 40 percent of cluster bombs fail to explode, 
posing a particular danger to civilians long after the conflict has 
ended.

This is particularly and sadly true of children because bomblets are 
no bigger than a D battery and in some cases resemble a tennis ball.

Children, outside with their friends and relatives, come across these 
cluster bombs, pick them up because they look a ball, and start playing 
with them.

A terrible result often follows as these stories demonstrate.

On March 25, 2003 Abdallah Yaqoob was sleeping in his bed in his 
family's home in Basra, Iraq when he was hit by shrapnel from a cluster 
munition strike that hit his neighborhood.

He lost his arm, and his abdomen was severely injured. Abdallah was 
hit by British L20A1/M85 munition.

Falah Hassan, 13, was injured by an unexploded ground-launched 
submunition in Iraq on March 26, 2003.

The explosion severed his right hand and spread shrapnel through his 
body. He lost his left index finger and soft tissue in his lower limbs.

Hassan Hammade, a 13 year old Lebanese boy, lost four fingers and 
sustained injuries to his stomach and shoulder after he picked up an 
unexploded cluster bomb in front of an orange tree.

He said, ''I started playing with it and it blew up. I didn't know it 
was a cluster bomb--it just looked like a burned out piece of metal.''

All the children are too scared to go out now, we just play on the 
main roads or in our homes.

These unexploded cluster bombs become, in essence, de facto 
landmines.

Instead of targeting troop formations and enemy armor, unexploded 
bomblets target innocent civilians, seriously maiming or killing their 
victims.

This runs counter to our values and counter to the laws of war.

Make no mistake, the impact of unexploded cluster bombs on civilian 
populations has been devastating.

In Laos alone there are between 9 and 27 million unexploded cluster 
bombs, leftovers from U.S. bombing campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s.

killed or injured since the war ended. Source: International Committee 
for the Red Cross.

In the first Gulf War, 61,000 cluster bombs were used containing 20 
million bomblets. Since 1991, unexploded bomblets have killed 1,600 
innocent men, women, and children and injured more than 2,500.

In Afghanistan in 2001, 1,228 cluster bombs with 248,056 bomblets 
were used. Between October 2001 and November 2002, 127 civilians were 
killed by them, 70 percent of them under the age of 18.

In Iraq in 2003, 13,000 cluster bombs with nearly 2 million bomblets 
were used. Combining the first and second Gulf Wars, the total number 
of unexploded bomblets in the region is approximately 1.2 million.

What gives rise, in part, to my bill are recent developments in 
Lebanon over alleged use of cluster bombs by Israel.

It is estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets in southern 
Lebanon and 1 million of these bomblets failed to explode.

As Lebanese children and families have returned to their homes and 
begin to rebuild, they have been exposed to the danger of these 
unexploded bomblets lying in the rubble.

22 people, including six children have been killed and 133, including 
47 children, injured.

One United Nations official estimates that 40 percent of the cluster 
bombs launched by Israel in Southern Lebanon failed to explode.

So far, more than 58,000 unexploded bomblets in Lebanon have been 
destroyed but it will take 12 to 15 months to complete the effort.

Looking at these figures it is clear that several countries are awash 
with unexploded bomblets.

The number is indeed staggering and the consequences are real.

Each death that results from an unexploded American bomblet weakens 
American diplomacy and American values.

How are we supposed to win the hearts and minds of civilians in these 
countries when we leave behind such deadly weapons that 
indiscriminately kill boys and girls?

How are we supposed to speed up reconstruction efforts--building 
homes, schools, hospitals, clinics, and ensuring electricity and water 
supplies--when populated areas are littered with these bombs?

Simply put, unexploded cluster bombs fuel anger and resentment and 
make security, stabilization, and reconstruction efforts that much 
harder.

And it is not just a humanitarian problem, it is a military problem.

By showering targets with cluster bombs, we ensure that our troops 
will face thousands of unexploded bomblets as they move forward.

This will force them to change course and slow the mission.

During the Iraq war, U.S. troops would fire six rockets containing 
4,000 bomblets to eliminate one artillery piece in a civilian 
neighborhood. With a 16 percent dud rate, approximately 640 duds were 
left behind. Source: Human Rights Watch.

As an August 2003 Wall Street Journal article noted: ''Unexploded 
bomblets render significant swaths of battlefield off-limits to 
advancing U.S. troops.''

In fact, during the first Gulf War, unexploded cluster munitions 
killed 22 U.S. troops--6 percent of total U.S. fatalities--and injured 
58.

Former Secretary of Defense William Cohen recognized the threat 
cluster bombs posed to civilians and U.S. troops alike and issued a 
memorandum which became known as the Cohen Policy.

It stated that beginning in fiscal year 2005, all new cluster bomb 
would have a failure rate of less than one percent.

This was an important step forward but we must remember that we still 
have 5.5 million cluster bombs in our arsenals containing 728.5 million 
bomblets. That is, we are still prepared to use an enormous amount of 
cluster bombs that have significant failure rates. That is 
unacceptable.

Let me be clear. While this legislation prohibits the sale, use, or 
transfer of cluster bombs with a failure rate of more than one percent, 
it does include a national security waiver to allow the President to 
waive the restriction.



Instead of exercising the waiver, I would hope that administration 
would work with Congress to extend the Cohen Policy to the entire U.S. 
cluster bomb arsenal.

During the 1990s, a comprehensive pact was forged to protect 
civilians from land mines worldwide. The United States and the 
international community have since spent millions to remove mines in 
post-conflict regions.

There is no question there should be a similar program for cluster 
bombs.

Simply put, this legislation will save lives--civilians and soldiers 
alike--and will help save the reputation of the United States.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
