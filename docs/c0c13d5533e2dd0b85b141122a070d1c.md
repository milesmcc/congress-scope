Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to 
Army Specialist Russell Madden from Bellevue, Kentucky, who lost his 
life on June 23, 2010, in a rocket-propelled grenade attack on an Army 
convoy in the Charkh district of Afghanistan.

He was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment, 173rd 
Airborne Brigade Combat Team, Conn Barracks, Germany.

Specialist Madden joined the Army in 2008 and is a 2000 graduate of 
Bellevue High School.

In addition to being an outstanding father to his two sons, Parker 
and Jared, Russell was a model citizen. Not only did he serve our 
country abroad, he was also committed to his community as a local youth 
peewee football coach. He was also a dedicated husband to his wife, 
Michelle.

According to his troop commander, Captain Matt Booth, the officers 
and fellow soldiers could always rely on his courageous attitude to 
make things happen when times were tough and was known as someone who 
would never leave his buddies in a bad situation.


Today, as we celebrate the life and accomplishments of this 
exceptional Kentuckian, my thoughts and prayers are with Russell 
Madden's family and friends. We're deeply indebted to Specialist Madden 
and his family for their service and his sacrifice.
