Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the Senator from 
Michigan for her support and for her statement as well.

At this point, I want to turn to the majority leader. I am delighted 
that he has joined me on this amendment and has been such a strong 
leader over the many months since the election in trying to end this 
war in Iraq. I thank him for his courage and his leadership, and I 
yield him 10 minutes.
