Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for 
yielding the time.

You know, Pakistan and Afghanistan are very difficult parts of the 
world. As we develop the strategies, I think many of us have the same 
goals and objectives in mind, but we need to take a look at exactly 
what we're doing today.

I'm proud to support the Republican amendment to the Pakistan 
Enduring Assistance and Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2009. 
Interestingly, I believe that this substitute supports our current 
President's direction that he has outlined for Pakistan and 
Afghanistan. It supports President Obama's strategy to address the 
situation in Pakistan, to restore peace and stability to that region.

Maybe, once again, this is another foreign policy initiative where 
President Obama has decided that perhaps following some of the 
direction outlined under the Bush administration may not be a bad idea.

I'm one of many Republican ranking members to come forward today to 
express concern about the majority's bill and to urge support for the 
Republican substitute. The Democratic bill places too many restrictions 
on the ability of the President's advisors and the U.S. military to 
conduct diplomacy and military operations in the region.

In a letter to the Armed Services Committee, Secretary of Defense 
Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mullen raised their 
concern about the majority's bill, noting that ''The degree of 
conditionality and limitations on security assistance to Pakistan'' in 
H.R. 1886 ''severely constrains the flexibility necessary for the 
executive branch and the Department of Defense given the fluid and 
dynamic environment that exists in Pakistan.''

But obviously, they're saying, our troops in Afghanistan and the 
military in Pakistan and our support of the military efforts in 
Pakistan require more flexibility than what this bill will allow.

From intelligence briefings, I understand how volatile the situation 
is in Pakistan. Just on Tuesday, there was a hotel bombing, 18 people 
killed. The Pakistan Army has been engaged in a battle in the Swat 
Valley against Taliban militants. Any legislation on Pakistan must give 
the administration both flexibility to react to the fast-paced 
developments and the opportunity to develop a plan on how it will 
implement its strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Instead of flexibility, this bill is full of restrictive and 
intrusive provisions that I'm not sure we'd even apply to the United 
States, where the Democrat majority is trying to dictate and 
micromanage the President's administration's Pakistan policy. Their 
bill even includes language to increase Pakistani teacher salaries. It 
goes into the detail of the level of assistance for student meals.

Wow. That doesn't sound like we're giving the Paks a whole lot of 
flexibility to even run their own country. This down-in-the-weeds 
language may represent a new low for congressional micromanagement, not 
to mention a distraction from the crucial issue of bringing peace and 
stability to the region.

We need to defeat al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan. That is our 
goal. That is our mission. This Congress shouldn't be dictating to the 
Pakistanis teacher salaries and the level of assistance that it needs 
to provide students for meals in Pakistan.

Republicans have been unfairly criticized in the press as being the 
party of ''no.'' Not only are the Republicans being the party of 
''yes'' on this bill, we're also being more supportive of the Obama 
administration's Pakistan policy than the Democrat majority.

We support President Obama's efforts in the region. We want them to 
succeed. I believe the Republican amendment presents the best way 
Congress can ensure and move toward success in Pakistan and, at the 
same time, make sure that we stay united on foreign policy, because 
this amendment, this substitute supports the President's Pakistan 
strategy.

So let's stand with the President. Let's move forward. Let's make 
sure that we're united, Republicans and Democrats, House, Senate and 
the administration, in supporting this President's direction for 
Pakistan.

I ask my colleagues to support the Republican substitute.
