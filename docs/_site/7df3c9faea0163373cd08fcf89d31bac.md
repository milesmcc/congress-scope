Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I submit the following for the Record:

Requesting Member: Congressman Charles W. Dent.

Bill Number: H.R. 2638, Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, 
and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009.

Account: Operation and Maintenance, Army.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: ProModel Corporation.

Address of Requesting Entity: 7540 Windsor Drive, Suite 300, 
Allentown, PA 18195.

Description of Request: $2,000,000 is included to accelerate the 
deployment and enhance the current capabilities of the ProModel Army 
Force Generation Synchronization Tool (AST). This technology enables 
the Army to capture the Army Force Generation Model (ARFORGEN) process 
in software, providing decision makers the ability to rapidly create 
Courses of Action and predict the impact of their decisions on key 
metrics such as Dwell and Boots on Ground. The ability through 
automation to run ''what ifs'' to assess risk on readiness is 
recognized as a key priority for the Army and Joint Forces.

Requesting Member: Congressman Charles W. Dent.

Bill Number: H.R. 2638, Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, 
and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009.

Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE), Army.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

Address of Requesting Entity: 7201 Hamilton Boulevard, Allentown, PA 
18195.

Description of Request: $3,200,000 for Ballistic Armor Research to 
evaluate the emerging role of polymers as an active and/or passive 
component of armor systems will enable the next generation of 
protection for military personnel. While the federal government has 
supported the installation of new armor systems, materials selection 
remains limited, and the fundamental understanding of how to improve 
system performance and quickly deploy new armor systems in the field is 
not well developed. This project partners industry with a strategic 
university to conduct research under the leadership of the U.S. Army 
Research Lab to develop polymers and materials that will provide 
functional armor solutions to DOD. Army programs will directly benefit 
from the research through its ability to rapidly screen materials and 
determine their protection value, and understand how materials undergo 
physical and chemical changes during blast and impact.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Edmund Optics, Inc.

Address of Requesting Entity: 601 Montgomery Avenue, Pennsburg, PA 
18073.

Description of Request: $2,320,000 is included to advance Precision 
Molding Manufacturing Technology for Infrared Aspheric Optics. Infrared 
imaging technology is integrated in missile guidance, airborne 
reconnaissance, and situation awareness for soldiers, police, and fire 
fighters. It presents the only viable solution for sight in total 
darkness, dense fog and smoke. This technology enables the armed forces 
to detect and identify threats, then engage and defeat the enemy at a 
safe distance. Production techniques for aspheric optics have 
limitations, as current solutions are either low-cost or high-
performance but not both. Similarly, aspheres in thermal applications 
are produced using expensive machining techniques and costly raw 
materials. Molding, an alternative production technique, is the only 
feasible means to generate cost-effective precision infrared aspheric 
lenses. It is critical to shift infrared optics production from 
expensive machining to cost-effective precision molding.

Wide.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Lehigh University.

Address of Requesting Entity: 27 Memorial Drive West, Bethlehem, PA 
18015.

Description of Request: $1,600,000 for Document Analysis and 
Exploitation to develop and disseminate efficient technologies to 
extract information of importance from scanned document images 
regardless of the condition of the document and across a variety of key 
languages. As part of DARPA's newly-initiated MADCAT program 
(Multilingual Automatic Document Classification Analysis and 
Translation), new document analysis techniques and systems focused on 
processing Arabic handwriting are being developed. Currently, resources 
are underutilized because many documents exist only in hardcopy form 
and are often written in a foreign language using a non-Roman-script 
such as Arabic, Chinese (Kanji) or Korean (Hangul). This project will 
reduce errors in translation, help identify which documents need to be 
reviewed, and clear the massive backlog of captured documents from Iraq 
and Afghanistan that may have intelligence value.

Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE), Navy.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Curtiss-Wright Corporation, 
Engineered Pump Division.

Address of Requesting Entity: 222 Cameron Drive, Suite 200, 
Phillipsburg, NJ 08865.

Description of Request: $1,000,000 for the Landing Craft Composite 
Lift Fan project which will support design, development and domestic 
manufacture of prototype composite material lift fans for application 
on current and next generation Navy landing craft vessels. This 
initiative addresses a persistent problem the Navy has been having with 
current generation metal lift fans, which are now replaced on average 
about every 2-4 months due to corrosion, wear and tear. Utilization of 
this composite material technology in current and future generation 
landing craft lift fans would result in maintenance savings and will 
increase the ship availability, critical in an ever-decreasing fleet 
budget.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Neuromonics, Inc.

Address of Requesting Entity: 2810 Emrick Boulevard, Bethlehem, PA 
18020.

Description of Request: $1,000,000 is included to support the Chronic 
Tinnitus Treatment Program, a breakthrough tinnitus treatment device 
(patented, FDA-cleared, and non-military clinically-tested) and program 
that is designed to interact, interrupt, and desensitize tinnitus 
disturbance for long-term benefit, especially in those suffering with 
chronic and severe tinnitus. The treatment program combines the use of 
acoustic stimulation with a structured program of counseling. The Army 
reports that tinnitus is among the top medical complaints of soldiers 
returning from OIF/OEF, particularly given the high incidence of 
Traumatic Brain Injury/mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI/mTBI). Until 
recently, no effective treatment program has existed to help 
individuals suffering with the effects of tinnitus. This funding will 
allow military researchers to implement the chronic tinnitus treatment 
program and develop important baseline data to determine the 
effectiveness, usefulness, and long-term benefit of the program for 
military servicemembers suffering with tinnitus.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: International Battery, Inc.

Address of Requesting Entity: 6845 Snowdrift Road, Allentown, PA 
18106.

Description of Request: $2,400,000 is included for the Lithium Ion 
Battery Exchange Program to demonstrate the increased capability of the 
Lithium Ion 6TLi Battery as opposed to the current lead acid battery in 
the Army Theater of Operation. The 6TLi Battery Exchange Program will 
provide added capability of four times the energy, half the weight, a 
significantly longer life and enhanced combat readiness as compared to 
the current lead acid battery. The 6TLi battery has been engineered to 
the same dimensions of the current lead acid battery, allowing soldiers 
in the field to perform seemless exchanges. Additionally, the battery 
provides no hazardous material such as lead or acid, which limits major 
disposal charges.
