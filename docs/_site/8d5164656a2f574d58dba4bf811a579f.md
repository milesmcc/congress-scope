Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my 
colleague Senator Kohl, to reintroduce this important piece of 
legislation. This legislation will work to ensure the United States 
government does not turn its back on political asylees or refugees who 
are the most vulnerable citizens seeking safety in this great country 
of ours.

As many of you know, Congress modified the Supplemental Security 
Income (SSI) program to include seven-year time limit on the receipt of 
benefits for refugees and asylees. This policy was intended to balance 
the desire to have people who emigrate to the United States to become 
citizens, with an understanding that the naturalization process also 
takes time to complete. To allow adequate time for asylees and refugees 
to become naturalized citizens, Congress provided the seven-year time 
limit before the expiration of SSI benefits.

Unfortunately, the naturalization process often takes longer than 
seven years. Applicants are required to live in the United States for a 
minimum of five years prior to applying for citizenship. In addition to 
that time period, their application process often can take three or 
more years before resolution. Because of this time delay, many 
individuals are trapped in the system faced with the loss of their SSI 
benefits.

Many of these individuals are elderly who fled persecution or torture 
in their home countries. They include Jews fleeing religious 
persecution in the former Soviet Union, Iraqi Kurds fleeing the Saddam 
Hussein regime, Cubans and Hmong people from the highlands of Laos who 
served on the side of the United States military during the Vietnam 
War. They are elderly and unable to work, and have become reliant on 
their SSI benefits as their primary income. To penalize them because of 
delays encountered through the bureaucratic process seems unjust and 
inappropriate.

The administration in its fiscal year 2008 budget acknowledged the 
necessity to correct this problem by dedicating funding to extend 
refugee eligibility for SSI beyond the seven-year limit. While I am 
pleased that they have taken the first step in correcting this problem, 
I am concerned the policy does not go far enough. Data shows that most 
people will need at least an additional two years to navigate and 
complete the naturalization process. Therefore, my colleagues and I 
have introduced this bill, which will provide a two-year extension. We 
believe this will provide the time necessary to complete the process.

I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill, and I look 
forward to working with Chairman Baucus and other members of the 
Finance Committee to secure these changes.

I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the 
Record.
