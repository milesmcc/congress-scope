# RECOGNIZING SUCCESS

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, our new strategy in Iraq 
is working. Just last week, General David Petraeus, commander of the 
coalition forces in Iraq, gave his first briefing regarding the 
situation on the ground. Specifically, General Petraeus reported that 
the Iraqis are fulfilling their obligations, having sent 10 Army 
brigades and nine police brigades into Baghdad.

The Iraqi Government has unshackled U.S. forces, allowing them to 
target both Shiite and Sunni militias. Numerous weapons reserves have 
been uncovered, car bomb factories have been destroyed, and top al 
Qaeda members have been captured. Unfortunately, too many of my 
colleagues refuse to acknowledge these successes. Some have lost sight 
of the most important factor, achieving victory. Al Qaeda spokesman 
Zawahiri has declared Iraq and Afghanistan the central front in the 
global war on terrorism. As the parent of an Iraqi service veteran, I 
know we must win to protect American families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
