# THE IRAQ EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL
## `5c7c6d71846aa18d54379ffc063c6518`
`Ms. SUTTON â€” 1 May 2007`

Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, the American people have demanded a new 
direction in Iraq, and last week this Congress voted to put an end to 
the administration's failed stay-the-course policy.

The President should support our troops and sign this responsible 
bill instead of issuing veto threats that continue to ignore the 
reality of our troops' being caught in the middle of a civil war. It is 
ironic that we are expecting the President to veto this bill to bring 
our troops home 4 years to the day after he declared the job done in 
Iraq. It is time for accountability from the administration and from 
the Iraqi Government.

Our bill provides what the American people are demanding and what our 
troops need: a responsible policy that funds our troops, demands 
accountability from the administration and the Iraqi Government, and 
supports our veterans.

The President should listen to Congress. Sign this bill, take the 
funding, and accept accountability.
