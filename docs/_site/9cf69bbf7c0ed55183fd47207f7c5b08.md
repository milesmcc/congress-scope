# PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2346,  SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009

Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from 
California (Mr. Dreier) for yielding the time.

As the ranking member on Armed Services, I rise in opposition to this 
rule and to the war supplemental conference report for one simple 
reason. It will endanger our troops in harm's way. Compared with the 
clean troop funding bill that passed the House with bipartisan support 
in May, this package cuts $4.7 billion from defense that we passed at 
that time to create room for a $105 billion global bailout loan 
program.

What should be a clean military funding bill has become a means for 
the President's promise to provide more foreign aid to the 
International Monetary Fund. Those funds will eventually make their way 
to countries that are less than friendly to the United States at the 
expense of programs to support our troops. And even more disturbing is 
the decision by conferees to reject the motion offered by Republicans 
to prohibit the release of detainee photos that could exacerbate 
tensions in the very regions our troops are fighting.

Mr. Speaker, let me read to you a statement about those photos by 
General Petraeus, commander of U.S. Armed Forces throughout the Middle 
East:

''The release of images depicting U.S. servicemen mistreating 
detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan, or that could be construed as 
depicting mistreatment, would likely deal a particularly hard blow to 
U.S. CENTCOM and U.S. interagency counterinsurgency efforts in these 
key nations, as well as further endanger the lives of U.S. soldiers, 
marines, airmen, sailors, civilians and contractors presently serving 
there.''

General Petraeus is correct, and we should stand with our troops in 
the field and prohibit the release of these photos. We should not leave 
it in the hands of ACLU lawyers or at the mercy of activist judges.

I urge my colleagues to reject this package and insist that it be 
brought back immediately with Senator Lieberman and Senator Graham's 
language to prohibit release of these photos.

Finally, the Senate-passed troop bill included language prohibiting 
release or transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. soil. 
Unfortunately this conference report does not prohibit the transfer or 
release of detainees after October 1 of this year. This is a huge 
mistake. I fear we're already beginning to open Pandora's box. We've 
already begun importing terrorists. These Guantanamo detainees are 
trained to foment dissent among Americans, and we should do everything 
possible to keep them away from our local military bases and our 
prisons.

Again, I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on this rule and the 
conference report so we can quickly make these necessary changes to 
protect our troops in the field and bring back a clean troop funding 
bill.
