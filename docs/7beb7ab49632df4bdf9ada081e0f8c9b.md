Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5740, the 
Post 9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Act--bipartisan legislation 
that honors our men and women in uniform and strengthens our military.

Since World War II, our nation has offered education benefits to 
returning GIs. The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, the first GI 
Bill, which was passed unanimously by this House, paid for the tuition, 
books, fees, training costs, and even a monthly stipend for our 
returning veterans.

After World War II, nearly 8 million veterans, out of a wartime 
veteran population of 15 million, used the original GI Bill to earn an 
education. The economic return was unprecedented. For every dollar we 
spent on the GI Bill, we generated 7 more into our national economy. 
Millions of newly-educated veterans led our Nation in business and 
innovation and created the American middle class. It's no wonder the GI 
Bill of 1944 is regarded as one of the most successful pieces of 
legislation to earn this House's approval in the 20th Century.

Since that time, Congress has passed other GI bills, but over time, 
the value of the education benefit has declined. The current Montgomery 
GI Bill, for example, was designed for peacetime service, and is not 
meeting the needs of our newest generation of veterans, many of whom 
are returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Our veterans--whether active duty, Reservists or National Guardsmen--
deserve an education benefit that accounts for the stress of war and 
keeps up with the rapidly increasing cost of a higher education. That 
is why, with the backing of a broad, bipartisan coalition, I introduced 
H.R. 5740, the Post-9/l1 Veterans Educational Assistance Act.

Under the legislation, GIs returning from Iraq or Afghanistan would 
receive up to four academic years of education benefits, including 
stipends for housing and books. They can even use their benefits at 
private schools through the Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement 
Program, in which the federal government will match, dollar for dollar, 
any voluntary additional contributions to veterans from institutions 
whose tuition is more expensive than the maximum educational assistance 
provided under this legislation.

Veterans would even have up to 15 years after they leave active duty 
to use their education benefits. I am pleased that this bill was 
included as part of the emergency war funding measure that the House is 
considering today because I believe taking care of those who serve in 
war is a cost of war. America should never fight wars without taking 
care of our own. However, I am deeply troubled by how we got to this 
point, and am disappointed that this issue has become politicized.

When I was elected to this House, my constituents asked me to work in 
a bipartisan way to find reasonable solutions to our common problems. 
And that is what I tried to do with this GI Bill. Working together with 
my Democratic and Republican colleagues, we attracted more than two-
thirds of the House as cosponsors. Ninety-two Republicans, nearly half 
of the minority party's membership, lent their support. But instead of 
using that coalition to secure overdue educational benefits for our 
veterans, our leadership has allowed ideological gotcha games to 
prevail.

What began as an attempt to fix a broken promise to our veterans has 
devolved into a fight over who can score the most political points. As 
a result, instead of sending a veto-proof bill to the Senate, we are 
sending a lesser bill with a less certain outcome. This does not hurt 
any of our political opponents, Mr. Speaker; it only hurts our 
veterans. And, frankly, they deserve better. Our soldiers and veterans 
deserve a House whose actions matches its rhetoric. If we mean what we 
say, that taking care of those who serve is truly a cost of war, then 
the GI Bill should be included as a part of our war spending.

I was astonished yesterday when, amidst all the platitudes some 
members of this chamber made about the need for the GI Bill to meet


pay-go rules, those very same members were so willing to throw those 
rules out the door when it came to the Farm Bill. Wealthy farmers were 
given greater consideration than our veterans.

I strongly disagree with leadership's decision to raise taxes on the 
backs of our veterans, and I believe it is wrong that I wasn't given an 
opportunity to offer an amendment to strip this from the bill. I will 
do everything in my power to encourage the Senate to fix this 
legislation. However, in order to get the GI Bill to the Senate, and 
give it any chance to pass, I am forced to vote for the deeply flawed 
package before me today.

Our veterans have fought for us. The least we can do is fight for 
them.
