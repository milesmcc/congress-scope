Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, in past State of the Union addresses, the 
President has promised the American people that he will strengthen 
America's security. Unfortunately, his policies have made the world 
more dangerous and America less safe. Now he wants to escalate the war 
in Iraq, despite the overwhelming opposition of the American people and 
many of his own generals.

After years of insisting we ''stay the course'' in Iraq, the 
President has finally decided to make a change. Unfortunately, it is 
one that puts more Americans in danger and further compromises our 
security here at home. There is no doubt that the war in Iraq was the 
defining issue during last year's election. Americans overwhelmingly 
voted in favor of a change in course, but not the one now proposed by 
President Bush.

Madam Speaker, tonight President Bush has a chance to show he has 
listened to the American people, his own generals, and Democratic and 
Republican Members of Congress.
