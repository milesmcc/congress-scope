Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying it is obviously 
up to us, as Senators. We are the ones who have the right and the 
responsibility and the privilege to take up the types of matters we are 
taking up today. It is up to us to do the due diligence, to have the 
intelligence briefings, to look at our nuclear posture reviews, to look 
at what this treaty itself says, and to look at what our force 
structure is. That is our responsibility. It is up to each of us, the 
100 of us in this body, to decide whether we ratify this treaty. But I 
think it is also at least interesting to get input from others.


One of the things our side of the aisle likes to do is we like to 
listen to military leaders and what they have to say about issues 
relating to the war--Afghanistan or Iraq--and certainly the issue of 
how we enter into nuclear treaties with other countries.

I will ask to have printed in the Record a letter to Senator Kerry 
from the Joint Chiefs of Staff talking about their firm commitment for 
the START treaty on the basis that it increases our national security.

I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter 
dated December 20 from ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs.
