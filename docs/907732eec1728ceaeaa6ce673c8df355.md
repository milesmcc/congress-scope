Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I believe that Congress should continue 
to encourage an open and robust debate about the threat from radical 
jihadists. I found the following report in the Sunday Times of 
particular interest. I would like to share it with my colleagues.

 Saudi Arabia Is Hub of World Terror: The Desert Kingdom Supplies the 













Cash and the Killers










(By Nick Fielding and Sarah Baxter)




 It was an occasion for tears and celebration as the Knights 


 of Martyrdom proclaimed on video: ''Our brother Turki fell 


 during the rays of dawn, covered in blood after he was hit by 


 the bullets of the infidels, following in the path of his 


 brother.'' The flowery language could not disguise the brutal 


 truth that a Saudi family had lost two sons fighting for Al-


 Qaeda in Iraq.



 The elder brother, Khaled, had been a deputy commander of a 


 crack jihadist ''special forces'' unit. After his 


 ''glorious'' death, Turki took his place.



 ''He was deeply affected by the martyrdom of his brother,'' 


 the Knights said. ''He became more ambitious and more 


 passionate about defending the land of Islam and dying as a 


 martyr, like his brother.''



 Turki's fervent wish was granted earlier this year, but 


 another Saudi national who travelled to Iraq had second 


 thoughts. He was a graduate from a respectable family of 


 teachers and professors who was recruited in a Saudi Arabian 


 mosque and sent to Iraq with $1,000 in travel expenses and 


 the telephone number of a smuggler who could get him across 


 the Syrian border.



 In Iraq he was ordered to blow himself up in a tanker on a 


 bridge in Ramadi, but he panicked before he could press the 


 detonator. He was arrested by Iraqi police. In a second 


 lorry, another foreign fighter followed orders and died.



 King Abdullah was surprised during his two-day state visit 


 to Britain last week by the barrage of criticism directed at 


 the Saudi kingdom. Officials were in ''considerable shock'', 


 one former British diplomat said.



 Back home the king is regarded as a modest reformer who has 


 cracked down on home- grown terrorism and loosened a few 


 relatively minor restrictions on his subjects' personal 


 freedom.



 With oil prices surging, Saudi Arabia is growing in 


 prosperity and embracing some modern trappings. Bibles and 


 crucifixes are still banned, but internet access is spreading 


 and there are plans for ''Mile High Tower'', the world's 


 tallest skyscraper, in Jeddah. As a key ally of the West, the 


 king had every reason to expect a warm welcome.



 Yet wealthy Saudis remain the chief financiers of worldwide 


 terror networks. ''If I could somehow snap my fingers and cut 


 off the funding from one country, it would be Saudi Arabia,'' 


 said Stuart Levey. the U.S. Treasury official in charge of 


 tracking tenor financing.



 Extremist clerics provide a stream of recruits to some of 


 the world's nastiest trouble spots.



 An analysis by NBC News suggested that the Saudis make up 


 55% of foreign fighters in Iraq. They are also among the most 


 uncompromising and militant.



 Half the foreign fighters held by the U.S. at Camp Cropper 


 near Baghdad are Saudis. They are kept in yellow jumpsuits in 


 a separate, windowless compound after they attempted to 


 impose sharia on the other detainees and preached an extreme 


 form of Wahhabist Islam.



 In recent months, Saudi religious scholars have caused 


 consternation in Iraq and Iran by issuing fatwas calling for 


 the destruction of the great Shi'ite shrines in Najaf and 


 Karbala in Iraq, some of which have already been bombed. And 


 while prominent members of the ruling al-Saud dynasty 


 regularly express their abhorrence of terrorism, leading 


 figures within the kingdom who advocate extremism are 


 tolerated.



 Sheikh Saleh al-Luhaidan, the chief justice, who oversees 


 terrorist trials, was recorded on tape in a mosque in 2004, 


 encouraging young men to fight in Iraq. ''Entering Iraq has 


 become risky now,'' he cautioned. ''It requires avoiding 


 those evil satellites and those drone aircraft, which own 


 every corner of the skies over Iraq. If someone knows that he 


 is capable of entering Iraq in order to join the fight, and 


 if his intention is to raise up the word of God, then he is 


 free to do so.''



 The Bush administration is split over how to deal with the 


 Saudi threat, with the State Department warning against 


 pressure that might lead the royal family to fall and be 


 replaced by more dangerous extremists.



 ''The urban legend is that George Bush and Dick Cheney are 


 close to the Saudis because of oil and their past ties with 


 them, but they're pretty disillusioned with them,'' said 


 Stephen Schwartz, of the Centre for Islamic Pluralism in 


 Washington. ''The problem is that the Saudis have been part 


 of American policy for so long that it's not easy to work out 


 a solution.''



 According to Levey, not one person identified by America or 


 the United Nations as a terrorist financier has been 


 prosecuted by Saudi authorities. A fortnight ago exasperated 


 U.S. Treasury officials named three Saudi citizens as 


 terrorist financiers. ''In order to deter other would-be 


 donors, it is important to hold these terrorists publicly 


 accountable.'' Levey said.



 All three had worked in the Philippines, where they are 


 alleged to have helped to finance the Abu Sayyaf group, an 


 Al-Qaeda affiliate. One, Muham-mad Sughayr, was said to be 


 the main link between Abu Sayyaf and wealthy Gulf donors.



 Sughayr was arrested in the Philippines in 2005 and swiftly 


 deported to Saudi Arabia after pressure from the Saudi 


 embassy in Manila. There is no evidence that he was 


 prosecuted on his return home.



 This year the Saudis arrested 10 people thought to be 


 terrorist financiers, but the excitement faded when their 


 defense lawyers claimed that they were political dissidents 


 and human rights groups took up their cause.



 Matthew Levitt, a former intelligence analyst at the US 


 Treasury and counter-terrorism expert at the Washington 


 Institute for Near East Policy, believes the Saudis could do 


 more. He said: ''It is important for the Saudis to hold 


 people publicly accountable. Key financiers have built up 


 considerable personal wealth and are loath to put that at 


 risk. There is some evidence that individuals who have been 


 outed have curtailed their financial activities.''



 In the past the Saudis openly supported Islamic militants. 


 Osama Bin Laden was originally treated as a favourite son of 


 the regime and feted as a hero for fighting the Soviets in 


 Afghanistan. Huge charitable organisations such as the 


 International Islamic Relief Organisation and the al-Haramain 


 Foundation--accused in American court documents of having 


 links to extremist groups--flourished, sometimes with 


 patronage from senior Saudi royals.



 The 1991 Gulf war was a wake-up call for the Saudis. Bin 


 Laden began making vitriolic attacks on the Saudi royal 


 family for cooperating with the U.S. and demanded the 


 expulsion of foreign troops from Arabia. His citizenship was 


 revoked in 1994. The 1996 attack on the Khobar Towers in 


 Dhahran, which killed 19 U.S. servicemen and one Saudi, was a 


 warning that he could strike within the kingdom.



 As long as foreigners were the principal targets, the 


 Saudis turned a blind eye to terror. Even the September 11 


 attacks of 2001, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, 


 could not shake their complacency. Despite promises to crack 


 down on radical imams, Saudi mosques continued to preach 


 hatred of America.



 The mood began to change in 2003 and 2004, when Al-Qaeda 


 mounted a series of terrorist attacks within the kingdom that 


 threatened to become an insurgency. ''They finally 


 acknowledged at the highest levels that they had a problem 


 and it was coming for them,'' said Rachel Bronson, the author 


 of Thicker than Oil: America's Uneasy Partnership with 


 Saudi Arabia.



 Assassination attempts against security officials caused 


 some of the royals to fear for their own safety. In May 2004 


 Islamic terrorists struck two oil industry installations and 


 a foreigners' housing compound in Khobar, taking 50 hostages 


 and killing 22 of them.



 The Saudi authorities began to cooperate more with the FBI, 


 clamp down on extremist charities. monitor mosques and keep a 


 watchful eye on fighters returning from Iraq.



 Only last month Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul-Aziz al-Sheikh, 


 the kingdom's leading cleric, criticised gullible Saudis for 


 becoming ''convenient knights for whoever wants to exploit 


 their zeal, even to the point of turning them into walking 


 bombs''.



 And last week in London, King Abdullah warned young British 


 Muslims not to become involved with extremists.



 Yet the Saudis' ambivalence towards terrorism has not gone 


 away. Money for foreign fighters and terror groups still 


 pours out of the kingdom, but it now tends to be carried in 


 cash by couriers rather than sent through the wires, where it 


 can be stopped and identified more easily.



 A National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad, a 


 nongovernmental organisation that was intended to regulate 


 private aid abroad to guard against terrorist financing, has 


 still not been created three years after it was trumpeted by 


 the Saudi embassy in Washington.



 Hundreds of Islamic militants have been arrested but many 


 have been released after undergoing reeducation programmes 


 led by Muslim clerics.



 According to the daily Alwa-tan, the interior ministry has 


 given 115m riyals (14.7m) to detainees and their 


 families to help them to repay debts, to assist families with 


 health care and housing, to pay for weddings and to buy a car 


 on their release. The most needy prisoners' families receive 


 2,000-3,000 riyals (286 to 384) a 


 month.



 Ali Sa'd AI-Mussa, a lecturer at King Khaled University in 


 Abha, protested: ''I'm afraid that holding [extremist] views 


 leads to earning a prize or, worse, a steady income.''



 Former detainees from the U.S. military prison at 


 Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are also benefiting. To celebrate the 


 Muslim holiday of Eid, 55 prisoners were temporarily released 


 last month and given the equivalent of 1,300 each 


 to spend with their families.



 School textbooks still teach the Protocols of the Elders of 


 Zion. A notorious antiSemitic forgery, and preach hatred 


 towards Christians, Jews and other religions, including 


 Shi'ite Muslims, who are considered heretics.



 Ali al-Ahmed, director of the Washington-based Institute 


 for Gulf Affairs, said: ''The Saudi education system has over 


 5m children using these books. If only one in 1,000 take 


 these teachings to heart and seek to act on them violently, 


 there will be 5,000 terrorists.''



 In frustration, Arlen Specter. the Republican senator for 


 Pennsylvania, introduced the Saudi Arabia Accountability Act 


 10 days ago, calling for strong encouragement of the Saudi 


 government to ''end its support for institutions that fund, 


 train, incite, encourage or in any other way aid and abet 


 terrorism''.





 The act, however, is expected to die when it reaches the 


 Senate foreign relations committee: the Bush administration 


 is counting on Saudi Arabia to help stabilise Iraq, curtail 


 Iran's nuclear and regional ambitions and give a push to the 


 Israeli and Palestinian peace process at a conference due to 


 be held this month in Annapolis, Maryland.



 ''Do we really want to take on the Saudis at the moment?'' 


 asks Bronson. ''We've got enough problems as it is.''
