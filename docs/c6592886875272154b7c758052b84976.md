Mr. REID. I am going to try to work with the minority leader to see 
what we can work out as to whether we want to have the Iraq votes 
intertwined with Defense authorization or whether we do not. I have 
Members telling me on the Defense authorization bill that they are 
going to offer an amendment to close Guantanamo and offer habeas 
corpus, so it is going to be a contested piece of legislation. We have 
to complete that.

There are some who believe we would be better off having the Iraq 
matters separate and apart from Defense authorization. I have to work 
that out first with Senators Levin and McCain. My initial report from 
them is that they would rather have them separate, but I will work with 
the minority leader and we will try to finish deciding what we are 
going to do by Wednesday or Thursday of this week.
