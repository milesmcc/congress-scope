`Mr. INHOFE â€” 8 April 2008`

---


Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, having returned a few days ago from my 
14th trip in the area, I think it is particularly meaningful to 
remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army Staff 
Sergeant Christopher Hake. Chris died on the 23rd of March, 2008, of 
injuries he sustained when an IED detonated near his Bradley fighting 
vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq.

Chris grew up in Enid, OK, with two sisters, Shannon and Keri, and 
two brothers, Zachary and Skylar. I was in Enid yesterday. I looked 
around and I could see the area, the type of place where Chris grew up. 
He spent his time, as most Oklahoma boys did, attending school, playing 
ball, driving his car, spending time with family and friends, and going 
to church. His strong faith in Jesus matured during his time at 
Oklahoma Bible Academy. While there, he became very involved in his 
youth group and traveled to Mexico on a mission trip. Unsure of what he 
wanted to do after graduating from Oklahoma Bible Academy, Chris 
enlisted in the Army in 2000.

Chris excelled during basic training in Fort Benning and was selected 
to serve as a member of the ''Old Guard''--one of the oldest and most 
respected infantry regiments in the U.S. Army. As a member of the Old 
Guard, Chris was responsible for guarding the Tomb of the Unknowns at 
Arlington National Cemetery and escorting deceased Army servicemembers 
to their final rest in the ''Garden of Stone,'' as Arlington is 
sometimes called. While serving in the Old Guard unit, the Pentagon was 
attacked on September 11. Chris was immediately called upon to clear 
the Pentagon after the attack. This solidified Chris's commitment to 
the fight for freedom in the world and to protect the people of 
America. He saw that opportunity in Iraq.

In 2004, Chris transferred to the 4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment, 
4th Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, GA. 
While home during the summer of 2004, he met Kelli Short and it was 
love at first sight. They married on 21 December 2004, and Chris 
deployed on his first Iraq tour in January.

Chris was disillusioned after his first tour, feeling many of the 
decisions being made back in DC were negatively impacting their ability 
to accomplish the mission. I know this is true because I talked to the 
troops when I was over there on the 14 trips I have made. As we speak, 
in the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Petraeus is telling us 
the truth about what is happening over there.

Chris returned to Fort Stewart after his year in Iraq, and on October 
14, 2006, Kelli gave birth to Gage Christopher Michael Hake.

Chris was both a loving husband and a proud father. His focus and 
love was his family--spending time with them, playing games with them, 
sitting for hours just to be with them, working on their house 
together.

Chris returned to Iraq on his second tour in October of 2007. He 
fought back his emotions as he said goodbye to his 1-year-old son, but 
he knew what he had to do and why. He loved serving his country. Once 
in Iraq again, Chris saw a difference in the mission and what was 
happening with the Iraqi people.

During his second tour, Chris said he knew he should be there and 
talked of the love of the Iraqi people for him and the troops. Pete 
Hake, Chris's father, remembered him saying: ''You couldn't pay me to 
come home early.'' That is the kind of dedication Chris and so many 
others have.

On Easter Sunday, March 23, 2008, Chris Hake tragically died of 
injuries he sustained when an IED detonated near his vehicle in 
Baghdad. Three other soldiers of his battalion and under his command 
were killed alongside Chris. Chris's father recounted that Chris had 
said, ''They would die for each other,'' and they did. They gave the 
ultimate sacrifice in serving their country.

In a recent e-mail to his mom and dad, he said he wanted to dedicate 
his second tour in Iraq to becoming a closer follower of Jesus. Chris 
wrote:




 If anything were to happen to me, Gage would always be able 


 to know that his father died so he could live in peace. I 


 know Jesus did the same for me, so it is comforting. I don't 


 have a nervous bone in my body this time. I am more at peace 


 than I have been my whole life.


On March 31, Chris returned to Oklahoma and was greeted by an honor 
guard from Fort Sill, members of the Patriot Guard Riders motorcycle 
group, Airmen from Vance Air Force Base, and a mass of fellow 
Oklahomans to honor this American hero. It was obvious he held the 
respect of so many, and he was a beloved son, father, and husband.

I read through some of the comments written in Chris's online guest 
book, and I would like to share a few of these with you:




 Thank you for your sacrifice--my children will know what 


 men like you have done for them.



 I am the mom of a soldier serving in Iraq and just wanted 


 to tell you how proud I am of your son, husband, and daddy.



 Know that 1st Squad will always maintain and exceed the 


 standards you have set. We miss you.



 I read through all of the entries and cried. I hope it is 


 comforting to know that there are so many of us praying for 


 you.



 John 15:13--Greater love has no one than this, that he lay 


 down his life for his friends.



 The ''Spartans'' will keep you close to our hearts forever 


 in time.



 Thank you for being my son. Thank you for Gage, a little 


 copy of you. Thank you for fighting and making a stand. 


 Goodbye, my son, my baby boy, my U.S. soldier, my pride and 


 joy.


Today, we remember Staff Sergeant Chris Hake, a young man who loved 
his


family and loved his country. Chris was doing the Lord's work, and the 
Lord is richly blessing him now.

I yield the floor.
