`Mr. LARSON of Connecticut â€” 23 March 2007`

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit this 
letter from Connecticut Governor Rell for the Record. This letter to 
Chairman Skelton echoes the sentiment that has been debated in this 
Chamber and reaffirms why the bill before us today is so important. As 
we move forward with a new direction in Iraq, we must address the 
readiness of our military; we must provide the necessary support and 
equipment to our troops--this includes the National Guard in 
Connecticut and across the country.























 State of Connecticut,

 Hon. Ike Skelton,


 Chairman, House Armed Services Committee,


 Washington, DC,


 Hon. Duncan Hunter,


 Ranking Member, House Armed Services Committee, Washington,
