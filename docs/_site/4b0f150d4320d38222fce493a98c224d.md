Mr. REID. Did the Senator hear me when I said we have asked for an 
agreement that the only amendments that will be offered on this bill 
are relating to housing? Is he aware that they said no deal? And is the 
Senator aware that Senator Durbin had offered an amendment at 
approximately 10 o'clock this morning, and there have only been four 
speakers, with not long speeches, and that we are not voting because of 
the speeches, because they are gone? Is the Senator aware that I said: 
Okay, how about voting on a resolution offered by the Senator from 
Massachusetts that honors the lives of 4,000 Americans who have been 
killed in Iraq? Is he aware that we could not get a vote on that?
