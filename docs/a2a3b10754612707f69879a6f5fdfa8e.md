Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-
Senate amendment on a weapons system that is critical to the U.S. Air 
Force from an intelligence gathering standpoint. It has to do with the 
re-engining of the Joint STARS weapons system. Real-time intelligence 
is critical to our warfighters in fighting the ongoing wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, just as in all other military conflicts. Secretary Gates 
and our military leadership have consistently highlighted to us the 
importance of collecting and disseminating critical intelligence and 
battlefield information to our troops on the ground and theaters of 
conflict, such as Iraq and Afghanistan.

One of the most effective ISR assets operating today is the Air 
Force's E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, also known 
as Joint STARS, or more succinctly, JSTARS.

I ask unanimous consent a memorandum signed yesterday from Ashton 
Carter, Under Secretary of Defense, addressing JSTARS be printed in the 
Record at the conclusion of my remarks.

The PRESIDING officer. Without objection, it is so ordered.

(See Exhibit 1.)
