affordable precision guided weapon. Phase II to begin September 2008 
will study best material approach, conops and system architecture 
refinement, and a comprehensive risk assessment leading to a preferred 
system concept with a flyaway cost of less than $250 thousand. The 
results from the Phase I and Phase II study will support the

Description of Request: The Navy's need for a secure non-RF 
alternative to radio communication is well known. The need arises from 
operational scenarios, such as Underway Replenishment, where vessels 
are unable to use radios due to RF jammers, EMCON conditions, the 
presence of IEDs, and the need for a secure communication system that 
has a low probability of interception and detection. $400,000 to the IR 
LED Free Space Optics Communications Advancement program will allow the 
program to advance LightSpeed technology, which is a proven, tested and 
fielded technology based on IR LED Free Space Optics (FSO) concepts. 
The funding will enable the advancement of the technology's size, 
weight, power, distance and bandwidth for the Navy's use in Special 
Operations and general services communities.
