Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, does anybody realize there's a war going on out 
there in the desert sands of Iraq and the rough mountains of 
Afghanistan? Apparently not, or Congress would be taking care of our 
troops.

Mr. Speaker, the troops will be out of funds to carry the fight to 
the enemy by the end of June. So where's the money?

Spending money is what Congress does. Why hasn't this body provided 
the funds for our troops and equipment and for more personnel?

This is an emergency. Delaying will put our troops at risk. We should 
authorize the funds now; send equipment now and, if needed, send more 
troops.

The American people expect our military to do their duty. Well, the 
American people expect us to do ours as well.

Congress needs to quit talking about supporting the troops and put 
money where our mouths seem to be.

Nathan Bedford Forrest, successful Confederate general, said it best 
about winning and victory and the means to do so. He said: ''Get there 
firstest with the mostest.''

Congress needs to send the generals the mostest, Mr. Speaker, needs 
to send equipment and personnel that is needed. Doing this will help 
our mission in spite of the Congressional Surrender Group's desire to 
retreat and quit.

And that's just the way it is.
