Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, Specialist Matthew Bolar, 24, 
of Montgomery, Alabama, died on May 3, 2007, in Baghdad, Iraq. 
Specialist Bolar was assigned to A Company, 1st Battalion, 501st 
Parachute Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, and was stationed 
at Fort Richardson, Alaska.

Specialist Bolar graduated from Canterbury High School in 2002 at the 
top of his class and joined the Army in 2004. His friends and family 
remember him as a bright young man eager to serve his country.

Words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family, and 
for the gratitude our country feels for his service. Specialist Bolar, 
like other brave men and women who have served in uniform, died serving 
not just the United States, but the entire cause of liberty. Indeed, 
like those who have served before him, he was a true American.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve our Nation.
