Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I wanted to speak today about the debate 
on the war. And I have the honor of representing Fort Stewart, home of 
the Third Infantry Division, which is located in Hinesville and 
Savannah, Georgia.

This month the Third Infantry will start its third deployment to 
Iraq. And as they go over there, certainly they know what is going on 
in Washington in terms of the debate. But I think it is real important 
that we don't send a signal to our men and women in harm's way that 
what they are doing is irrelevant, that we can't win, and that because 
Bush might be a President whose policies aren't perfect that we need to 
withdraw.

In fact, I think what we should do is reaffirm on a bipartisan basis 
that we support the troops. We want to get them all the up-armored 
vehicles that they need, the Cougars, for example, blue tracking, the 
advanced night vision goggles. We should say on a bipartisan basis, we 
want to give them absolutely all the military hardware that they need 
to win the war. And then, in a separate debate, have the discussion of 
what an alternative is, where is the plan of the Bush critics and what 
is the price of pulling out. And I think we need to make that 
statement. And I am glad Sam Johnson is moving in that direction.
