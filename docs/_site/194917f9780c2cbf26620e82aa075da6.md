Mr. McMAHON. Thank you, Congressman Boccieri for that passioned 
insight on this issue. And as you point out, I talked about the horrors 
of our energy dependence on the Middle Eastern countries here on 
foreign soil, on our domestic soil and through terrorism.

But certainly, we thank you for your service to our country. And also 
it's quite clear that the men and women who are wearing our uniforms 
right now fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are doing so, so much so 
because we can't get off our addiction to that foreign oil, 
particularly from the Mid East, and that's what this bill is about.

We'd like to hear from our equally great colleague from the great 
State of Maryland, Frank Kratovil.
