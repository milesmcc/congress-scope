## `584e0b07e20fe846b8ee939fffe76248`
`Mrs. LINCOLN â€” 22 April 2010`

 Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor National Guard 
Specialist Michelle Donovan, a resident of Hot Springs Village in my 
home State of Arkansas. Specialist Donovan recently received the Purple 
Heart for injuries she sustained while serving in Iraq nearly 3 years 
ago.

Specialist Donovan served as a combat medic assigned to the 875th 
Engineer Battalion, Arkansas National Guard. On August 21, 2007, while 
on patrol in Iraq, the vehicle in which she was riding struck an 
explosive device, leaving her and her four team members seriously 
wounded. She suffered severe traumatic brain injury and wounds to her 
leg and shoulder, as well as injuries to her face, requiring a medical 
discharge from the Arkansas National Guard.

Along with all Arkansans, I salute Specialist Donovan for her 
bravery, and I am grateful for her service and sacrifice.

More than 11,000 Arkansans on active duty and more than 10,000 
Arkansas reservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September 
11, 2001. It is the responsibility of our Nation to provide the tools 
necessary to care for our country's returning servicemembers and honor 
the commitment our Nation made when we sent them into harm's way. Our 
grateful Nation will not forget them when their military service is 
complete. It is the least we can do for those whom we owe so 
much.
