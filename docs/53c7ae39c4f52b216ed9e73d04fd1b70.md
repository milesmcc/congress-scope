# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `53c7ae39c4f52b216ed9e73d04fd1b70`
`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I certainly acknowledge the 
passion of the former speaker on the floor.

I would just say, though, that all of us have suffered casualties and 
deaths in our districts. Certainly a gentleman from my former district 
was killed last week. He was a graduate of Duke University. He was 
offered scholarships to law school. He was an All American lacrosse 
player, volunteered to serve in the Army, was in his third tour. His 
family more than ever supports the effort in Iraq, and you can find 
families on all sides.

I think it is wrong to somehow suggest that those who died, somehow 
the families want us to vote for this resolution or against it. We can 
find sufficient numbers on both sides. Certainly in my experience, most 
of those would oppose the resolution. I certainly would not impose that 
on anyone else.

Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
Turner), a distinguished member from the Armed Services Committee.
