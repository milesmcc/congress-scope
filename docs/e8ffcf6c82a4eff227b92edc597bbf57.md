Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Durbin's 
amendment.

The debate is not about an arcane, technical pension funding rule. 
The issue before us is about whether thousands and thousands of airline 
employees are allowed to keep hard-earned defined benefit pensions or 
if we are going to regulate them or throw them out to the underfunded 
PBGC, which has so much debt that you cannot count the zeros. This 
issue is about whether we are going to send additional major carriers, 
who have so far avoided bankruptcy in these brutal financial 
circumstances, into a downward spiral. My premise is to hold the main 
carriers harmless. They are up against it, at the cliff. We should hold 
them harmless.

Adding this pension provision to the FAA bill would defeat the whole 
purpose of this compromise brokered by the Finance and the Commerce 
Committees, which was done with the underlying principle that we should 
hold the commercial airlines harmless during these turbulent economic 
times, which are expected to last. That is sacred. That is why it would 
be unwise to load up an additional liability on airlines trying to do 
the right thing for their employees.

It would be especially wrong to cause that result in a misguided 
effort to put the preservation of regular order before common sense--in 
other words, going around a committee. It happens. Airline employees 
will pay the unnecessary price for this change from current law. It 
cannot happen.

During these tough times of rising fuel prices and mounting financial 
losses, this is not the time to impose tougher, unrealistic pension 
funding requirements upon the airline industry. To do so would risk 
more bankruptcies and force carriers to dump their pensions into the 
woebegone PBGC. That would put in danger the economic security of 
workers who would prefer to stay employed and not have their pensions 
frozen.

In 2005, when the Senate was considering the Pension Protection Act 
on the Senate floor, we passed an amendment by voice vote that I 
cosponsored with Senator Isakson and Senator Lott. The amendment would 
have given all airline carriers substantial pension relief. The 
amendment did not pick winners or losers within the airline industry. 
It is not our business. Rather, it focused on keeping their defined 
benefit pension plans solvent.

Unfortunately, as Senator Hutchison pointed out, the final product 
that came out of conference in 2006 limited the pension relief the 
Senate sought to give all airlines. Led by--and I will say he is gone 
and I am not sad--the Ways and Means Committee chairman, Bill Thomas, 
the conference report chose winners and losers. It gave some carriers 
more pension relief than others, creating a competitive advantage for 
some carriers.

A number of Senators were not happy with the airline provisions bill, 
including Senators Durbin, Reid, Obama, Harkin, Menendez, Lautenberg, 
Bill Nelson, and a lot of the rest of us. They entered a colloquy on 
the floor arguing that this disparity needed to be dealt with.

That is why in last year's Iraq war supplemental appropriations 
legislation Dick Durbin did the only thing that he had available to him 
to do, and with the strong support of Senator Hutchison, he sought to 
right this wrong and inserted a provision that brought the airlines up 
to par and gave them the necessary pension relief that they deserved. I 
understand this was perhaps not the best process. We are not a body 
known for our meticulous protocol. We are trying to get something in 
that is lifesaving for the Nation.

As a senior member of the Finance Committee myself, which has 
jurisdiction of pension legislation, I agree with Senator Baucus that 
it would have been more ideal to go through the regular order and have 
the Finance Committee review and vet the provision. The problem is that 
it wasn't going to happen.

However, airlines need and deserve pension relief. We cannot adopt 
the pension provision of the Finance Committee tax title and impose 
higher pension burdens upon five domestic airlines, which has been 
discussed by various people, during these tougher economic times.

Remember, hold legacy commercial airlines harmless. So we would be 
turning our backs on American, Continental, US Airways, Hawaiian, and 
Alaska Air. To do so would risk more bankruptcies and more job losses. 
I pointed out earlier that one out of every six jobs in the airline 
industry has been lost in the last 6 years.

In 2005, while we were debating the Isakson-Rockefeller-Lott 
amendment that brought all airlines equitable pension relief, I stated 
on the Senate floor that my goal was to protect the employees and 
retirees who worked so hard to earn retirement benefits, and that 
remains my goal today.

To deny disadvantaged airlines the relief they rightfully deserve in 
the Pension Protection Act and which the Senate voted to give them 
would be unfair.

I have the utmost respect for Senators Baucus and Grassley. They are 
a superb team. They did their very best and did a very good job on the 
whole on the Pension Protection Act. But the Finance Committee in the 
Senate should not have received the dicta of the now thoroughly retired 
former Ways and Means Committee chairman. The former House majority 
succeeded with their desperate efforts to achieve questionable policy 
goals by holding long-awaited pension reform legislation hostage. But 
that was then and


this is now, and we should not give the former House majority the 
satisfaction of achieving their desired objective over a jurisdictional 
squabble, and that is all it is. It counts. I understand that. It 
counts. People lie on the floor to protect it, but in this case, we are 
dealing with something much larger.

We can do better, and that must begin by us stepping back and 
invoking the ''do no harm'' principle. America cannot afford another 
major bankruptcy to cripple our aviation system.

With all of my respect to the Finance Committee leadership, we just 
cannot do one more thing to jeopardize the health of our domestic 
aviation industry, particularly the commercial sector. The rest of it 
is doing very well. For that reason, I will support Senator Durbin's 
amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

I yield the floor.
