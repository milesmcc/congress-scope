Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am not here for partisan reasons; I am 
here because men and women wearing the uniform of the United States who 
are gay and lesbian have died for this country because gay and lesbian 
men and women wear the uniform of this country and have their lives on 
the line right now in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places for this 
country. One of those is a captain by the name of Jonathan Hopkins. He 
finished fourth in his class at West Point, commanded two companies--
one in combat--and earned three Bronze Stars, including one for valor 
in combat. Yet that decorated combat leader had to leave the Army 
because of don't ask, don't tell. I am here because of SSgt Eric Alva, 
the first ground unit casualty of the war in Iraq. The first casualty 
in the war in Iraq was a gay soldier. The mine took off his right leg, 
and that mine that took off his right leg didn't give a darn whether he 
was gay or straight. We shouldn't either.

We cannot let these patriots down. Their suffering should end. It 
will end with the passage of this bill. I urge its passage today. It is 
the right thing to do.

I yield the floor.
