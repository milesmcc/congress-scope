Mr. SESSIONS. We really need to do this. We voted after a full debate 
this summer to give General Petraeus a chance, asked him to come back 
and report in September. We voted 80 to 14 to fund the surge, and 
General Petraeus came back with positive reports in September. But it 
was early. We were not sure what was going to be the true trend. Since 
September, the situation in Iraq has improved to a degree I did not 
expect possible. The casualties are down two-thirds from earlier in the 
summer. It appears al-Qaida is completely on the run. Great progress 
has been made. It is unthinkable at this point, after all we have been 
through, the difficult times we had this summer, when progress is being 
made clearly, indisputably, that we would now jerk the rug out from 
under our soldiers. We have to do this. We need Senator Reid to quit 
saying we are losing and quit saying this is not working, while our 
soldiers are making progress. How demoralizing is that?

I urge my colleagues to vote to support our troops at this critical 
point as we are making progress.
