Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I'd like to thank Congresswoman Waters for her 
statement.

For the Record, I have a statement from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice 
Johnson to be submitted for the Record.

Listen to these statistics. Of the percentage of persons serving in 
the military, 60 percent are white, 23 percent are African American, 10 
percent are Hispanic, 3 Asian American Pacific. Of those serving in the 
Navy, 62 percent are Caucasian, 19 percent are African American. Those 
serving in the Air Force, 72 percent are Caucasian, 15 percent are 
African American, in the Marine Corps, 66 percent are Caucasian, 12 are 
African American.

Let's look at the statistics with regard to deaths as a result of 
this Iraq war. Of the 3,734 who have been killed in this war, 40 are 
American Indian or Alaska Native, 69 Asian, 350 African Americans, 405 
Hispanic, Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 440.



Totally in 2007, Caucasian, a total of 3,734.

Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure at this point to yield to my 
colleague and good friend from the great State of Texas, Congresswoman 
Sheila Jackson-Lee.
