`Mr. BAYH â€” 16 October 2007`

---


Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep 
sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young sailor from Tell 
City. Shayna Ann Schnell, 19 years old, died on October 1 in Dubai, 
United Arab Emirates, from injuries she received in a vehicle accident 
several days earlier. With her entire life before her, Shayna risked 
everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, 
in a land halfway around the world.

Shayna was a lifelong Hoosier, growing up in Dubois and Perry 
counties. Shayna graduated Perry Central High School in 2006 and joined 
the Navy later that year. After completing basic training in Great 
Lakes, IL, Shayna was stationed at Lackland Air Force Base in San 
Antonio, TX. Her hard work earned her an assignment as a master-at-arms 
with the Naval Security Force Bahrain in the United Arab Emirates.

Shayna died while serving her country by supporting Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. She is survived by her mother and stepfather, Suzanne and 
Vernon Silacci; her father and stepmother, Doug and Peggy Schnell; her 
sister Nicole; and her brothers Trent and Tyler, who is also serving 
his country in the Navy. Shayna was known for her dedication to her 
family and her love of country. Today and always, she will be 
remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true 
American hero, and we honor the sacrifice she made while dutifully 
serving her country.

Today, I join Shayna's family and friends in mourning her death. 
While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take 
pride in the example she set, bravely fighting to make the world a 
safer place. It is her courage and strength of character that people 
will remember when they think of Shayna, a memory that will burn 
brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.

As I search for words to do justice in honoring Shayna's sacrifice, I 
am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families 
of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ''We cannot dedicate, we cannot 
consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and 
dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power 
to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we 
say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement 
is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain 
that the impact of Shayna's actions will live on far longer that any 
record of these words.

It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shayna Schnell in the official 
Record of the U.S. Senate for her service to this country and for her 
profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think 
about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain 
that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like 
Shayna's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said, 
''He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away 
tears from off all faces.''

May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be 
with all of you, as I know He is with Shayna.
