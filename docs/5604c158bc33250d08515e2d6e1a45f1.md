Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following any

of the House message on H.R. 2642, and there be 2 hours of debate 
equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their designees;

respect to the Reid motion to concur in House amendment No. 2 with an 
amendment be withdrawn, and the Reid second-degree amendment be 
withdrawn; that the Senate then proceed to vote on adoption of the 
motion to concur in House amendment No. 2 with an amendment; that the 
motion to concur be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold, that 
if the motion achieves that threshold, it be agreed to, and the motion 
to reconsider be laid upon the table; that if the motion to concur 
fails to achieve 60 votes, it be withdrawn, and Senator Reid be 
recognized to move to concur in House amendment No. 2 with an amendment
