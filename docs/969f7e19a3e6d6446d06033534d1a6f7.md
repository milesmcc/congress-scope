Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this bill and 
our need to make important technical corrections to the Higher 
Education Opportunity Act. I thank Senator Kennedy for his willingness 
to approach this bill in a bipartisan manner, I always believe that 
working together we produce a better policy.

Any time this body considers a bill that has over 1,000 pages, there 
is bound to be a need to do some ''clean up'' and to correct unintended 
consequences. Fortunately, we were also provided an opportunity to 
broaden benefits to the children who have lost a parent in either Iraq 
or Afghanistan since 2001. It is important that we do all we can to 
support these individuals whose families have made the ultimate 
sacrifice for our country. I am appreciative of Senators Burr and 
Alexander for their leadership in getting this bill done.

A college education is not a luxury in the 21st century economy. It 
is a necessity. This bill will improve the ability of our student 
assistance programs to function and meet the needs of institutions of 
higher education, students and their families.
