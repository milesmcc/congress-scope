Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to briefly thank and commend the 
Senator from Delaware for his ongoing leadership in a very critical 
area, and that is the area of federalism in Iraq. He has made it clear 
in his amendment, he has made it clear in his remarks that the 
federalism he is referring to is the federalism which the Iraqis have 
placed in their Constitution.
