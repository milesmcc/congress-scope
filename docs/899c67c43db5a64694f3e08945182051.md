`Mr. PRICE of Georgia â€” 21 March 2007`

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, many of us in this Chamber find 
it absolutely incomprehensible that there are those who believe that 
the best course of action in the face of a determined enemy is to tell 
that enemy that we are less than determined. Yet that is exactly what 
the Iraq supplemental financing bill does.

What message do we send our brave military men and women when we 
won't guarantee them the resources and equipment that they need without 
including a litany of restrictive and arbitrary timetables? What will 
our soldiers on the front lines of this war think when they hear that 
salmon fisheries and spinach growers are being used to buy votes?

This Iraq supplemental bill is just one more step in what has become 
a long list of unprecedented attempts by this majority to accept defeat 
at any cost. For those of us in Washington, we get to face this moment 
in the warmth and comfort of our homes and our offices. For so many 
Americans, they will face this moment in the harsh reality of a war 
zone. We must not forget what is at stake. Our military will not and 
the American people will not.
