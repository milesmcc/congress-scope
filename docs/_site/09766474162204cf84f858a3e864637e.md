Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as 
much time as I may consume.

I am pleased to rise in support of the bill that will pave the way 
for the Law Library at the Library of Congress to more fully serve this 
community, the legal community, academia and the public. The Law 
Library has one of the greatest collections of legal documents in the 
world, unparalleled in its breadth and depth.

The collection is so significant and diverse that following removing 
the Taliban from power in Afghanistan, as was suggested by my colleague 
from California, the Afghani people turned to the Library of Congress' 
archives to find a copy of the laws and Constitution of their country, 
Afghanistan.

Not much more than a year ago, in May 2008, a good friend and 
colleague of ours, the late Representative Bill Orton of Utah, appeared 
before the House Appropriations Committee and delivered compelling 
testimony toward the importance of properly funding this Law Library. 
It is, therefore, fitting that it is in his honor that we move this 
bill forward today.

Among Bill Orton's arguments for passionate support of the Law 
Library, perhaps two are most salient: the manner in which the current 
budgetary scheme forces the Library of Congress to balance the various 
departments against one another and the pressing need for an avenue to 
facilitate and dedicate private support for this Law Library. The 
American Bar Association, in a letter this month to the House of 
Representatives, echoed Bill Orton's testimony, explaining that the 
spreading of budgetary shortfalls has led at times to the neglect of 
particular portions of collections. For example, the ABA highlights the 
fact that the Law Library's loose leaf subscriptions are months out of 
date.

At the time of his testimony, Bill Orton appeared as a representative 
of the American Bar Association, which is dedicated and committed to 
specifically address the maintenance, accessibility and relevance of 
the Law Library. When pressed as to whether the legal community would 
pitch in as a partner in financially supporting the Law Library, his 
response was emphatically, Yes.

With the passage of this bill, we enable our partners in the legal 
community to fulfill that commitment, and we give them an avenue 
through which that can be done.



More personally, this bill serves as a tribute to our late colleague, 
Bill Orton. During his service in this body, he was a passionate 
advocate for the law library and its many resources. He recognized the 
value of the careful stewardship of the law library's institutional 
mission. And so I hope that with our vote today, we will move that much 
closer to seeing the goal of Bill Orton realized.

I urge my colleagues, therefore, to join me in supporting the memory 
of Bill Orton, the mission of the law library, and this bill.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
