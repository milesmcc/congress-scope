Mr. SHAYS. If the gentlewoman will yield further, you are making me 
more concerned rather than less by your honesty. Could I ask the 
gentlewoman to respond to her intent on how she will be looking to fund 
this issue? This is the one program that is in fact working in Iraq. No 
one disputes it. We can dispute everything else, but not this. My 
interest is what your intentions are in the future as it relates not to 
Iraq in general or military forces, but the CAP agency program?
