Mr. WARNER. For instance, the first finding:




 A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for 


 Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are 


 determined to attack the United States and United States 


 allies.


We know from experience in Afghanistan that bin Laden occupied a 
piece of territory there and set up his training camp. Much of the 
training that led to the horrific damage to our Nation, loss of life 
and property, occurred there--of course, September 11. Does the Senator 
not agree--I am curious, I would like to get some understanding of what 
the Senator's thoughts are on this sense of the Senate.
