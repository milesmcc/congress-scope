# VETERANS' MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER CARE IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2008
## `f7530b1c2b6f7bb21d87394a730386ce`
`Mr. FILNER â€” 24 September 2008`

---


Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I want to say to Congressman Buyer, the ranking 
member, and really all the Members on both the Republican and Democrat 
side of this committee, we have had some ups and downs in this year, 
but these two bills that we are doing today are great bills. I think 
we, and I say ''we'' meaning all of us, have a great deal to be proud 
of. We are going to touch millions of veterans with these bills, 
millions, and their families, and we are doing it on behalf of people 
that we know deserve no less.

We have traveled around the country. We have met thousands of 
veterans in different States. I think both of us get more and more 
impressed with both the newer veterans and the older veterans and what 
they have accomplished and how they have carried out their lives. So we 
are very proud to have worked together to produce these bills.

The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have prepared 
the following explanation of the compromise bill, S. 2162 (hereinafter 
referred to as the ''Compromise Agreement''). Differences between the 
provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the related 
provisions in the bills listed above are noted in this document, except 
for clerical corrections and conforming changes made necessary by the 
Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and clarifying 
changes.





Title I--Substance Use Disorders and Mental Health Care

Tribute to Justin Bailey (sec. 101)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 306) to specify that this 
title is enacted in tribute to Justin Bailey, who, after returning to 
the United States from service as member of the Armed Forces in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, died in a domiciliary facility of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs while receiving care for post-traumatic 
stress disorder and a substance use disorder.

Section 6 of the House bill contained the identical provision.



The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.

Findings on Substance Use Disorders and Mental Health (sec. 102)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 301) that would express 
the sense of the Congress that:

(1) More than 1,500,000 members of the Armed Forces have been 
deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The 
2005 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among 
Active Duty Personnel reports that 23 percent of members of the Armed 
Forces on active duty acknowledge a significant problem with alcohol 
use, with similar rates of acknowledged problems with alcohol use among 
members of the National Guard.

(2) The effects of substance abuse are wide ranging, including 
significantly increased risk of suicide, exacerbation of mental and 
physical health disorders, breakdown of family support, and increased 
risk of unemployment and homelessness.

(3) While veterans suffering from mental health conditions, chronic 
physical illness, and poly trauma may be at increased risk for 
development of a substance use disorder, treatment for these veterans 
is complicated by the need to address adequately the physical and 
mental symptoms associated with these conditions through appropriate 
medical intervention.

(4) While the Veterans Health Administration has dramatically 
increased health services for veterans from 1996 through 2006, the 
number of veterans receiving specialized substance abuse treatment 
services decreased 18 percent during that time. No comparable decrease 
in the national rate of substance abuse has been observed during that 
time.

(5) While some facilities of the Veterans Health Administration 
provide exemplary substance use disorder treatment services, the 
availability of such treatment services throughout the health care 
system of the Veterans Health Administration is inconsistent.

(6) According to the Government Accountability Office, the Department 
of Veterans Affairs significantly reduced its substance use disorder 
treatment and rehabilitation services between 1996 and 2006, and has 
made little progress since in restoring these services to their pre-
1996 levels.

The House bill contained no similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision but modifies 
finding (6) to include the year of the Government Accountability report 
and cites the National Mental Health Program Monitoring System report.

Expansion of Substance Use Disorder Treatment Services Provided by the 


Department of Veterans Affairs (sec. 103)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 302) that would require 
that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs ensure the provision of services 
and treatment to each veteran enrolled in the health care system of the 
Department who is in need of services and treatments for a substance 
use disorder, and the bill included a specific list of services. The 
Senate bill would also authorize that the services and treatments may 
be provided to a veteran: (1) at Department of Veterans Affairs medical 
centers or clinics; (2) by referral to other facilities of the 
Department that are accessible to such veteran; or (3) by contract or 
fee- for-service payments with community-based organizations for the 
provision of such services and treatments.

The House bill contained a similar provision (sec. 2) that would 
require the Secretary to provide a full continuum of care for substance 
use disorders to veterans in need of such care and included a specific 
list of services, including three services not included in the Senate 
bill: marital and family counseling, screening for substance use 
disorders, and coordination with groups providing peer to peer 
counseling. The House bill (sec. 3) would also require the Secretary to 
ensure that the amounts made available for care, treatment, and 
services are allocated evenly throughout the system, including an 
annual reporting requirement.

The Compromise Agreement includes the listing of substance use 
disorder services included in both the Senate and House bills, and 
follows the Senate bill with respect to the locations of where services 
would be provided. The Compromise Agreement follows the House bill with 
respect to ensuring the equitable distribution of resources for 
substance abuse services but does not include the annual reporting 
requirement.

Care for Veterans with Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders (sec. 


104)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 303) that would ensure 
that if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs provides a veteran inpatient 
or outpatient care for a substance use disorder and a comorbid mental 
health disorder, that the treatment for such disorders be provided 
concurrently: (1) through a service provided by a clinician or health 
professional who has training and expertise in treatment of substance 
use disorders and mental health disorders; (2) by separate substance 
use disorder and mental health disorder treatment services when there 
is appropriate coordination, collaboration, and care management between 
such treatment services; or (3) by a team of clinicians with 
appropriate expertise.

The House bill contained no similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.

Pilot Program for Internet-based Substance Use Disorder Treatment for 


Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom 


(sec. 105)


The House bill contained a provision (sec. 4) that would express the 
sense of the Congress that:

(1) Stigma associated with seeking treatment for mental health 
disorders has been demonstrated to prevent some veterans from seeking 
such treatment at a medical facility operated by the Department of 
Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs.

(2) There is a significant incidence among veterans of post-
deployment mental health problems, especially among members of a 
reserve component who return as veterans to civilian life.

(3) Computer-based self-guided training has been demonstrated to be 
an effective strategy for supplementing the care of psychological 
conditions.

(4) Younger veterans, especially those who served in Operation 
Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, are comfortable with and 
proficient at computer-based technology.

(5) Veterans living in rural areas find access to treatment for 
substance use disorder limited.

(6) Self-assessment and treatment options for substance use disorders 
through an Internet website may reduce stigma and provides additional 
access for individuals seeking care and treatment for such disorders.

This provision would also require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
to carry out a pilot program to test the feasibility and advisability 
of providing veterans who seek treatment for substance use disorders 
access to a computer-based self-assessment, education, and specified 
treatment program through a secure Internet website operated by the 
Secretary.

The Senate bill contained no similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.

Report on Residential Mental Health Care Facilities of the Veterans 


Health Administration (sec. 106)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 305) that would require 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, acting through the Office of Mental 
Health Services of the Department of Veterans Affairs, not later than 
six months after the date of the enactment of this Act, conduct a 
review of all residential mental health care facilities, including 
domiciliary facilities, of the Veterans Health Administration; and not 
later than two years after the date of the completion of the first 
review conduct a follow-up review of such facilities to evaluate any 
improvements made or problems remaining since the first review was 
completed. Not later than 90 days after the completion of the first 
review, the Secretary would be required to submit to the Committee on 
Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs 
of the House of Representatives a report on such review.

The House bill (sec. 5) contained a similar provision, except there 
was no provision for a two-year follow-up review, and the six-month 
review would be carried out by the Office of the Medical Inspector.

The Compromise Agreement includes the Senate provision which 
specifies the two-year follow-up review, but would have the Inspector 
General carry out the reviews.

Pilot Program on Peer Outreach and Support for Veterans and Use of 


Community Mental Health Centers and Indian Health Service 


Facilities (sec. 107)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 401) that would require 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to 
assess the feasibility and advisability of providing the following to 
veterans of OIF/OEF in at least two Veterans Integrated Service 
Networks: 1) peer outreach services; 2) peer support services provided 
by licensed providers of peer support services or veterans who have 
personal experience with mental illness; 3) readjustment counseling 
services; and other mental health services. Services would be provided 
through community mental health centers or other entities under 
contracts or other agreements and through the Indian Health Service 
pursuant to a memorandum of understanding entered into by the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Section 6 of H.R. 2874 required the Secretary to carry out a program 
to provide peer outreach services, peer support services, and 
readjustment and mental health services to covered veterans. This 
provision was not a pilot program and did not provide for the means to 
collaborate with the Indian Health Service.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision with an 
amendment that would authorize at least three pilot sites.












Title II--Mental Health Research

Research Program on Comorbid Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and 


Substance Use Disorders (sec. 201)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 501) that would require 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a program of research 
into comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use 
disorder. This research program shall be carried out by the National 
Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. In carrying out the program, 
the Center shall: 1) develop protocols and goals with respect to 
research under the program; and 2) coordinate research, data 
collection, and data dissemination under the program.

The House bill contained no similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.

Extension of Authorization for Special Committee on Post-Traumatic 


Stress Disorder (sec. 202)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 502) that would modify 
section 110(e)(2) of the Veterans' Health Care Act of 1984, P.L. 98-
528, to extend the reporting requirement for the Special Committee on 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Currently, the reporting requirement is 
set to expire in 2008; this provision would extend it through 2012.

Section 209 of H.R. 6832 contained an identical provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the provision.







 Title III--Assistance for Families of Veterans

Clarification of Authority of Secretary of Veterans Affairs to Provide 


Mental Health Services to Families of Veterans (sec. 301)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 601) that would amend 
section 1701(5)(B) of title 38, United States Code, to clarify the 
authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide mental health 
services to families of veterans.

Section 3 of H.R. 6445 contained a provision that would modify 
section 1782(b) of title 38 so as to eliminate the requirement that 
family support services be initiated during the veteran's 
hospitalization and deemed essential to permit the veteran's discharge.

The Compromise Agreement follows the House bill with respect to the 
provision eliminating the need for services to be initiated during a 
veteran's hospitalization and essential to the veteran's discharge, but 
follows the Senate bill with respect to the provision to clarify the 
authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide mental health 
services to families.

Pilot Program on Provision of Readjustment and Transition Assistance to 


Veterans and Their Families in Cooperation with Vet Centers (sec. 


302)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 402) that would establish 
a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing 
additional readjustment and transition assistance to veterans and their 
families in cooperation with Readjustment Counseling Centers. The pilot 
would be similar to family assistance programs previously conducted at 
ten Army facilities around the country.

The House bill contained no similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision with an 
amendment to begin the pilot program no later than 180 days after the 
enactment of the Act.











 Title IV--Health Care Matters

Veterans Beneficiary Travel Program (sec. 401)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 101) that would direct 
the Secretary to reimburse qualifying veterans at the rate authorized 
for Government employees under section 5707(b) of title 5. The Senate 
provision would also strike a provision that allows the Secretary to 
raise or lower the deductible for reimbursements in proportion to a 
change in the mileage rate. Finally, the Senate provision would 
reinstate the amount of the deductible for the beneficiary travel 
reimbursement program to the amount in effect prior to the Secretary's 
February 1, 2008, decision on beneficiary travel.

The House bill contained no similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.

Mandatory Reimbursement of Veterans Receiving Emergency Treatment in 


Non-Department of Veterans Affairs Facilities until Transfer to 


Department Facilities (sec. 402)


The Senate bill contained a provision that would amend section 1725 
of title 38 in subsections (a)(1) and (f)(1). Subsection (a)(1) would 
be amended by replacing 'may reimburse' with 'shall reimburse.' This 
change would make reimbursement for emergency care received at non-VA 
facilities mandatory for eligible veterans, rather than at the 
discretion of the Secretary. Subsection (f)(1) would be amended to 
provide greater specificity regarding the termination of VA's 
obligation to reimburse. The Senate bill would also amend section 1728 
of title 38 so as to make that section, which relates to reimbursement 
for the emergency treatment of service-connected conditions, consistent 
with section 1725, as amended. Thus, reimbursement would also be made 
mandatory under Section 1728. The existing criteria, defining veteran 
eligibility for reimbursement for emergency care services, would be 
carried over in the revised statutory language. In addition, the Senate 
bill would further amend section 1728 so as to strike the phrase 'care 
and services' in current subsection (b) of section 1728, and replace 
that phrase with 'emergency treatment.' This proposed change is 
designed to promote consistency between sections 1725 and 1728.

H.R. 3819 contained similar provisions.

The Compromise Agreement contains these provisions.

Pilot Program of Enhanced Contract Care Authority for Health Care Needs 


of Veterans in Highly Rural Areas (sec. 403)


H.R. 1527 (sec. 2) would require the Secretary to conduct a pilot 
program which permits highly rural veterans who are enrolled in the 
system of patient enrollment established under section 1705(a) of title 
38, and who reside in Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) 1, 
15, 18, and 19, to elect to receive covered health services for which 
such veterans are eligible, through a non-Department health care 
provider.

The Senate bill contained no similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement follows the House bill, with an amendment 
that specifies that the pilot program will be carried out in 5 VISNs, 
four of which shall include at least three highly rural counties (as 
determined by the Secretary based upon the most recent census data), 
and one of which shall include one highly rural county. All VISNs 
selected must include an area within the borders of at least four 
states, and not be already participating in Project HERO. Eligibility 
for participation in the pilot program would be limited to those 
veterans already enrolled in the VA health care system at the time of 
commencement of the program, as well as OIF/OEF veterans who are 
eligible for VA health care under section 1710(e)(3)(C) of title 38.

Epilepsy Centers of Excellence (sec. 404)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 103) that would require 
that the Secretary, upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for 
Health, designate not less than six Department health care facilities 
as locations for epilepsy centers of excellence.

H.R. 2818 (sec. 2) would require the Secretary to designate an 
epilepsy center of excellence at each of the 5 centers designated under 
section 7327 of title 38 (Centers for research, education, and clinical 
activities on complex multi-trauma associated with combat injuries).

The Compromise Agreement specifies that the Secretary shall designate 
at least four but not more than six Department health care facilities 
as locations for epilepsy centers of excellence. Not less than two of 
these centers shall be collocated with centers designated under 7327 of 
title 38.

Establishment of Qualifications for Peer Specialist Appointees (sec. 


405)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 104) that would amend 
section 7402(b) of title 38 so as to define qualifications for peer 
specialist positions employed by the Veterans Health Administration. 
Specifically, in order to be eligible to be appointed to a peer 
specialist position, a person must be a veteran who has recovered or is 
recovering from a mental health condition; and be certified by a not-
for-profit entity engaged in peer specialist training by having met 
such criteria as the Secretary shall establish for a peer specialist 
position; or a State by having satisfied relevant State requirements 
for a peer specialist position. The Senate bill would also amend 
section 7402 of title 38 so as to add a new subsection providing 
authority for the Secretary to enter into contracts with not-for-profit 
entities to provide peer specialist training to veterans and 
certification for veterans.

The House bill contained no similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.

Establishment of Consolidated Patient Accounting Centers (sec. 406)


Section 5 of H.R. 6445 contained a provision that would amend chapter 
17 of title 38 to insert a new section mandating that not later than 5 
years after the date of enactment of this bill, the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs shall establish not more than seven consolidated 
patient accounting centers for conducting industry-modeled regionalized 
billing and collection activities of the Department.

The Senate bill contained no comparable provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.







Repeal of Limitation on Authority to Conduct Widespread HIV Testing 

Program (sec. 407)Section 217 of S. 2969 would repeal section 124 of 
Public Law 100-322, which permits VA to test a patient for HIV 
infection only if the veteran receives pre-test counseling and provides 
written informed consent for such testing. Eliminating this section 
from the law would bring VA's statutory HIV testing requirements in 
line with current guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.

Section 6 of H.R. 6445 contained an identical provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the provision.

Provision of Comprehensive Health Care by Secretary of Veterans Affairs 


to Children of Vietnam Veterans Born with Spina Bifida (sec. 408)


H.R. 5729 would amend section 1803(a) of title 38 so as to expand the 
existing VA Spina Bifida Health Care Program and provide a 
comprehensive health benefit to beneficiaries.

The Senate bill contained no comparable provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.

Exemption from Copayment Requirement for Veterans Receiving Hospice 


Care (sec. 409)


Section 309 of S. 1233 would amend section 1710 of title 38 so as to 
exempt hospice care provided in all settings from the copayment 
requirement for VA long-term care. Under current law, only hospice care 
provided in a VA nursing home is exempted from copayment.


H.R. 2623 contained a similar provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the provision.














 Title V--Pain Care

Comprehensive Policy on Pain Management (sec. 501)


The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 201) that would require 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and implement a 
comprehensive policy on the management of pain experienced by veterans 
enrolled for VA health care services no later than October 1, 2008.

The policy would be required to cover the following: the Department-
wide management of acute and chronic pain experienced by veterans; the 
standard of care for pain management to be used throughout the 
Department; the consistent application of pain assessments to be used 
throughout the Department; the assurance of prompt and appropriate pain 
care treatment and management by the Department, system-wide, when 
medically necessary; Department programs of research related to acute 
and chronic pain suffered by veterans, including pain attributable to 
central and peripheral nervous system damage characteristic of injuries 
incurred in modern warfare; Department programs of pain care education 
and training for health care personnel of the Department; and 
Department programs of patient education for veterans suffering from 
acute or chronic pain and their families.

Section 4 of H.R. 6445 contained identical provisions.

The Compromise Agreement contains the provisions, but would require 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and implement a 
comprehensive policy on pain management no later than October 1, 2009.










Title VI--Homeless Veterans Matters

Increase in Authorization of Appropriations for the Homeless Grant and 


Per Diem Program (sec. 601)


Section 506 of S. 2969 would amend section 2013 of title 38, to 
increase the authorization of appropriations for the Homeless Grant and 
Per Diem Program from $130 million to $200 million.

The House bill contained no comparable provision.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision but changes 
the authorization amount to $150 million.

Expansion and Extension of Authority for Program of Referral and 


Counseling Services for At-risk Veterans Transitioning from Certain 


Institutions (sec. 602)


Section 403 of S. 1233 would amend section 2023 of title 38 so as to 
extend and expand the authority for a program to aid incarcerated 
veterans in their transition back to civilian life. The program would 
be extended until September 30, 2011, and would be expanded from six to 
twelve sites.

Section 7 of H.R. 2874 contained identical provisions.

The Compromise Agreement contains the provision, but would extend the 
program until September 30, 2012.

Permanent Authority for Domiciliary Services for Homeless Veterans and 


Enhancement of Capacity of Domiciliary Care Programs for Female 


Veterans (sec. 603)


Section 405 of S. 1233 would amend section 2043 of title 38 to make 
permanent an existing authority to expand domiciliary care for homeless 
women veterans.

Section 8 of H.R. 2874 contained identical provisions.

The Compromise Agreement contains the provisions.

Financial Assistance for Supportive Services for Very-low Income 


Veteran Families in Permanent Housing (sec. 604)


Section 406 of S. 1233 would amend title 38 so as to add a new 
section 2044, relating to supportive services for very low-income 
veterans and their families occupying permanent housing. Proposed new 
section 2044 would direct VA to provide grants to eligible entities to 
provide and coordinate the provision of a comprehensive range of 
supportive services for very low-income veteran families occupying 
permanent housing, including those transitioning from homelessness to 
such housing.

Those families may be occupying permanent housing, moving into 
permanent housing within 90 days, or moving from one permanent 
residence to another to better suit their needs. Entities eligible to 
receive grants under this provision are public or private non-profit 
organizations which have demonstrated the capacity and experience 
necessary to deliver the services outlined in the proposed new section. 
Under the provisions of the proposed new section 2044, grants would be 
provided for a wide range of services, so as to give families a broad 
set of tools to maintain a permanent residence. To this end, providers 
could receive grants to furnish outreach, case management, assistance 
in obtaining and coordinating VA benefits, and assistance in obtaining 
and coordinating other public benefits provided by federal, state, or 
local agencies or organizations.

Section 9 of H.R. 2874 contained similar provisions but provided a 
more expansive list of supportive services, and authorized for 
appropriations a different funding level.

The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.

Title VII--Authorization of Medical Facility Projects and Major Medical 














Facility Leases

Authorization for Fiscal Year 2009 Major Medical Facility Projects 


(sec. 701)


Section 701 of S. 2969 would authorize:

 $54,000,000 to construct a facility to replace a seismically unsafe 
acute psychiatric inpatient building in Palo Alto, California.

 $131,800,000 for an outpatient clinic in Lee County, Florida.

 $225,900,000 to make seismic corrections at a VA Medical Center in 
San Juan, Puerto Rico.

 $66,000,000 to construct a state-of-the-art polytrauma health care 
and rehabilitation center in San Antonio, Texas.

Section 101 of H.R. 6832 contained the same provisions, except for 
Lee County, Florida. Instead, H.R. 6832 authorizes the Lee County 
project under a different section.

The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.

Modification of Authorization Amounts for Certain Major Medical 


Facility Construction Projects Previously Authorized (sec. 702)


Section 702 of S. 2969 would modify previous authorizations by 
providing $625,000,000 for restoration, new construction, or 
replacement of the medical care facility for the VA Medical Center at 
New Orleans, Louisiana.

Section 102 of H.R. 6832 contained the same provisions and the 
following additional provisions:

 $769,200,000 for the replacement of the VA Medical Center at Denver, 
Colorado.

 $131,800,000 for an outpatient clinic in Lee County, Florida.

 $136,700,000 to correct patient privacy deficiencies at the VA
