# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `f268b949d2bb44f27bae46bda04263f3`
`Mr. STARK â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 248 
to bring our troops home from Afghanistan.

Despite the wishes of the people who voted him into office, President 
Obama is escalating the War in Afghanistan. It's now up to Congress to 
end the war. This resolution would invoke the War Powers Resolution of 
1973, and


remove troops from Afghanistan no later than the end of the year.

This war has no clear objective. We have spent $258 billion on the 
War in Afghanistan, with billions more to come this year. American 
soldiers and their families are paying a greater price. Over 1,000 
soldiers have died, and over 5,000 have been wounded in action. 
According to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Human Rights 
Watch, and other humanitarian organizations, tens of thousands of 
Afghan civilians have been killed.

It is time for Congress to assert its constitutional authority over 
matters of war and bring our troops home. I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution, so that we can focus on diplomacy and 
infrastructure development that will bring a lasting peace to 
Afghanistan.
