`Mr. POE of Texas â€” 23 September 2009`

---


Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the tiny tyrant from Iran, President 
Ahmadinejad, is speaking at the United Nations today, continuing to 
spread his hate against Israel and the United States. He's taunting the 
world with his nuclear program--by intimidation. He wants a nuclear 
bomb. And recent leaked reports say he's got all the elements to build 
a nuclear weapon.

The administration has abandoned the American missile defense shield 
based in Poland that was to protect us from Iranian missiles. Just a 
few days ago, one popular Polish newspaper had the front page headline 
that said, ''Betrayed! The United States has sold us to the Russians 
and stabbed us in the back.'' We have left our allies vulnerable--like 
Poland--who stand with us fighting terrorism in Afghanistan.

The little fella in the desert has challenged the United States of 
America. He's called us out, and we backed off. We have succumbed to 
the Desert Rat's demands.

Truman, Kennedy, Reagan. None of these historical giants ever backed 
down from a gunslinger's threats. They knew that it was their 
responsibility to protect this Nation. To stand with our allies. When 
they were called out by tyrants, they stood their ground and did not 
flinch.

Has America lost its nerve? We shall see.

And that's just the way it is.
