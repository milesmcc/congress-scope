Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the nomination of General George 
Casey to be Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army and disavow attempts to 
blame him for the failures in Iraq.

The blame for the disastrous and reckless war in Iraq lies with the 
President, Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of Defense 
Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The blame 
starts at the top. It is they who must be held accountable.

General Casey did not author the misguided doctrine of preemptive 
war. General Casey did not manipulate and politicize intelligence to 
sell the Iraq war to the American people. And General Casey did not 
fail to provide a political solution to end the sectarian violence that 
is now engulfing Iraq. It is the civilian leadership of the Bush 
administration that continues to fail us in Iraq.

When I traveled to Iraq and met with General Casey, he told me the 
truth. He said that the U.S. presence was fueling the insurgency. I 
appreciated his candor. He fully understood the dangers and challenges 
in Iraq. Unlike so many in the Bush administration, his view of the 
situation in Iraq was not distorted by rose-colored classes.

General Casey did not lead us down this dangerous path in Iraq. 
Therefore I cast a ''yes'' vote.
