`Ms. SLAUGHTER â€” 8 October 2009`

---


Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, the rule provides for consideration of the conference 
report to accompany H.R. 2647, the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2010. The rule waives all points of order against the 
conference report and against its consideration. The rule provides that 
the previous question shall be considered as ordered without any 
intervening motion except 1 hour of debate and, if applicable, one 
motion to recommit.

The bill was introduced on June 2, 2009, by Chairman Ike Skelton and 
referred to the Committee on Armed Services. The committee marked up 
the bill on June 16, 2009, and ordered it favorably reported, as 
amended, by voice vote June 16, 2009.

The Committee on Rules reported a structured rule making in order 69 
amendments, which then passed the floor 222-202. And today we have the 
conference report that we have now concurred with the Senate.

Despite any differences about our ongoing missions in Afghanistan or 
Iraq, we all agree that funds that have already been approved as part 
of the annual spending plans should not be held up for any reason, not 
with our troops in harm's way.

The bill authorizes $550.2 billion in budget authority for the 
Department of Defense and the national security programs of the 
Department of Energy and also authorizes $130 billion for overseas 
contingency operations for fiscal year 2010.

For our service men and women, it authorizes a pay raise of 3.4 
percent for the military, expands TRICARE health coverage for Reserve 
members, bars fee increases on TRICARE inpatient care


for 1 year, and provides $2.2 billion for housing programs to improve 
the quality of life for our servicepersons' families.

On Afghanistan, the bill responds to concerns raised by Members of 
both parties and requires an assessment of progress in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan toward security and stability. It also bans permanent bases in 
Afghanistan and provides funds to train and equip the Afghan National 
Security Forces, the ANSF.

There is also language in the bill that requires a reporting system 
to register and track all the U.S. defense items that are provided to 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, to help combat waste and fraud. This is 
especially important in light of recent news stories showing that 
millions of dollars destined for Pakistan to battle militants in al 
Qaeda have been diverted to either the domestic economy or ''for other 
purposes.'' In fact, between 2002 and 2008, while al Qaeda regrouped, 
only $500 million of the $6.6 billion in American aid actually made it 
to the Pakistani military, according to two Army generals quoted in an 
Associated Press story from earlier this week. I will insert that story 
into the Record.







Billions in U.S. Aid Never Reached Pakistan Army














 (By Kathy Gannon)




 Islamabad, Pakistan.--The United States has long suspected 


 that much of the billions of dollars it has sent Pakistan to 


 battle militants has been diverted to the domestic economy 


 and other causes, such as fighting India.



 Now the scope and longevity of the misuse is becoming 


 clear: Between 2002 and 2008, while al-Qaida regrouped, only 


 $500 million of the $6.6 billion in American aid actually 


 made it to the Pakistani military, two army generals tell The 


 Associated Press.



 The account of the generals, who asked to remain anonymous 


 because military rules forbid them from speaking publicly, 


 was backed up by other retired and active generals, former 


 bureaucrats and government ministers.



 At the time of the siphoning, Pervez Musharraf, a 


 Washington ally, served as both chief of staff and president, 


 making it easier to divert money intended for the military to 


 bolster his sagging image at home through economic subsidies.



 ''The army itself got very little,'' said retired Gen. 


 Mahmud Durrani, who was Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S. 


 under Musharraf. ''It went to things like subsidies, which is 


 why everything looked hunky-dory. The military was financing 


 the war on terror out of its own budget.''



 Generals and ministers say the diversion of the money hurt 


 the military in very real ways:



 Helicopters critical to the battle in rugged border regions 


 were not available. At one point in 2007, more than 200 


 soldiers were trapped by insurgents in the tribal regions 


 without a helicopter lift to rescue them.



 The limited night vision equipment given to the army was 


 taken away every three months for inventory and returned 


 three weeks later.



 Equipment was broken, and training was lacking. It was not 


 until 2007 that money was given to the Frontier Corps, the 


 front-line force, for training.



 The details on misuse of American aid come as Washington 


 again promises Pakistan money. Legislation to triple general 


 aid to Pakistan cleared Congress last week. The legislation 


 also authorizes ''such sums as are necessary'' for military 


 assistance to Pakistan, upon several conditions. The 


 conditions include certification that Pakistan is cooperating 


 in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, that 


 Pakistan is making a sustained commitment to combating 


 terrorist groups and that Pakistan security forces are not 


 subverting the country's political or judicial processes.



 The U.S. is also insisting on more accountability for 


 reimbursing money spent. For example, Pakistan is still 


 waiting for $1.7 billion for which it has billed the United 


 States under a Coalition Support Fund to reimburse allies for 


 money spent on the war on terror.



 But the U.S. still can't follow what happens to the money 


 it doles out.



 ''We don't have a mechanism for tracking the money after we 


 have given it to them,'' Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mark 


 Wright said in a telephone interview.



 Musharraf's spokesman, retired Gen. Rashid Quereshi, flatly 


 denied that his former boss had shortchanged the army. He did 


 not address the specific charges. ''He has answered these 


 questions. He has answered all the questions,'' the spokesman 


 said. Musharraf took power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and 


 resigned in August 2008.



 The misuse of funding helps to explain how al-Qaida, 


 dismantled in Afghanistan in 2001, was able to regroup, grow 


 and take on the weak Pakistani army. Even today, the army 


 complains of inadequate equipment to battle Taliban 


 entrenched in tribal regions.



 For its part, Washington did not ask many questions of a 


 leader, Musharraf, whom it considered an ally, according to a 


 U.S. Government Accountability Office report released last 


 year.



 Pakistan has received more money from the fund than any 


 other nation. It is also the least expensive war front. The 


 amount the U.S. spends per soldier per month is just $928, 


 compared with $76,870 in Afghanistan and $85,640 in Iraq.



 Yet by 2008, the United States had provided Pakistan with 


 $8.6 billion in military money, and more than $12 billion in 


 all.



 ''The army was sending in the bills,'' said one general who 


 asked not to be identified because it is against military 


 rules to speak publicly. ''The army was taking from its 


 coffers to pay for the war effort--the access roads 


 construction, the fuel, everything. . . . This is the 


 reality--the army got peanuts.''



 Some of the money from the U.S. even went to buying weapons 


 from the United States better suited to fighting India than 


 in the border regions of Afghanistan--armor-piercing tow 


 missiles, sophisticated surveillance equipment, air-to-air 


 missiles, maritime patrol aircraft, anti-ship missiles and F-


 16 fighter aircraft.



 ''Pakistan insisted and America agreed. Pakistan said we 


 also have a threat from other sources,'' Durrani said, 


 referring to India, ''and we have to strengthen our overall 


 capacity. ''The money was used to buy and support capability 


 against India.''



 The army also suffered from mismanagement, Durrani said. As 


 an example, he cited Pakistani attempts to buy badly needed 


 attack helicopters.



 Pakistan asked for Cobra helicopters because it knows how 


 to maintain them, he said. But the helicopters were old, and 


 to make them battle-ready, the Pentagon sent them to a 


 company that had no experience with Cobras and took two 


 years, he said.



 As a result, in 2007, Pakistan had only one working 


 helicopter--a debilitating handicap in the battle against 


 insurgents who hide, train and attack from the hulking 


 mountains that run like a seam along the Afghan-Pakistani 


 border.



 The army was also frustrated about not getting more money. 


 Military spokesman Gen. Athar Abbas said the U.S. gave 


 nothing to offset the cost of Pakistan's dead and wounded in 


 the war on terror. He estimated 1,800 Pakistani soldiers had 


 been killed since 2003 and 4,800 more wounded, most of them 


 seriously.



 The hospital and rehabilitation costs for the wounded have 


 come to more than $25 million, Abbas said. Pakistan's 


 military also gives land to the widows of the dead, educates 


 their children and provides health care.



 ''These costs do not appear anywhere,'' he said. ''There is 


 no U.S. compensation for the casualties, assistance with aid 


 to the grieving families.''



 Even while money was being siphoned off for other purposes 


 on Pakistan's end, the U.S. imposed little control over or 


 even had specific knowledge of what went where, according to 


 reports by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The 


 reports covered 2002 through 2008.



 The reports found that the Pentagon often ignored its own 


 oversight rules, didn't get adequate documents and doled out 


 money without asking for an explanation.



 For more than a year, the Pentagon paid Pakistan's navy 


 $19,000 a month per vehicle just for repair costs on a fleet 


 of fewer than 20 vehicles. Monthly food bills doubled for no 


 apparent reason, and for a year the Pentagon paid the bills 


 without checking, according to the report.



 Daniyal Aziz, a minister in Musharraf's government, said he 


 warned U.S. officials that the money they were giving his 


 government was being misused, but to no avail.



 ''They both deserved each other, Musharraf and the 


 Americans,'' he said.


Within this bill is authorization for 30 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 
aircraft and the continued development and procurement of the F136 
Joint Strike Fighter competitive engine but does not authorize the 
advance procurement of F-22 aircraft.

It authorizes $6.7 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, MRAP, 
vehicles and fully funds the new MRAP all-terrain variant requirement 
for Afghanistan. We've seen far too many reports of our troops dying 
because their vehicles are ripped apart by roadside bombs. We can and 
will do better to protect them from these risks.

Under the provisions of this bill, the military will increase by 
30,000 Army troops, 8,100 marines, 14,650 Air Force personnel, and 
2,477 Navy sailors in 2010. It also authorizes an additional 30,000 
Army troops in fiscal years 2011 and 2012.

The bill provides support for the plan to increase the size of our 
civilian workforce so that we can reduce DOD's reliance on contractors 
for core acquisition functions. This is also a most important point to 
cut down on fraud and waste. The bill also provides DOD with the needed 
flexibility to reform the DOD hiring process to reduce the fraud and 
abuse through enhanced contractor oversight, which is long overdue.

The bill speaks to vessels carrying DOD cargo in high piracy risk 
areas by requiring that they be equipped with appropriate nonlethal 
defense measures. And it strengthens the DOD's


ability to face threats and vulnerabilities by improving research and 
promoting military and civilian cyber workforce development.

It improves accountability and oversight in awarding defense 
contracts by providing the Defense Department the authority to require 
return of award and incentive fees. The bill prohibits a company from 
being awarded future contracts if its action leads to a servicemember's 
death or severe injury. This, of course, is in response to the number 
of soldiers who were electrocuted by bad plumbing work.

To address concerns about the treatment of detainees, the bill bans 
interrogation of detainees by contractors and requires the Department 
of Defense to give the International Committee of the Red Cross prompt 
access to detainees held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in 
Afghanistan.

In addition, the bill reforms the Military Commissions Act to clarify 
rules and improve trial procedures to make military commissions fair 
and effective, and puts new revisions into place that would forbid the 
use of statements alleged to have been secured through cruel, inhuman, 
or degrading treatment.

Finally, the bill provides the accused with the enhanced ability to 
select his own counsel and to make hearsay evidence harder to use in 
court. It improves procedures for the handling of classified 
information while also permitting military commissions to continue 
existing cases for 90 days or until revisions have been made to 
supporting court manuals and handbooks.

The bill matches the administration's request for $9.3 billion for 
missile defense programs and provides the resources necessary to meet 
threats facing the United States, our deployed forces, and our friends 
and allies, and provides $2.2 billion to support the Department of 
Energy's nonproliferation programs. It strengthens the Stockpile 
Stewardship Program to ensure that the nuclear weapons stockpile is 
safe, secure, and reliable without the use of underground testing.

Further, the bill provides technical and financial support to local 
law enforcement and prosecutors that they can more aggressively try 
violent crimes which are motivated by the victim's race, color, 
religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
or disability; expands the ability of Federal prosecutors to try 
similar types of cases in Federal court if State or local officials are 
unable or unwilling to prosecute these cases; and criminalizes attacks 
against U.S. servicemembers because of their service to their country.

I want to address one last point. The bill includes new hate crimes 
legislation that will prohibit offenses based on the actual or 
perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, or disability of any person. This kind of 
far-reaching protection is important for America, and I am proud to 
support it.

There are still far too many incidences of violence in and around our 
schools and churches. During the last 10 years, 69 persons have been 
killed or injured at church and another 122 children have died in or 
around their school. The numbers are devastating. One has only to look 
at the beating death of Chicago teenager Derrion Albert outside his 
high school, an honor student, to see how devastating it is to see 
violence in our schools. I hope this bill can help bring an end to that 
sorrow.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
