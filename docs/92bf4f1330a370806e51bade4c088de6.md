Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I rise in support of this resolution.

It's very important that we take a good look at where we are in the 
country of Iraq. It's important that we take a good look at the status 
of the United States military forces, in particular our Army, which is 
being stretched and strained nearly beyond recognition.

You can't help but have a great deal of pride in the young men and 
young women in doing the duty upon which they have been called. But it 
is important for us to turn the reins, give the baton over to the Iraqi 
forces, to the Iraqi Government. We cannot hold their hand there 
forever. It is important that we redeploy our forces in a responsible 
and reasonable manner so that their readiness is assured in case of 
some future challenge.
