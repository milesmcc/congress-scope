`Mrs. BLACKBURN â€” 23 January 2007`

Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman.

And one of the things that we have our focus on as we prepare for the 
State of the Union tonight and for the work that is before us for the 
rest of this Congress is certainly making certain that we are 
successful in our efforts in Iraq and making certain that we are 
successful in the war on terror.

Mr. Speaker, our constituents know that this has been a long war. 
They know that the terrorists started attacking us over two decades 
ago, and they also know that on September 11 this Nation decided we 
were no longer going to respond to terrorist attacks as civil 
disobedience. What we were going to do was to change course, and we 
were going to respond to it as what it is: an act of war. And our 
constituents all know, especially constituents in my district, National 
Guard families, Reserve families, families at Fort Campbell that are in 
our district, they know that this is a very, very difficult time for 
our Nation, and it is a difficult time for our men and women in 
uniform. And they know that freedom is worth protecting.

And when I talk to those men and women, many who have been deployed 
in Afghanistan, have done two deployments in Iraq and know that they 
may be going back, they will say, Yes, we are going back because our 
job is not done. And they understand it, Mr. Speaker. And they know 
that we take a step forward and then we take a step or two back, and 
that it comes very slowly, and that progress is very slow.

We have seen, and our colleague John Shadegg had handed me an article 
from Real Clear Politics that pointed out some things that have been 
happening recently that just haven't caught the eye of the media, and I 
wish that they had because I would like for them to catch the eye of 
the American people.

First of all, there appears to be some retreating by al Qaeda from 
Baghdad because they know that troop levels are returning to where they 
were during the electoral process that took place in January of last 
year in Iraq. They know that the radical cleric, al Sadr, has decided 
to call off his boycott, and that his people are returning to 
participate in that newly formed Parliament, and they know that he is 
lowering his profile. And they also have seen Prime Minister al Maliki 
begin to take a change of course and to put some distance between 
himself and al Sadr. But this is of tremendous concern to us when we 
hear the naysayers talk about cutting funding and not supporting the 
troops.

And this morning I was on the floor speaking about our colleague Sam 
Johnson, who truly is a hero and has a wonderful piece of legislation 
that steps forward. It is House Resolution 511, and it really pushes 
forward on the idea of supporting our troops and funding these men and 
women who are in harm's way, making certain that they have what they 
need to do the job that is in front of them; sending the message to 
them that we stand with them and we are not going to desert them.

We know that this is difficult work. We know that it is a job, as I 
said, that is slow; that progress is slow. But, Mr. Speaker, as we 
stand here today preparing for the State of the Union, and as we expect 
to hear this evening from our Commander in Chief that the state of the 
Union is indeed strong, we also want these men and women in uniform to 
know that it is strong because of the work they do.

We have the ability to stand here every day and talk about freedom 
and defend freedom and talk about having a Nation that is so wonderful 
and so diverse that we all, each and every one of us, can pursue our 
dreams, can focus on hope and opportunity that is so important to us. 
We do that because men and women have put their life on the line, many 
times more than once, many times for days on end, to be certain that 
freedom remains. And we feel that it is appropriate to bring forward a 
resolution that says fund the troops and fund their needs.

We think that it is important that we move forward letting the men 
and women know that, when they are in the field, we are listening to 
them. We are listening to the troops. We are listening to the 
commanders, and we respect their judgment. That is an important message 
for us to send.

And I yield to the gentleman from Georgia for his comments.
