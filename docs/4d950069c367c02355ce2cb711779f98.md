Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, today 
on this Defense authorization bill, while we are debating the war in 
Iraq and good treatment for our soldiers, the Republican leader comes 
to the floor and insists they cannot bring up for a vote the amendment 
that is pending by Senator Webb of Virginia even though you offered a 
Republican amendment to be voted on at the same time. The Republican 
leader has said: No, we want to delay this. We want to delay this until 
tomorrow and then perhaps another 2 days beyond and to filibuster it 
during that period of time.

It would seem there is a pattern emerging, a very clear pattern where 
it comes to the important business. Whether it is ethics reform or 
changing the policy in Iraq, the Republican position is to stop the 
process, slow down the process, throw in every obstacle they can find.

I ask the majority leader if this pattern has been evidenced in terms 
of, for example, filibusters, delaying tactics on the part of the 
Republicans?
