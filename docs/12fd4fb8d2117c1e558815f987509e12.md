`Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts â€” 15 April 2010`

---


Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, in conclusion, I concur 
with all the comments made by the Senators before me. One of the things 
I found most interesting--and I have a hearing in about an hour on the 
Afghan police and the contracting associated with our supporting the 
police force in Afghanistan--is that I was able to ask very direct 
questions to our Ambassadors and to the military and civilian leaders 
who helped me better understand where the $6 billion we have spent to 
uplift the Afghan police force has gone.

Another reason I went there was self-serving in that it gave me the 
tools to make sure I can better inquire to find out on behalf of the 
American people where their money is going, how it is


being spent, and whether we can find a way to spend it better.

In addition to that, one of the things that was glaring to me is that 
even in Pakistan there is an illiteracy problem that needs to be 
addressed. I think that illiteracy problem, if not addressed, will be 
fertile ground for the Taliban to come in and try to influence the 
youth of that country. They have a lot of hope, yet they have some very 
serious problems.

Once again, I thank our leader. I have great respect for him, someone 
I didn't know before we went. I encourage others to do that and have 
that bipartisan feel, as I tried to do often. We saw Senator Baucus 
over there with his team kind of shadowing us, making sure we were 
actually working. It was a lot of fun to see them over there as well, 
even with their travel problems. But I am looking forward to doing it 
again.

I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to speak.
