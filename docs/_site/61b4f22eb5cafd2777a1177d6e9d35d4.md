Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, indeed it is an anniversary. It's about 
the 80th-day anniversary since the President asked for funding for our 
troops. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
theatrics the Democratic majority is trying to pass off as some kind of 
policy.

Today, Speaker Pelosi will stage an elaborate and politically timed 
signing ceremony for the Iraq troop withdrawal bill Congress passed 5 
days ago. As President Bush has already vowed to veto this 
irresponsible legislation, Speaker Pelosi's theatrics are simply 
slowing down the process of getting much needed funding and money to 
our troops.

Let me remind the American people that our warfighters have been 
waiting nearly 3 months for Congress to pass the President's requested 
supplemental funding for the war. The Democratic leader might think a 
few days here don't mean much, don't matter much. Every day they stall 
to appease left-wing activists is another day our military must wait 
for the funding it needs to win this war.

Madam Speaker, I admonish Speaker Pelosi to quit playing politics 
with our


national security. Let Congress vote on a clean funding bill for our 
troops. The Democratic leaders may be content to lose the war, but the 
troops are in harm's way, and they certainly will not lose this war.
