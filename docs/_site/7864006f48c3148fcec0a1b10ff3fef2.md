Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the resolution offered by Representative Baca of California. 
I applaud him for bringing this resolution to the floor today and I am 
very proud to support his efforts.

With a district with so many veterans, I can honestly stand here 
today and tell you that Veterans Day in my district is on par with the 
love of God, mom and apple pie. Almost every town and municipality in 
the eight counties that make up my congressional district goes out of 
their way to hold a public event celebrating the accomplishments of our 
Nation's veterans.

Traveling around my district, I have met literally thousands of men 
and some women who recount their stories of military service with pride 
and with joy. They tell of the bravery of their comrades, of the 
sacrifices to protect the innocent and the weak and the memories of 
those killed in action.

The resolution before us, House Resolution 237, is a good sense of 
the House that encourages the celebration of Veterans Day. Veterans Day 
is not just another day to go to the mall or look for Veterans Day 
sales but, rather, to honor those who have served our country.

These brave soldiers fought for our freedoms and the liberties of our 
Nation around the world, including France, England, Poland, Vietnam, 
Korea, Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. The actions of the American 
military throughout the history of our Nation have helped advance the 
cause of freedom around the globe and protect citizens from attack from 
foreign powers, and today from attacks from terrorists.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage every American to adopt the spirit of this 
resolution in celebrating Veterans Day and show our veterans how much 
we appreciate their sacrifice and the time served. May God bless our 
soldiers and our veterans.
