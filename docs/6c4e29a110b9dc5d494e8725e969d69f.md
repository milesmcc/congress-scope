Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of our troops 
and H.R. 511, legislation reaffirming Congress's support for the troops 
deployed in a theater of war. Those overseas protecting us from further 
terrorist attacks and fighting nobly on the Global War on Terror 
deserve our steadfast support.

The President has recognized missteps and offered a new direction and 
plan for victory. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have yet 
to address the issue, except to criticize the President's plan before 
it has even been implemented. It was Leader Boehner and the Republican 
Conference that have called upon the Speaker to create a select 
committee on oversight to hold the President and Prime Minister Maliki 
accountable for progress in Iraq.

Madam Speaker, I stand here with pride and offer my full support to 
the brave soldiers who are helping foster democracy in the Middle East, 
while, at the same time preventing terrorists from attacking us on our 
soil. So many Members pledged ''We will never forget.'' Well, that is a 
promise I made and intend to fulfill.

To our troops, thank you for your dedication, bravery and noble work 
to make the world and America a better place, following in the 
footsteps of so many American heroes.

I commend Congressman Sam Johnson, an American hero, and urge support 
of H.R. 511.
