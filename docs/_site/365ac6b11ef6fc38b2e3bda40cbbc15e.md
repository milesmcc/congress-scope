Mr. JONES. Congressman, thank you very much for yielding. I will be 
brief.

I think what's been said by Mr. McGovern, you, as well as Congressman 
Paul, is that Congress needs to meet its responsibility to debate these 
issues. That's why I want to read from the former commandant of the 
Marine Corps who e-mailed me this information. I just want to read one 
brief paragraph.

''With all due respect to the 'COIN experts,' to execute the clear, 
hold and build strategy being put forth will require far more than the 
40,000 to 80,000 more troops being discussed. No one who knows anything 
about counterinsurgency would argue that fact. I can


promise you, our troops are so overextended right now that they 
couldn't produce the numbers needed . . . and the equipment would not 
be available.''

One other point. I am certainly skipping around but trying to pick 
out something that would be of interest to this debate. ''Finally, 
Afghanistan is not Iraq . . . or Vietnam . . . or Iran. It is totally 
different!

''This is a country (notice I don't dignify it with the term 
'nation') that is totally tribal in nature. It has no real government. 
You cannot even imagine it as a nation-state that can be dealt with and 
considered an ally.''

This, again, is why we are frustrated, the four of us tonight on the 
floor. We have seen the pain, the hurt. You've talked about it; Jim's 
talked about it; Ron's talked about it; I've talked about it. This 
country owes it to the families of our military to debate this on the 
floor of the House with 435 here on the floor of the House to be part 
of the debate or we're not meeting our responsibility to the men and 
women in uniform.

I yield back.
