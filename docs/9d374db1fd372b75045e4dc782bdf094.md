`Mr. ENGEL â€” 17 October 2007`

Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, Captain Joan R. Davis was awarded the Army 
Commendation Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Army Achievement 
Medal, among other awards, for her accomplishments as Head Nurse in 
Camp Bucca, Iraq.

There she was responsible for the comprehensive health care needs and 
provision of health care to more than 8,600 detainees. To accomplish 
this she was responsible for the oversight of 10 officers and 75 
enlisted personnel.

Among her many duties was the assessment, planning, and 
implementation and evaluation of detainees at the facility. She 
provided consultations with other members of the allied health care 
team on the highly complex comprehensive nursing care of the diabetic 
population.

She also served as liaison with forward Operating Base and Theater 
Internment Facilities.

We are fortunate to have such an individual with us here in the 
Bronx, as a Registered Nurse at Montefiore Medical Center. I 
congratulate her for her dedicated service to our country and for her 
equally dedicated service at MMC.
