Mr. DURBIN. I don't serve on the Armed Services Committee, but it is 
my guess that redeploying troops is also a very expensive endeavor--
maybe as expensive as deploying them and holding a position. So I don't 
know if there will be a savings if there is a redeployment. Although I 
voted against the use of force resolution that led to the invasion, I 
voted for every penny this administration asked for for the troops. I 
believe--and I think my fellow colleagues on the Democratic side, and I 
am sure on the Republican side--that they don't want to shortchange the 
troops either as they stay in Iraq or if they are redeployed from Iraq. 
I would judge the supplemental under those circumstances. What will it 
cost to redeploy them safely?
