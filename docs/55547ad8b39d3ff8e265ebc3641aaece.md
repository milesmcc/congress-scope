Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am very supportive of 
our troops around the globe and in particular those who are in harm's 
way in Iraq. I wholeheartedly support H. Con. Res. 63.

Mr. Speaker, in the President's January 29, 2002, State of the Union 
address, in regards to protecting America, responding to terrorist 
threats and capturing Osama bin Laden, he said, this is a regime that 
agreed to international inspections, then kicked out our inspectors. 
This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.

States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of 
evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of 
mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They 
could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match 
their hatred.

Secretary Rice, after being named Secretary to succeed Colin Powell, 
warned 6 months before the invasion in Iraq that Saddam Hussein could 
deploy a nuclear weapon, saying that the administration did not want a 
smoking gun. We want to know as New Yorkers, when will we find Osama 
bin Laden
