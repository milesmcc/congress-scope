# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mr. NADLER â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this resolution and to 
call upon my colleagues to make a commitment to protect our troops and 
to bring them home as quickly and safely as possible.

Mr. Speaker, the American people and Members of Congress were 
deceived. Every reason we were given for invading Iraq was false. 
Weapons of mass destruction, not there. Saddam Hussein working hand in 
glove with al Qaeda, not true.

I ask you, if the President had gone to the American people and said, 
we must invade a country that poses no imminent threat to us and 
sacrifice thousands of lives in order to create a


democratic government in Iraq, would we have assented? I think not.

As the President now says to us that we should continue indefinitely 
to expend American blood and treasure to support one side in a 
sectarian civil war, should Congress continue to consent? I think not. 
We need to say enough already. Enough with the lies and the deceit and 
the evasions, enough with the useless bloodshed.

We must protect our troops and ensure their safety while they are in 
Iraq. But we must not send more troops there to intervene in a civil 
war whose outcome they cannot determine.

And we should set a swift timetable to withdraw our troops from Iraq 
and let the contending Iraqi factions know that we will not continue to 
expend American blood and treasure to referee their civil war.

Only if faced with the reality of imminent withdrawal of American 
troops might the Iraqis strike a deal with each other and end the civil 
war. We know, Mr. Speaker, that the administration has botched the 
handling of this war. They stood by as Baghdad was looted, they failed 
to guard ammunition depots, they disbanded the Iraqi Army, they 
crippled the government by firing all of the competent civil servants 
in the name of debaathification, and they wasted countless billions of 
dollars on private contractors and on God only knows what with no 
accounting.

And all this while they continued to deny resources to the real war 
on the real terrorists. They let Osama bin Laden escape.



They allowed the Taliban to recover and to reconquer. They allow our 
ports to remain unprotected from uninspected shipping containers, and 
they let loose nuclear materials remain unaccounted for, waiting to be 
smuggled to al Qaeda to be made into nuclear weapons.

And why does the President want more troops in Iraq? To expand our 
role from fighting Sunni insurgents to fighting the Shiite militias 
also. Of course, when we attack the Shiite militias, they will respond 
by shifting their targets from Sunnis to American troops. American 
casualties will skyrocket, and we will be fighting two insurgencies 
instead of one.

I believe the President has no real plan other than not to ''lose 
Iraq'' on his watch, and to hand over the whole mess to a successor in 
2 years. He will ignore anything we do that doesn't have the force of 
law. That is why this resolution must be only the first step.

In the supplemental budget we will consider next month, we should 
exercise the only real power we have, the Congressional power of the 
purse. We will not cut off the funds and leave our troops defenseless 
before the enemy, as the demagogues would imply. But we should limit 
the use of the funds we provide to protecting the troops while they are 
in Iraq and to withdrawing them on a timetable mandated in the law. We 
should provide funds to rebuild the Army and to raise our readiness 
levels. We should provide funds for diplomatic conferences in case 
there is any possibility of negotiating an end to the Iraqi civil war. 
And we should provide funds for economic reconstruction assistance. But 
above all, we must use the power of the purse to mandate a timetable to 
withdraw the troops from Iraq.

We must use the power the people have entrusted to us. The best way 
to protect our troops is to withdraw them from the middle of a civil 
war they cannot win and that is not our fight.

I know that if we withdraw the troops, the civil war may continue and 
could get worse. But this is probably inevitable no matter how long our 
troops remain. And if the Iraqis must fight a civil war, I would rather 
they fight it without 20,000 more Americans dying.

Yes, the blindness of the administration is largely to blame for 
starting a civil war in Iraq, but we cannot end it. Only the Iraqis can 
settle their civil war. We can only make it worse and waste our blood 
and treasure pointlessly.

So let us pass this resolution, and then let us lead this country out 
of the morass in Iraq so that we can devote our resources to protecting 
ourselves from the terrorists and to improving the lives of our people.
