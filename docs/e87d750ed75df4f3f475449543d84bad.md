Mr. FILNER. I thank the chairman not only for his kind words, but for 
bringing this resolution to us on National Maritime Day, and for his 
making the connection between what we are doing today and the 
historical record that we as a Nation, I think, have to recognize and 
correct.

This resolution, H. Res. 413, does recognize the heroic and brave 
service of the Merchant Marine veterans who have gone unheralded by 
this country for far too long. Of course, this is the best time to do 
this, on National Maritime Day, which was first celebrated in


1933. It is intended to recognize the invaluable role that the maritime 
industry in general and the Merchant Marine in particular served to our 
Nation's economy and to our security.

Throughout our Nation's history, the Merchant Marine has played a 
crucial part in ensuring our freedom and security during war and in 
transporting our commerce during peace.

This day was conceptualized by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a former 
Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who firmly believed, as we continue 
to, that the Nation needed a strong Merchant Marine to serve as an 
auxiliary to our naval and other military forces during war. In fact, 
the Merchant Marine has participated in every war since serving as the 
Nation's first Navy, helping George Washington's Continental Army 
defeat the British.

After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, 29 Merchant Marine 
Academy cadets operated a fleet of boats in New York Harbor, 
transporting the firefighters and other emergency equipment workers and 
medical supplies.

It is interesting to note that the United States Merchant Marine 
Academy is the only one of our five military academies that will send 
its cadets into war; and, in fact, we have lost 142 of those cadets 
since World War II.

Today, more than 8,000 merchant mariners serve in the Military 
Sealift Command, most working in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and 
Operation Enduring Freedom.

I thank my colleague for bringing up the situation of our World War 
II veterans. As he said, it is too late to give them education 
benefits. But I have a bill, H.R. 23, that says we want to give you a 
belated thank you with a payment for the last years of their life, most 
of whom are over 80 right now.

During World War II, these merchant mariners traversed the dangerous 
U-boat-laden waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific, faced down fierce 
air attacks from kamikaze planes, and were instrumental in every 
theater of war by carrying 95 percent of all tank supplies and troops 
during the Great War. As a result, they suffered, as was pointed out, 
the highest casualty rate of any of the military branches.

It is indisputable that the allied forces would not have been able to 
begin, sustain, or finish World War II without their valiant and 
selfless service.

When I first heard of the plight of the merchant mariners of World 
War II, I could not believe the treatment that they have received. They 
did not receive any recognition as veterans that they deserved, or the 
benefits of the GI bill which they had earned. And their fight for 
equality continued for over 40 years, when they finally attained 
veteran status after a lengthy court battle. By then, over 125,000 of 
them had died.

I actually had the privilege of receiving the heart-wrenching 
testimony during a hearing before the Veterans' Affairs Committee from 
one of the named parties in that suit, in the 1980s, a merchant mariner 
named Stanley Willner. He was captured, interned, beaten, starved, and 
tortured as a POW for 3 years. He actually was one of the unfortunate 
group of Allied Forces who was forced to build the infamous bridge on 
the River Kwai.

Upon release, he weighed a mere 74 pounds. When he returned home, 
even his wife couldn't recognize him. Well, neither did his country. 
The brave merchant mariner received just 2 weeks of medical care and 
little else for his incredible service and sacrifice. What a travesty 
of justice.

Mr. Speaker, there are many more stories like this that tell about 
the merchant mariners of World War II, of opportunities lost and dreams 
foreclosed. It is long overdue that we treat these veterans the same as 
we try to do with all other veterans: Do our best to make them whole 
again.

As such, in recognition of the 74th anniversary of National Maritime 
Day, I invite all of the country and my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the brave men and women of the sea who, like the Merchant 
Marine veterans of World War II, serve selflessly to ensure our 
Nation's continued safety and prosperity by voting in favor of this 
resolution, and then taking action, hopefully in a few weeks, where we 
give a belated ''thank you'' to the merchant mariners of World War II 
and pass H.R. 23.
