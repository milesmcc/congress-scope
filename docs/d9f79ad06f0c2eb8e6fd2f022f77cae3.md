Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the President's proposal that he 
will announce tonight to increase rather than decrease the number of 
troops in Iraq defies the reality on the ground and the advice of our 
wisest military commanders. This decision will only serve to put more 
forces in the crossfire of a growing civil war. If there ever was a 
justifiable mission to depose a ruthless dictator, that mission has 
been accomplished. The Congress never authorized this military 
occupation. It is irresponsible and, in fact, immoral to allow more 
innocent American lives to be lost in vain.

Iraq is an artificial nation that was created by Winston Churchill 
and Gertrude Bell in 1922 to promote their concept of British 
imperialism. The reality is that this was never a winnable war for the 
United States of America nor in my view is it a sustainable civil 
society, and adding more troops is not going to change that reality.
