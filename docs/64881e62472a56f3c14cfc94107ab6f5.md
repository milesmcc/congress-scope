Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, it's really no secret that the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have created a massive deficit that, if 
left to Republicans, will burden our children and grandchildren with 
the debt that Republicans created. The wars have cost over $1 trillion. 
And it's mind-boggling to hear that the minority leader wants senior 
citizens to pay for these wars. He wants to increase the Social 
Security retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years 
until retirement, and wants actually to tie the cost of retirement to 
the Consumer Price Index--what an idea, boy, I tell you--instead of the 
wage inflation index. And he wants it only for those who need them.

Several years ago, the Republicans, let me remind you, they wanted to 
privatize Social Security. Democrats said, ''no.'' Can you imagine what 
would have happened to seniors had their retirements been given to Wall 
Street given Wall Street's greed and given their irresponsibility? 
Their lives would be shattered.

So Democrats will say ''no'' to Republican ideas to slash Social 
Security to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
