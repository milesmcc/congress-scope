Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I can understand what the gentleman is 
saying about sources and methods, and we understand that under some 
circumstances talking about it in public session might be harmful. But 
we asked the representative from the State Department questions, such 
as whether the Government of Iraq currently has the political will or 
the capability to root out corruption within its government. We were 
told he couldn't answer that in a public session. That is the problem 
that we are complaining about in this resolution.
