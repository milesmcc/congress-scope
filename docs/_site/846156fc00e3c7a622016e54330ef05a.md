Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 286, and it is my 
honor to stand here today and recognize the Army for its 235th 
birthday.

Since 1775, the United States Army has stood prepared to fight and 
win our Nation's wars and has provided us with some of the greatest 
moments in our history.

You know, as a poor child growing up in south Texas, I never knew 
what existed outside my neighborhood. However, when I joined the Army 
and left south Texas, the world soon opened to me. When I arrived in 
Paris, France, as a military policeman fresh out of basic training and 
advanced military training, I knew that my life had changed forever.

Shortly after arriving in Paris, a friend of mine from West Virginia, 
who had just finished basic and military police school training, we 
headed down to see the Eiffel Tower. While walking around the city, a 
limousine pulled over to our side of the road and a young woman stepped 
out of the biggest car I had ever seen in my life and approached my 
friend and me. She wanted to take a picture with us, two young soldiers 
fresh out of basic training. But it was not until about 6 months later 
that we discovered that this woman was one of the most popular movie 
stars in France.



But all she wanted was to have a picture with two young soldiers 
wearing the American uniform.

While in France, I became interested in learning more about police 
duties and investigations. The Army saw that maybe I could learn some 
of the stuff that they were teaching, and I was reassigned to the Army 
Criminal Investigation Division. I took the lessons and skills I 
learned back to South Texas where I became constable later after my 
return from the military, and later I became sheriff in Wasis County, 
which is my county.

The Army experience shaped my life like nothing else has ever done. 
It sent me on the pathway to become a better human being, a better 
elected official, a better constable, a better county commissioner, a 
better sheriff, and a better Congressman. The training was hard and 
work was even harder, but the lessons were never lost.

Just as was true in the early 1960s, when a French movie star stopped 
to take a picture with a poor boy from South Texas, our soldiers are 
respected and admired around the world for their professionalism and 
dedication to each other.

I am proud of my service and my Army experience. I am also proud of 
today's soldiers as they continue to fight and win our Nation's wars as 
they have done for the last 235 years. From the private in Washington's 
Continental Army facing a mighty adversary to the sergeant leading a 
patrol through the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan, the strength of 
our Nation is our Army, and I am proud to be part of that legacy. I am 
proud to wish the Army happy birthday.

But you know, time has really changed. When I served back then in the 
1960s, I went to the draft board, and I volunteered to the draft 
because my father had passed away, and I had four siblings, two 
brothers and two sister. Jobs were scarce, and I volunteered to go and 
serve the Army.

Today is a different story. Today, we have all-volunteer services. 
You can join the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, the 
National Guard, the Reserves. They serve and they volunteer because 
they love our country, and this is why we're so proud of the young men 
and women who sacrifice so that you and I can enjoy the freedoms that 
we have in this country. And the day when we fail to recognize the 
sacrifices of these young men and women who serve, this is when the 
fibers of this country start to begin to deteriorate.



I am so proud to say that I served in the Army, and I wish everybody 
who is either serving now or have served in the past a happy birthday.

I reserve the balance of my time.
