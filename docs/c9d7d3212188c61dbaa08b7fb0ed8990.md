# HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES

`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 4 January 2007`

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to SGT James P. 
Musack of Riverside, IA, who tragically died as a result of a noncombat 
related incident while serving his country in Iraq. I am sure that all 
Iowans shared the same sense of sadness I felt when learning of the 
death of this young Iowa native. According to family and friends, he 
had found his calling in the military and all Americans owe him our 
deepest thanks for his service. Everyone joining the military knows the 
risks involved, but all Americans are indebted to brave patriots like 
James Musack who voluntarily assume those risks in order to defend our 
freedom and way of life. My prayers go out to his mother Yvette, his 
father Jim, and all his family and friends.











 Lieutenant Colonel Paul J. Finken
