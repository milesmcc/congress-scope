Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and of 
our troops. The tragedy in Iraq has gone on far too long. For 4 years, 
this administration and its supporters have put forth arguments based 
on misinformation and fear. I would urge my colleagues to remember this 
during today's debate.

This administration and the Republican leadership in Congress have 
presided over perhaps the biggest foreign policy and national security 
blunder in our Nation's history. They have ignored, shouted down and 
attempted to intimidate anyone who has dared to disagree.

And now, after 4 years, we see the thousands of brave Americans 
killed or seriously injured, untold numbers of Iraqis dead and the 
country in chaos.

Our troops have done everything, and I mean everything, that has been 
asked of them. But they have been let down by the administration that 
dishonors their tremendous service and sacrifice with its incompetence 
and arrogance.

Let us, please, finally make a change in Iraq. Let us end the war and 
bring our troops home.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill and support our troops.

I rise in strong support of this bill and of our troops.

The tragedy in Iraq has gone on far too long.

This legislation would bring our involvement there to an end.

I have listened now for more than 4 years as the administration and 
its supporters up here have come forward with one reason after another 
for: why we have to invade, why we have to stay, and what will happen 
if we ''fail.''

They've never made sense to me. Their arguments have been based 
either on misinformation or fear.

The Bush administration has stumbled and bumbled, dissembled and 
distorted on Iraq so much that no one--no one--believes a word it says.

Last night, NBC News quoted a Republican Congressman telling the 
President that ''word about the war and its progress cannot come from 
the White House or even you, Mr. President. There is no longer any 
credibility.''

That is the reality.

So I would urge my colleagues, as they listen to this debate and hear 
from the Republican leadership and White House why the McGovern bill or 
the Supplemental Appropriations bill are so wrong, to remember this 
history.

Mr. Speaker, this administration and the Republican leadership in 
Congress have presided over perhaps the biggest foreign policy and 
national security blunder in our Nation's history. They've ignored, 
shouted down and attempted to intimidate anyone who has dared disagree.

After 4 years we are left with thousands of brave Americans killed or 
seriously injured, an untold number of Iraqis dead, and the country in 
chaos. Most tragically, the cost for all these mistakes has been borne 
by the men and women who wear the uniform, and their families.

Our troops have done everything--everything--that has been asked of 
them. But they have been let down by an administration that dishonors 
their tremendous sacrifice with its incompetence and arrogance.

Let us please, finally, make a change in Iraq. Let us end the war and 
bring our troops home.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to support our troops.
