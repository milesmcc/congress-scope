Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, when President Bush sent American troops to 
war in Iraq, he had an obligation to ensure they were cared for if they 
came home wounded. Unlike in past wars, medical technology and 
protective gears have advanced to the point that soldiers who would 
have died in the past are now surviving devastating combat injuries. 
Their survival, of course, is a great development. Unfortunately, as 
the case at Walter Reed shows, many of our injured soldiers are not 
receiving the treatment they need and deserve when they return home.

We should all be outraged at what is happening at our military 
hospitals. Fortunately, this Congress is taking action. At the end of 
this week, House


committees will have held four hearings on the inadequate treatment our 
wounded soldiers are receiving at Walter Reed. We are now learning that 
this is more widespread than Walter Reed, and we must explore major 
reform options that fix this problem immediately.

Inadequate oversight of the Bush administration by past Congresses 
allowed these conditions to develop. The new Democratic Congress is 
going to hold those responsible accountable and ensure that our 
soldiers receive the help they have more than earned.
