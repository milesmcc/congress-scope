# SUPPORT AMERICAN TROOPS

Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the American soldier has always protected 
this Nation from those seeking to destroy our freedoms. U.S. soldiers 
go to the vast plains of combat. These troops forge onward into the 
fires of battle. They ensure generations of Americans that our 
interests will be protected around the world. Our volunteers expect 
their government to support them.

Now some Members of Congress talk of cutting funding to the American 
soldiers engaged in the desert battles of Iraq, and they want to pull 
our soldiers out a few at a time. This ill-advised political decision 
will leave U.S. soldiers abandoned and at the mercy of an enemy that 
will exploit this weakness.

But this action by Congress is not new. A previous Congress did not 
like the way a war was going and tried to change the policy and tried 
to change the plan. That Congress even complained about funds for the 
war and wanted a new leader.

Good thing that commander pressed on and won the war. He said to 
those skeptics and cynics in Congress, ''We should never despair. Our 
situation before has been unpromising, and has changed for the better. 
So it will again.'' The war was the War for Independence, and the 
Commander in Chief was George Washington.

And that's just the way it is.
