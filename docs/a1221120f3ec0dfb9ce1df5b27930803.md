Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, it seems that President 
Bush and many of his allies still don't understand how things have 
changed on the ground in Iraq.

A few days ago the Republican leader, when asked about the 
President's new escalation plan, said that if it doesn't work, the 
President pretty soon is going to have to present to Congress and the 
American people what plan B is.

Well, there are very few people that don't realize by now that we are 
not on plan B anymore; we are on plan Z. And we have got to start 
asking ourselves why plan A and plan B all the way through plan Z still 
haven't worked. It is because a military plan, without diplomatic and 
political reinforcements behind it, cannot work on the ground in Iraq. 
That is what the Democrats in Congress have realized. That is what the 
Iraq Study Group realized. That is what legions of retired generals 
have realized.

Madam Speaker, it is time the President and his allies join that 
hegemony of opinion and join us in setting a new course in Iraq.
