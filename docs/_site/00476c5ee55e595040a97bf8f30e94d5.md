`Mr. SMITH of Texas â€” 18 September 2008`

---


Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, by a 5-to-1 ratio, Americans 
believe the media are trying to help Senator Obama win the Presidency. 
The following partial list of the ''Best of the Worst'' examples of 
media bias shows why Americans are right to be concerned.

One, Senator Obama has led Senator McCain in news coverage for 12 
consecutive weeks, according to the Nonpartisan Project For Excellence 
in Journalism.

Two, journalists who gave money to Senator Obama outnumber those who 
contributed to Senator McCain by a 20-1 margin, according to Investors 
Business Daily.

Three, while the media often label Governor Palin ''conservative,'' 
they rarely call Senator Obama or Senator Biden ''liberal,'' even 
though the National Journal ranked Senator Obama as the most liberal 
Member of the Senate and Senator Biden as the third most liberal Member 
of the Senate.

Four, the New York Times opinion editor, a former staff member in the 
Clinton administration, refused to publish an op-ed by Senator McCain 
about the Iraq war, just days after publishing an op-ed on the same 
subject by Senator Obama.

Five, although the media criticize Senator McCain for running 
negative TV ads, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Advertising Project found 
that 77 percent of Senator Obama's recent ads have been negative, far 
more than Senator McCain's.
