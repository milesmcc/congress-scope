Mr. REID. Madam President, I have had conversations with the two 
managers, Senator McCain and Senator Levin. I would hope people who 
feel strongly about the amendment that is pending; that is, the habeas 
corpus amendment, would come and speak on this amendment. The floor is 
open for debate on that issue. It is an extremely important amendment. 
No matter how you feel about it, it is important--whether you are for 
it or against it. I would hope Senators would come and talk about that 
amendment.

I have also spoken with Senator Levin and Senator McCain about how we 
proceed from this point forward. We have been somewhat tepid in moving 
forward because we did not know how the vote would turn out on the DC 
voting rights. We know that now, so we are moving ahead as quickly as 
we can on the Defense authorization bill because that matter is out of 
the way procedurally.

What I have spoken to the two managers about is that we would have 
the Defense authorization bill, and as a sidetrack, we would have Iraq 
amendments--a finite number from the Democrats, a finite number from 
the Republicans. We would work on time agreements for those amendments. 
Our floor staff is trying to draw something up and submit that to the 
Republican leader. I have not today--even though I have spoken to him 
in the past about that--spoken to him about that, although we have 
spoken to Senator Kyl, Senator McCain, Senator Lott, and others. The 
distinguished Republican leader was simply off the floor at the time. 
So our two staffs are coming up with something in writing to see if 
there is a way we can move forward on that; otherwise, we will offer 
them as part of the Defense authorization bill.

On this matter, I have the greatest comfort level with Senator 
Levin's ability to manage this bill. He has, in years past, done such a 
remarkably good job. For many years, it has been Senator Warner working 
with him. Now, because of the change in the ranking membership of that 
committee, it is Senator McCain, who also is very experienced. So we 
should be able to move this legislation along, I hope, quickly.

There is a lot to do on this bill, and I would hope Members on this 
side would listen to what Senator Levin has to say and come when it is 
to their interest, and maybe even sometimes when it is not to their 
interest, but at least in an effort to dispose of this legislation.
