`Mr. KAUFMAN â€” 2 March 2010`

Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise again to pay tribute to one of 
our Nation's great Federal employees.

From the day of its creation as the first executive department in 
1789, the State Department has carried out the important work of 
American diplomacy, pursuing peaceful relations between the United 
States and other nations around the world. When our role as a world 
power grew in the late 19th century, our diplomats became peacemakers 
among nations. Since the end of World War II, we heavily invested our 
time, treasure, and human capital in the preservation of global peace 
during a time wrought with potential for war and mass destruction.

Today, in the aftermath of the Cold War and the September 11 attacks, 
our State Department personnel, and our Foreign Service officers in 
particular, work tirelessly to promote the American values of liberty 
and international cooperation.

Stationed in every region, they daily endure risks to their health 
and safety. They leave behind family and a familiar culture. These 
talented and dedicated men and women are the living embodiment of 
President Kennedy's declaration that, while we must never negotiate out 
of fear, we must never fear to negotiate.

Those in the Foreign Service must pass a rigorous examination and be 
prepared to serve in any of our 250 posts around the world. They have 
jobs as consular officers assisting Americans abroad, political or 
economic officers analyzing trends in foreign countries and promoting 
U.S. interests, management officers running our embassies or public 
diplomacy officers who share the story of America with foreign 
audiences.

The most senior and successful diplomats may become ambassadors, the 
public face of our Nation and the President's personal representatives 
abroad.

One distinguished Ambassador whose career exemplifies the work of our 
Foreign Service is Anne Patterson.

A native of Arkansas, Anne studied at Wellesley College and the 
University of North Carolina. She first joined the Foreign Service in 
1973 as an economic


officer. Her initial postings overseas included Saudi Arabia and the 
United Nations offices in Geneva, Switzerland. From 1991 to 1993, Anne 
served as the State Department's Director for Andean Countries and 
later was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Inter-American 
Affairs.

In 1997, Anne was nominated and confirmed as Ambassador to El 
Salvador, where she served for 3 years. She became our Ambassador to 
Colombia in 2000. While escorting the late Senator Paul Wellstone on a 
visit that year to a rural town, an explosive device was found nearby 
by local security forces. That incident underscores the reality of the 
many dangers our Foreign Service officers face while serving overseas.

Anne returned to Washington in 2003, where she served as deputy 
inspector general for the State Department. The following year, she was 
appointed Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New 
York. After U.N. ambassador John Danforth resigned in January 2005, 
Anne became acting ambassador, representing the United States at the 
United Nations. She continued to serve in that role for 6 months.

From 2005 to 2007, Anne led the State Department's Bureau of 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. In May 2007, after 
Ambassador Ryan Crocker left Islamabad to take up his post in Iraq, 
President Bush nominated Anne to serve as our Ambassador in Pakistan. 
She continues her work in Islamabad to this day, representing our 
Nation at a time of great importance with the United States-Pakistani 
relationship.

During the times I have had the honor of visiting her and our Embassy 
officials in Pakistan, I have been impressed by her dedication to 
furthering Americans' priorities in that country, to protecting our 
national security interests, and to managing our talented team on the 
ground.

The life of a Foreign Service officer is not easy. Anne and her 
husband and her two sons and stepdaughter can attest that Foreign 
Service families face many challenges during a career of living 
overseas and moving frequently. In addition, Foreign Service families 
must make significant sacrifices to serve in dangerous locales, such as 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq, where there are restrictions on 
bringing spouses and children to post. These officers serve in the face 
of great hardship, not for financial reward but for the satisfaction of 
serving the United States of America, protecting its interests, and 
promoting peace among nations.

I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the enormous 
contribution made by Ambassador Anne Patterson and all those who serve 
in the Foreign Service and the State Department.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
