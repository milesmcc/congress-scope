Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.

I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 84, sponsored 
by my friend and colleague from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp), a resolution 
supporting the goals and objectives of National Military Appreciation 
Month.



Each May since 1999, Congress has taken the time to honor our 
Nation's bravest men and women serving in the Armed Forces. Throughout 
our history, they have put themselves in harm's way all over the world 
in order to protect and defend our country. They continue to do so 
today, and they deserve our gratitude.

In the wake of the tragic shooting yesterday at Camp Victory in 
Baghdad, we are reminded of the perils and the stress that our Armed 
Forces face constantly during periods of deployment. It is important, I 
think, that we always show our appreciation for their service, but as 
we continue to face two long wars, they need and deserve our support 
now more than ever. I am glad we are taking the time today to thank 
them for their service, and I know that all my colleagues keep them and 
their families in our thoughts and prayers.

This measure was introduced this year on March 26 by Representative 
Wamp of Tennessee and was referred to


the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The committee 
reported the bill by unanimous consent on May 6, and it comes to the 
House floor today with the bipartisan support of over 75 cosponsors.

Mr. Speaker, every single day our soldiers, sailors, airmen and air 
women, marines, and their families, make tremendous sacrifices in 
service to our country. I have seen this firsthand on many, many 
deployments by these soldiers during my regular visits to Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

Our country is at war, and our military is certainly deserving of our 
support now more than ever. Today I ask my colleagues to join all 
Americans in giving thanks to our men and women in uniform.

Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 84 gives us the opportunity 
to show our appreciation and respect to members and veterans of the 
armed services, men and women that hail from all walks of life but are 
bound together by one noble characteristic and take one simple but 
profound act. They have put on the uniform of our country, and they are 
together committed to protecting Americans and their liberties that we 
hold so dear.

Thus, to the military personnel from my own congressional district 
and to those of every congressional district represented in this body, 
we sincerely thank you, our men and women in uniform, for your service 
to our country.

With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.
