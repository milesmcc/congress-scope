Mr. McCOTTER. Congress still holds the power of the purse. If the war 
is not funded, the war cannot continue. That's perhaps a position I 
disagree with, but it is a factual matter. If you are serious about 
this, you would do that.

Or you would have a straightforward vote on funding the troops to 
ensure that we continue to move forward and that America is not 
defeated in Iraq. You would have dealt with the McDermott bill and sent 
it to the President despite his veto threat because he has also 
threatened to veto this legislation. There would be much Republican 
support for this. And then you would deal with the veterans in the way 
they should be.

Now many friends of mine are Blue Dogs. You were not questioned on 
your patriotism when you determined that this money for veterans had to 
be offset. No one said you cared more about big government than 
veterans. I would suggest that those of us who want to make sure our 
economy recovers and do not want to tax it into submission and 
decimation should not have any patriotism questioned about supporting 
veterans by opposing tax increases and instead looking for cuts in 
Federal pork to pay for it.
