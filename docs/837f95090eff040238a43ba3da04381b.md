Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats owe our majority to the 
American public who voted us into power for one simple reason; they 
trusted us. They trusted us to act boldly to hold this administration 
accountable and to bring our troops home. So far, we're failing the 
very trust that they've placed in us.

But, more importantly, every day that we allow this occupation to 
continue, we are failing our brave young men and women, those who are 
serving honorably and professionally in Iraq, and we are failing their 
families here at home who are struggling to keep their lives and 
families together, who are forced to worry whether their loved ones 
will come home alive or actually in one piece.

Today is not an opportunity to claim victory or to give bellicose 
speeches for partisan debate. Today is an opportunity to grieve for the 
soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for this President who has 
failed Iraq in his policies.

Today is a day to stand by our Nation's sons and daughters who suffer 
through irreparable physical and mental wounds.

Vote ''no.''
