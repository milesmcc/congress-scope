Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, General Petraeus is a good man 
and an excellent soldier, and the MoveOn advertisement's personal 
attack on the general was completely inappropriate. I respect the brave 
service, commitment and sacrifice of the men and women who wear the 
uniform and would never disparage them. It is disappointing that the 
general and the rest of our troops have been put in an impossible 
position by the failed policies of President Bush and I continue to 
believe the United States should wind down its involvement in Iraq, 
help bolster the Afghanistan government, and eliminate bin Laden and 
those who did attack us on September 11th.
