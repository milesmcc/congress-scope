`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 5 February 2007`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Barney 
Frank, for organizing this Special Order, and I want to thank him for 
his beautiful words paying tribute to Father Drinan as well as my other 
colleague from Massachusetts, Ed Markey, for his very beautiful words 
honoring a truly great man.

I feel truly privileged to have known Father Drinan. As was made 
clear by the previous speakers, he was a remarkable man, remarkable in 
his incredible faith and remarkable in his strong political beliefs.

I think all of us who knew Bob Drinan will miss him; however, I 
believe that even those who didn't know Father Drinan personally will 
feel a great sense of loss, because we have lost a man who was truly 
dedicated to good. He was a man of unbelievable intellect, of 
unbelievable conviction and compassion. He also was a man with a great 
sense of humor.

You know, the day after his passing, I delivered a tribute to him on 
this House floor, and I recalled his early and steadfast opposition to 
the war in Vietnam and his most recent opposition to the war in Iraq.



He thought both wars were senseless and moral blunders. Father Drinan 
was someone who spoke his mind, regardless of the political polls or 
political consequences. Indeed, many of his closest allies would 
caution him to be careful in some of his pronouncements on some of the 
more controversial issues that he took on.

But even when his words were controversial, he had this kind of 
uncanny knack of usually being proven right; and whether it was the war 
in Vietnam or whether it was his call for the impeachment of Richard 
Nixon, he turned out to be right, on those issues and so many other 
issues.

I admired his commitment to peace and human rights. Whether it was 
speaking out on behalf of Jews who were being persecuted by the former 
Soviet Union or, as mentioned, whether it was his advocacy on behalf of 
so many people in Central America who were victimized by the wars that 
engulfed that region of the world in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
nobody was more dedicated to human rights than Bob Drinan.

When raising his voice in Congress and trying to change U.S. policy 
was not enough, he would travel to the countries where people were 
being oppressed to speak out. Those of us who were involved in El 
Salvador during the 1980s recall with great admiration his visit to 
that country in the midst of a civil war where he said mass alongside 
of Archbishop Oscar Romero. Only a few months after that visit, 
Archbishop Romeo was murdered by Salvadoran death squads.

We also remember in 1989 when six Jesuit priests were murdered by the 
Salvadoran military. I was working for Congressman Joe Moakley at the 
time, who was investigating those killings. Father Drinan spoke up 
forcefully, demanding justice in that case.

It is also important to note that his service to people did not end 
when he left the House of Representatives. He continued to advocate for 
what was right and just in his teachings, his lectures, his numerous TV 
appearances and his writings.

Many of us would get calls from him, Did you see my piece in the 
National Catholic Reporter, he would ask, or we would get letters 
citing specific passages in a book that he wrote or a book that he read 
or some article that he thought was worth mentioning. He would 
sometimes suggest we use the material in a speech or perhaps insert 
something in the Congressional Record. He never stopped making a 
difference.

I have also had the privilege over the years of attending many 
dinners with Father Drinan. He always kind of held court. All the 
attention focused on Father Drinan because he was brilliant, and he had 
well-thought-out answers to every single policy question that ever 
existed.

Over the last several days, I have attended his calling hours at 
Georgetown University and his funeral mass at St. Aloysius Church here 
in Washington. I was struck by how many people whose lives he had 
touched. So many of them had dedicated their lives and their careers to 
public service and education. He inspired people, and the only thing 
that he scorned was indifference.

Mark Gearan, who was a former staffer of Father Drinan and who 
actually met his wife Mary Hurley working on Father Drinan's campaign, 
is now the President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in New York, 
and he recently wrote an article that appeared in the Boston Globe 
entitled, ''Father Drinan was our unfailing champion.'' I would just 
like to read a passage here:

''But for me and countless others, it was his role as a mentor that 
distinguished Father Drinan. Amid the pressures of tough campaigns and 
congressional duties, he always reached out to young staff and 
encouraged their interest in politics and policy. He took time to ask 
your opinion on issues and was genuinely interested in knowing why you 
felt that way. 'Tell me something I don't know,' he would bark out in 
an elevator ride or driving to the airport. A tough assignment to 
respond to the author of 12 books with such a keen and inquisitive 
mind.''

I recall one time attending a speech that Father Drinan gave before 
the Americas for Democratic Action here in Washington, D.C. When his 
speech was over with, he asked me what did you think. I said it was a 
great speech. He said what specifically did you like about the speech. 
I had to think for a minute.

But the bottom line was Bob Drinan was not interested in just empty 
plaudits. He wanted to know what moved people, what worked, how to get 
things done, how to move an audience.

This country is better off, not just because of Father Drinan. This 
country is better off because of the countless people he brought into 
the political process, people who love this country, people who want to 
make a difference, people who want to change it for the better.

Several years ago, I attended a graduation commencement ceremony, and 
the late John Kenneth Galbraith was the speaker, and he said to the 
audience of students, I would ask you to go out and comfort the 
afflicted, but given the current political climate that might be 
considered eccentric. So instead I will ask you to go out and afflict 
the comfortable.

That is what Father Drinan did, and that is what we are going to 
miss, a truly great man who did some extraordinary things not only for 
this country but for people all over the world.

Let me close as I began by saying I feel it a great privilege I had 
the opportunity to get to know this wonderful man, and I thank my 
colleague.
