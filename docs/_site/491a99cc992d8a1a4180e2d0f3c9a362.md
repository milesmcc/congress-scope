Mr. REED. I had the opportunity this morning to listen to the 
majority leader, Harry Reid, as I presided. He made it clear that he 
would be perfectly willing to allow a 50-vote majority vote on both the 
Levin-Reed amendment and the Cornyn amendment or the proposed McConnell 
amendment. I think if there is any attempt to obstruct the will of the 
Senate, it is by those who are suggesting that we must have a 60-vote 
threshold. I think Senator Reid made it clear that he would be happy to 
entertain a limited debate and a majority vote on the Levin-Reed 
amendment, the Kyl amendment, or other amendments that may be 
appropriate on the policy in Iraq.

I also understand at this moment, under the pending unanimous 
consent, the Senator from Illinois is to be recognized.
