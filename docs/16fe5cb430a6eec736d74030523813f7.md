Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, this week, President Bush confirmed what I 
have known for some time: He is delusional. Twenty-thousand more troops 
in Iraq? No one supports this escalation: not the Join Chiefs of Staff, 
not the Iraq Study Group and certalnly not the American people.

This administration has made mistake after mistake in an unnecessary 
war of its choosing. Now the President insists on sacrificing more 
lives, more money, and more goodwill on an increasingly lost cause.

If God really does talk to this President, I wish God would tell the 
President to ''Bring the troops home now!'' This is what the Iraqis 
need and it's what the American people overwhelmingly declared they 
wanted in November.

President Bush is incapable of managing the debacle in Iraq. Congress 
must therefore take matters into its own hands, blocking funding for 
the ''surge'' in particular and stopping all funding for the war in 
Iraq in general. Let's bring our troops home.
