Mr. KIRK. I appreciate the chairman's work. I also appreciate David 
Fite's work on this because we were together when we first saw how this 
restriction could impede the hunt for the two top al Qaeda terrorists--
Ayman al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden.

For a poorly paid official--and there are many who are patriotic, 
good servants in Afghanistan and in Pakistan especially--we ought to be 
able to offer this reward. This will significantly incentivize the hunt 
for some of the people who have killed most of the Americans. I urge 
adoption of the amendment.

I yield back the balance of my time.
