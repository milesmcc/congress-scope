Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thank you to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin.

Mr. Speaker, there are 435 Members of Congress, and I know there are 
many people on the other side of the aisle who don't know who I am. I 
am Patrick Murphy, and I am from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Back home, 
my wife and my daughter Maggie are watching, probably on C-SPAN right 
now.

Over 13 years ago, I wore the United States Army uniform for the 
first time. I was able to live the American dream. I was able to rise 
through the ranks and become a captain and a paratrooper in the 82nd 
Airborne Division. We had a saying in the Army: Lead, follow or get out 
of the way.

Well, in the past 4 years, the Republican-led Congress followed. They 
had their chance, and they followed lockstep as this President led our 
country into an open-ended commitment refereeing a religious civil war.

For the last 4 years, this Republican Congress followed lockstep as 
my fellow soldiers continued to die in Iraq without a clear mission, 
without benchmarks to determine success, without a clear timeline for 
coming home. In the last 4 years, the Republican Congress followed this 
President as thousands of brave American soldiers returned home in 
coffins with our American flag. Nineteen of those coffins had soldiers 
that I served with in Iraq, 19 paratroopers.

Mr. Speaker, with this bill, with this vote, we mark the end of that 
error.

Many of the 49 new freshmen, both Democrats and Republicans, were 
elected a few months ago on the promise of new leadership, and that is 
what this bill does. It leads our way out of Iraq. It leads the way to 
rebuild our overextended Army, and leads the way to win the war on 
terror.

To those on the other side of the aisle who are opposed, I want to 
ask you the same questions that my gunner asked me when I was leading a 
convoy up and down Ambush Alley one day. He said, ''Sir, what are we 
doing over here? What's our mission? When are these Iraqis going to 
come off the sidelines and stand up for their own country?''

So to my colleagues across the aisle, your taunts about supporting 
our troops ring hollow if you are still unable to answer those 
questions now 4 years later.

Mr. Speaker, to vote ''no'' on this bill is to stand idly by, to let 
our commitment to Iraq remain open-ended and to let countless more 
American soldiers be killed in the sands of al-Anbar and the streets of 
Baghdad.

Short-term political peril may sidestep those who cast their vote for 
the status quo, but our children's history books will not treat them 
kindly, nor should they.

Mr. Speaker, the 110th Congress will be judged whether we have the 
political courage to put forth a plan to restore accountability and 
oversight, to bring our troops home from Iraq and, most importantly, to 
win the war on terror.

This is our opportunity. This is our chance to lead. For too long, 
the American people have been craving leadership, craving 
accountability and craving a new direction in Iraq. Let's give that to 
them today.
