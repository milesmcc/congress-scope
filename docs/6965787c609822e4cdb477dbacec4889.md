Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Reconstruction fraud has run rampant during the engagement of the 
U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States has devoted more 
than $50 billion to relief and reconstruction activities there, and at 
least $8.8 billion cannot be accounted for.

Some of the reports of excessive profiteering are simply appalling. 
For example, one contractor was hired to build the Baghdad Police 
College, a facility to house and train more than 4,000 police recruits. 
After spending $72 million of U.S. taxpayer money, the contractor 
delivered an engineering nightmare with so many plumbing problems that 
auditors from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction 
said that during the visit a substance dripped from the ceiling onto an 
assessment team member's shirt.

It's not only construction. There are widely reported stories of 
contractors double-charging taxpayers for sodas and overcharging the 
government 600 percent for fuel shipments.

Another report has a company running convoys of empty trucks back and 
forth across an insurgent-laden desert, pointlessly risking the lives 
of soldiers and drivers so the company could charge the taxpayer for 
phantom deliveries. Truckers referred to their cargo as sailboat fuel.

Inspector Generals have opened hundreds of investigations into fraud 
and waste in Iraq and Kuwait and Afghanistan involving illegal 
kickbacks, bid-rigging, embezzlement and fraudulent overbilling.

The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has more than 
70 open and active investigations in contracting fraud and abuse in the 
war. In addition, private whistleblowers have filed numerous civil 
claims involving Iraq fraud under the False Claims Act.

Despite the breadth of all of these investigations and civil claims, 
the Department of Justice has chosen to pursue a relatively small 
number of cases. To promote a more vigorous Department of Justice 
prosecution of reconstruction fraud, the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. 
Abercrombie) has introduced H.R. 400, the War Profiteering Prevention 
Act of 2007.

Although there are anti-fraud laws to protect against waste of U.S. 
taxpayers' money at home, no law specifically prohibits war 
profiteering or expressly confers jurisdiction of U.S. courts to hear 
the fraud cases when our forces and reconstruction efforts are deployed 
overseas.

To clarify the full reach of the U.S. jurisdiction to appropriately 
punish this conduct wherever it may occur, H.R. 400 would criminalize 
overcharging taxpayers to profit excessively with the intent to defraud 
the United States Government or any provisional authority, such as the 
former Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.

This crime would be a felony, with criminal penalties up to $1 
million in fines and up to 20 years in prison. In addition to 
prohibiting fraud, H.R. 400 also criminalizes false statements in 
providing goods and services in connection with the war or 
reconstruction effort. This crime would also be a felony, subject to 
criminal penalties up to $1 million and up to 10 years in prison.

The bill before us makes a few technical changes to the bill that was 
reported out of committee. Among them is a deletion of a provision 
providing for an alternative fund of twice the gross profits or other 
proceeds of the crime.

This alternative fund essentially duplicates and would possibly 
displace a stronger current provision in the law, section 3571(d) of 
title 18 of the U.S. code, which applies to all crimes.

But also note that the bill explicitly provides for an 
extraterritorial jurisdiction. The inclusion of this provision is meant 
to make it abundantly clear that this statute reaches war profiteering 
crimes wherever they may occur. However, it is not intended and should 
not be interpreted to undermine the extraterritorial reach of any other 
Federal criminal statute.

H.R. 400 sends a resounding warning, which I hope would be heard and 
taken to heart by all relief and reconstruction contractors doing 
business with the U.S. Government or any provisional authority 
operating under our control, that is, that contracting fraud not only 
undercuts our missions overseas, it is illegal. If you engage in it, 
you can expect to be vigorously prosecuted.

I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
