# DOVER POLICY
## `5535ccd0d175d23f124be7e2451ba26f`
`Mr. HUNTER â€” 26 February 2009`

Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege last night to meet with 
Angelia Phillips. Her son, Specialist Michael Phillips, was killed in 
Iraq on February 24, 2008, with the 1st of the 502nd, 101st Airborne. 
She was adamant, Mr. Speaker, when she was talking about the Dover 
Policy. That's the policy that we have right now that does not allow 
the media to take pictures of our soldiers, marines, sailors and airmen 
coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. She said that that return of her 
son, Specialist Phillips, his returning to America, that was him coming 
home and to her, that was more important than the actual funeral 
because that was finally her son coming home to his country that he 
loved so much and that he gave his life for.

The Dover Policy is good policy. The American public does not need to 
see the flag-draped coffins of those who carry the burden of freedom 
for this country. It's up to that family because that's a special 
solemn moment, Mr. Speaker. The Dover Policy is good policy. We should 
not reverse it.
