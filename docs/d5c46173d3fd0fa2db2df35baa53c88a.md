Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week was an 
extraordinary week of success for America in promoting nuclear 
nonproliferation.

On Friday, the North Koreans destroyed the cooling tower at their 
Yongbyon nuclear complex. This, plus other recent concessions by that 
regime, will lead to additional aid for the people of that impoverished 
nation.

In India, the U.S.-India civilian nuclear agreement appears to be 
closer to approval. This is an important step to bring clean nuclear 
energy to the citizens of fast-growing India.

In Iraq, there was the removal of the last remnants of Saddam 
Hussein's nuclear program when 550 metric tons of yellowcake, the seed 
material for higher-grade nuclear enrichment, was shipped to Canada.

However, the threat of Iran continues to grow. The Iranian Government 
has confirmed it will not comply with the U.N. Security Council 
resolutions requiring it to stop enriching uranium.

It is encouraging to see the people of North Korea, India and Iraq 
benefit from moral cooperation, but it is sad to see the misguided 
government of Iran further isolate its civilian population and put them 
at risk.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
