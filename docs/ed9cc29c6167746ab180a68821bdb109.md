`Mr. LEWIS of California â€” 1 July 2010`

---


Mr. LEWIS of California. I yield myself the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, let me begin by reminding the Members that this 
supplemental originally was sent to us by our Commander in Chief, the 
President of the United States, Barack Obama.

I understand the concerns about the war in Afghanistan. I have 
similar concerns, especially following the recent turmoil regarding 
command changes. But I also have full faith and confidence in our brave 
and selfless men and women fighting over there.



The President knows that war is tough and a dirty business. But our 
forces, although tired, are eager for the opportunity to succeed and 
more than capable of doing so.

I have in my hand a Statement of Administration Policy from our 
Commander in Chief, Barack Obama. In it, his advisers suggest, if this 
amendment is a part of the bill, that they will be recommending to the 
President that he veto this bill.

Indeed, it is time for us to recognize that the war on terror is very 
real. The challenge in Afghanistan is supported by the President 
because he recognizes it's very real, and it's one of the bases of 
operation for their activities. In fact, I believe that we have to let 
conditions on the ground dictate the process, as General Petraeus just 
testified this week, even if those conditions require forces to stay 
past the President's July 11 withdrawal date.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
