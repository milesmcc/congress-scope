`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 5 February 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say that there are many Members 
on my side who would argue we should not be having this debate this 
week at all. I hope none of those watching this on C-SPAN or any people 
in the gallery are confused. A 60-vote threshold is routine in the 
Senate. It is the ordinary, not the extraordinary. There was really 
only one exception to that, and that was the consideration of judicial 
nominees. My good friends on the other side of the aisle spent an 
enormous amount of time in the last couple of years trying to establish 
a 60-vote threshold for that as well.

There is nothing the minority is asking for that is in any way 
extraordinary, nothing extraordinary about it at all. It is really 
quite ordinary. We are prepared to have a debate on Iraq this week. We 
look forward to having a debate on Iraq this week. What should happen 
is the distinguished majority leader and myself should agree, by 
consent, to a reasonable number of resolutions. As I have indicated, 
some of the Republican Senators have given up their opportunity to 
offer proposals in deference to my request that we narrow down the 
number of resolutions to a reasonable number for consideration this 
week.

I hope that one of two things would happen: Either we vitiate the 
vote this afternoon because it is completely unnecessary or we will 
defeat cloture and the majority leader and I, hopefully, will be able 
to sit down and reach agreement for a fair consideration of alternate 
proposals that could have been reached last Friday and I had hoped 
would have been reached last Friday.
