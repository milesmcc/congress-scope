Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to speak on what I call 
''The Daily 45.''

The Department of Justice reports that on average, every day here in 
America, 45 people are shot and killed in a fit of revenge, robbery or 
troubled relationships. These are more than our soldiers who are killed 
in Iraq and Afghanistan each and every day.

Today I reflect on a story that has captured the hearts and the minds 
of Chicago area residents. On Saturday, February 2, the day began like 
any other day for six unsuspecting women. Five of these women, 
customers and workers at a Lane Bryant clothing store in the southwest 
suburbs of Chicago, were heartlessly murdered during an apparent midday 
botched robbery attempt by an assailant wielding a gun.

37-year-old Connie Woolfolk, 42-year-old Rhoda McFarland, 22-year-old 
Sarah Szafranski, 33-year-old Carrie Hudek Chiuso, and 34-year-old 
Jennifer Bishop should not be forgotten. Neither should we forget the 
sixth woman who was shot in the neck, but survived.

When will America say, ''Enough is enough''? Stop the killings.
