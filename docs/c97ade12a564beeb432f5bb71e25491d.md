`Ms. LEE â€” 21 June 2007`

---


Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, while I understand that the Chairwoman is 
prepared to accept it, this amendment causes me great concern.

Given Mr. King's history in opposition to the underlying provision, I 
believe that this amendment is nothing more than a backdoor attempt to 
leaving U.S. troops in Iraq long-term.

The bottom line is, Mr. Chairman, when our troops come home, they 
should all come home.

And three times, twice in 2006 and once this year Congress passed--
and the President signed into law--legislation prohibiting permanent 
military bases in Iraq.

The prospect of having long-term military bases would send the wrong 
message to our troops, the Iraqi people, and the world.

The prospect of an indefinite occupation fuels the insurgency by 
serving as a recruiting tool for insurgents and places targets on the 
backs of our troops.

The Iraq Study Group has recognized the importance of unequivocally 
declaring that we have no intention of remaining in Iraq permanently.

Key administration officials, including Secretary Gates have 
pronounced that we are not


going to establish permanent military bases in Iraq.

Even President Bush has declared that we 'do not support an 
indefinite occupation' in Iraq.

Again, Mr. Chairman, I wish this were a genuine attempt to prohibit 
an indefinite occupation in Iraq.

I'm concerned that it is not.
