`Mr. CASEY â€” 13 July 2007`

---

 Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I honor COL Stephen L. Hill 
and the exceptional service he has provided as commander of the 
Pittsburgh District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the period 
from July 16, 2004, to July 13, 2007. My colleague from Pennsylvania, 
Senator Specter, has joined me to honor Colonel Hill.

On Friday, July 13 in Pittsburgh, PA, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers Pittsburgh District military Change of Command ceremony will 
honor the services of the outgoing commander, COL Stephen L. Hill, and 
welcome the incoming commander, COL Michael P. Crall.

Colonel Hill will leave a legacy of excellence. His leadership 
focused the district's capabilities on executing vital programs for the 
region and the Nation. His superb managerial skills and emphasis on 
building relationships and encouraging open and honest communication 
increased confidence in the


ability of the district to accomplish its mission.

During his tenure as district commander, the district's workload 
expanded and its annual operating budget increased from less than $100 
million in Fiscal Year 2004 to over $184 million in Fiscal Year 2007. 
Colonel Hill skillfully managed resources and reengineered district 
processes to efficiently accomplish the planning, engineering, 
construction, operation and maintenance of Pittsburgh district's 23 
locks and dams, 16 multipurpose reservoirs, local flood protection 
projects and environmental infrastructure projects covering 26,000 
square miles and portions of five States.

Colonel Hill knew that an important aspect of commanding the district 
was developing relationships with key leaders in the region. He took 
the time to meet with officials, visit projects, evaluate the issues, 
and work to understand the various perspectives of the experts in the 
region. He established and improved relations with local, State and 
Federal officials, culminating in changes to outdated lock and dam 
operating schedules, resulting in cost savings and efficiencies. 
Colonel Hill's partnerships resulted in the revitalization in projects 
affecting the critical waterways in the Lower Monongahela and Upper 
Ohio River. He championed efforts with the Upper Ohio River Study, 
Asset Management, Charleroi construction, the district's Strategic 
Business Initiative, SBI, and a number of other high priority projects. 
These efforts and accomplishments greatly improved the district's image 
and reputation among the public, stakeholders, congressional staff and 
the workforce.

Colonel Hill recognized the importance of working across and beyond 
the district's boundaries. He led by example, deploying to Louisiana to 
assist in the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort, serving as part of 
Task Force Hope. More than 25 percent of the Pittsburgh District team 
members also deployed to assist in the hurricane recovery effort.

Colonel Hill's exceptional service reflects great credit upon 
himself, the Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Army.

Colonel Hill's next duty assignment is Commander of the gulf region 
South District at Base Camp Adder, Iraq. The South District covers more 
than 65,000 square miles, manages more than 1,500 projects that are 
valued at over $3.3 billion. Colonel Hill will oversee 107 U.S. 
military and civilian professionals, 263 contract security personnel 
and nearly 124 Iraq professionals who work side-by-side to provide the 
transitional support in order to create a viable and stable democracy 
in the country.

Pennsylvania has been honored to experience the leadership and 
passion that COL Stephen Hill provided to the Pittsburgh District. 
Along with my colleague, Senator Specter, I thank the colonel for his 
service to our country and wish him a safe tour of duty in Iraq and 
much success throughout his entire career.

I ask to have printed in the Record a biography of Colonel Hill.
