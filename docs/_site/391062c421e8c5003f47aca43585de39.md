Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Iraqis to 
stand up and defend themselves.

Mr. Speaker, we have freed them from a ruthless dictator. We have 
lost more than 3,000 lives. We have more than 20,000 wounded. We have 
helped them to construct a constitution, to reestablish their 
constabulary. We have helped them hold an election, and we are spending 
more than $177 million, not per year, not per month, not per week, but 
per day.

It is time for them to stand up and defend themselves. Do not send 
20,000 in; bring 20,000 troops home. It is time for them to stand up 
and defend themselves.
