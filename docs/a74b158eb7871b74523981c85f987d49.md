Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just wanted to congratulate my three 
colleagues for taking that trip. It is of the utmost importance that my 
colleagues are able to see the situation on the ground, meet with our 
leaders, meet with the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and meet 
with the men and women who are serving in the military.

One thing I know is, the word spreads. The word spreads throughout 
the men and women of our military that Senators took time from their 
schedules, from our recess, to be with the men and women who are 
serving. There is no better way to express our appreciation, but also 
it is very much noticed by the men and women serving over there.

I know my colleagues come back better informed. Also, as the 
situation in Afghanistan continues to evolve, we will be much more 
qualified and informed as we engage in what is appropriate for the 
Senate to engage in--discussion and debate over our strategy and our 
goals in Afghanistan.

So I thank my colleagues for going. I thank them for their service. 
The Senator from Delaware has proven that even a former Navy person can 
understand the issues that confront the Army and the Marine Corps.
