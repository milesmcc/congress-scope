Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor an American soldier who was wounded in service to our Nation 
during the conflict in Afghanistan. Army Ranger Romulo ''Romy'' Camargo 
is a member of the United States Army who served with honor and 
distinction on the battlefield.

Moving to Citrus County as a third-grader, Romy spent the majority of 
his adolescence in Crystal River. He graduated from Crystal River High 
in 1993, where he captained his swim and wrestling teams.

He spent the past 14 years in the Army, eight of which with the 
Special Forces, and served three tours in Afghanistan. Last year while 
serving second in command of his team, Operational Detachment Alpha 
7115, his squad was ambushed. Chief Camargo sustained a gunshot wound 
in the back of his


neck. He was treated for his injury at Walter Reed Hospital and later 
transferred to Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa. This Saturday I, 
along with his family, friends, and neighbors have the great honor of 
welcoming him home.

Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I thank Romulo Camargo 
for honorably defending the freedoms that all Americans hold dear. 
While Chief Camargo was fighting for freedom and liberty, his family, 
friends and loved ones were praying for him back home. They and this 
Congress will not soon forget his bravery and commitment to our 
Country.
