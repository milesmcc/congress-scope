Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time.

Madam Speaker, I thank those who have spoken today. I, too, thank the 
staff of the majority and minority on the Veterans' Committee for 
preparing this legislation.

Madam Speaker, our veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq will 
require a range of services and assistance in making the transition 
back to civilian life. We will take up many issues related to those 
veterans. We will take up issues of war and peace here on the floor.

In the meantime, we should remind all employers, both in the 
government sector and in the private sector that hiring veterans is a 
smart choice. Their discipline, their work ethic, their prior service 
to our Nation make them excellent employees. I know. I have a couple 
working for me. They are superb.

We should pass this legislation for Hire a Veteran Week because we 
owe it to those who have borne the battle. We owe it to our country. 
Employers owe it to their stockholders and their clients and their 
customers, and they owe it to themselves.

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that I hope will 
become a reality soon so that we will have a Hire a Veteran Week in 
America.
