Ms. CLARKE. Madam Speaker and my colleagues, the State of the Union?

Mr. President, we are on edge. The American public have said no to 
the war in Iraq and you have turned a deaf ear to this American 
admonition.

What does a troop escalation mean to American families?

More of our women and men, sons and daughters, brothers and sister, 
neighbors and friends will lose their lives or the life of someone they 
love, more families, such as the family of Operations Specialist Joseph 
Alomar, who gave his life in honor just this past week, and LCpl 
Nicholas Whyte, who gave his life this summer. More families, Mr. 
President, will be mourning. More of the American tax dollars will be 
spent on the war, rather than on building better schools, hospitals, 
roads and bridges.

Madam Speaker, in the 11th District of Brooklyn, New York, and in 
congressional districts around the country, Americans want our troops 
home.

Mr. President, end this war in Iraq. Redeploy our troops now. We need 
our domestic tranquility.
