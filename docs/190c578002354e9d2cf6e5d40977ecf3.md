# UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST
## `190c578002354e9d2cf6e5d40977ecf3`
`Mr. DURBIN â€” 6 February 2007`

Mr. DURBIN. If I might continue through the Chair to ask the Senator 
from Nevada a question, on the issue that I think is before America 
today--whether we should escalate the number of troops into this war in 
Iraq--we had offered to the Republican side a choice between two 
Republican amendments: Senator Warner's amendment, which said the 
President's policy is wrong, and Senator McCain's amendment, which says 
the policy is advisable and should be followed. Even given the option 
of two Republican amendments, the Republican minority, yesterday, voted 
to deny any opportunity for the Senate to debate two Republican 
amendments?
