# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mr. MEEKS of New York â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. MEEKS of New York. Mr. Speaker, there is a concept from the 
people of West Africa called Sankofa. Literally translated, it means, 
''It is not taboo to go back and fetch what you have forgot.''

Today, I want to use the premise of Sankofa and go back to some of 
the things that have occurred in the recent past with regard to Iraq so 
that we can learn from those lessons. In order to know where we need to 
go in Iraq, we have to evaluate what missteps have been made. That is 
our responsibility.

As we look at the last 5 years, the President has shown no accuracy 
on the challenges we face in Iraq. While our soldiers are courageously 
carrying out their orders, it has become apparent that military action 
to bring security to Iraq has reached its limitation, but our President 
insists on escalating military force.

I recall over 4 years ago hearing the President and the 
administration push for war with talk about a smoking gun that would 
come in the form of a mushroom cloud. The administration pulled on the 
emotions of the public while our Nation was still in shock from 9/11. 
Our President pushed for war with arrogance. ''Bring it on,'' he said. 
Coalition of the willing. Deck of cards. Freedom on the march. Mission 
accomplished. A plan for victory. Those are just some of the promises 
that have been made, but the administration has not been able to make 
good on those promises. It is fair to say that the President has 
defaulted on a promissory note.

Today, the question before us is can the President make good on the 
promise of security in Iraq with an escalation of the combat operation. 
All of the facts point to a strong ''no'' on that question.

After reviewing all of the facts, I saw that increased troops did not 
work in the spring of 2004, when troop levels were raised by thousands, 
but this did nothing to prevent the continued uprising, and April of 
2004 was the second deadliest month for American forces. I have heard 
from generals, former Secretaries of State, and a bipartisan 
commission, all saying that escalation will not work. I am vehemently 
opposed to the escalation of the Iraq war and its open-ended commitment 
to a failing effort.

The President only accepts the advice of those who agree with him. 
After months of threats and a long military build-up, the United States 
attacked Iraq on March 19, 2003. The administration cut short U.N. arms 
inspections after a war-sanctioned resolution failed by a wide margin 
to gain support in the U.N. Security Council. Because the President 
could not get the U.N. or the world public in support of an invasion, 
he developed his unilateral preemptive doctrine.

The President has had generals tell him that this war should end and 
an escalation is not the answer; but when he gets advice he doesn't 
like, he simply fires the generals.

He has had a commission of experts advise him that a diplomatic 
political effort with all of Iraq's neighbors would be the most 
effective way to enable the U.S. to move its combat forces out of Iraq 
responsibly. However, the President did not like that advice, so he has 
chosen to simply ignore it.

When the President needed Congress to approve military action against 
Iraq, he cared about the perspective of the Congress then. As Congress 
begins to conduct oversight of the combat operation, the President 
wants to ignore the voices of dissent that come from this very body.

The cameras of history are rolling, and I hope and pray that at the 
end of this debate history can record that this body, starting with 
this resolution as a first step, has taken the appropriate action to 
end a morally wrong war that threatens to irreversibly stain the fabric 
of Congress if we do not exercise our constitutional authority and our


patriotic responsibility to balance the President's power.

To move forward and bring security to Iraq will require a bipartisan 
effort; it will require dialogue with Congress, dialogue between 
Congress and the administration, and dialogue and diplomacy between 
Iraq and all of its neighbors, as the Iraq Study Group wisely 
recommended. I am reaching across the aisle to my colleagues who also 
believe that military action has its limitations and a diplomatic 
offensive will bring a new and critical approach to secure Iraq.

This war has created deep humanitarian crisis in Iraq and a deep 
political crisis in the international system. Based on all that has 
happened leading up to this war and since its commencement, I cannot in 
good conscience support any escalation of military force in Iraq. But I 
plan to move forward with a strong push for a diplomatic effort to a 
problem that military action simply has not been able to solve.

Some ask what will happen in Iraq if we leave, but the more 
fundamental question is, what will happen to Iraq and the United States 
if we stay.

Dr. King, when speaking on Vietnam once said, ''A time comes when 
silence is betrayal. That time has come for us in relation to 
Vietnam.'' I echo those sentiments today. If Congress is silent while 
the President escalates the war in Iraq, we betray the American people, 
we betray the American soldiers, and we betray our constitutional 
responsibility.
