Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of my 
constituents, LCpl Robert Draper.

Lance Corporal Draper recently returned from Haditha, Iraq, where he 
served a 7-month deployment. He was assigned to Company E of the Second 
Battalion, Third Marine Regiment of the United States Marine Corps.

The city of Haditha saw unprecedented improvements when Lance 
Corporal Draper's Company E served. Upon arrival, Haditha was 
considered one of the most dangerous regions in Iraq. By the end of 
Lance Corporal Draper's deployment, the police force was rapidly 
growing, attacks on Iraqi Police and Marine patrols were steadily 
decreasing, and relations with the Iraqi people were improving.

Madam Speaker, please join me in paying tribute to Lance Corporal 
Draper, whose selfless actions benefit all Americans. Our Nation owes 
Lance Corporal Draper and his fellow soldiers a great debt of gratitude 
for their service.
