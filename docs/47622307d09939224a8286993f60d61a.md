`Mr. BOOZMAN â€” 19 December 2007`

Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise solemnly this afternoon to 
memorialize one of my constituents who's been described as one who 
makes this country great. I rise to remember Army Specialist Matthew 
Kyle Reece of Jasper, who passed away in Iraq in December of 2007.

Kyle Reece was born in Harrison and went to school in Jasper and 
Alpena. He fished, played ball and prayed while growing up in Newton 
County. His name can be seen in the Alpena gym, marking two 
championship teams, and his name will long be remembered for the duty 
he performed on behalf of his country, his friends and his family.

Kyle was a grenadier in the 82nd Airborne who deeply cared for the 
men in his charge. He accepted his duty proudly, telling his 3-year-old 
daughter before he left that he had to go to Iraq so she and everyone 
else in the U.S. could remain free.

There's no way we can adequately thank Kyle, or his family, for his 
service. However, I will take to heart the words of his wife, 
Chauntelle, who urges that we not wait until a soldier dies before we 
honor him. Rather, we should shake their hands and thank them for all 
that they do for America.
