Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Texas, did he attend 
the meeting in room 407, the closed meeting, where Secretary Gates, the 
Secretary of Defense, told us there was sufficient money in the current 
appropriations bill for the Department of Defense to continue the war 
in Iraq until at least the end of February or the middle of March so 
that it was unnecessary to pass the bill, which you have just asked me 
to consider, immediately?
