Mr. GRAVES. Madam Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Lance 
Corporal Jonathan R. Goodman, USMC, of Trenton, Missouri. Lance 
Corporal Goodman has recently returned from Operation Iraqi Freedom 
8.1, deployed to Camp Habbaniyah, Iraq with the 2d Battalion, 24th 
Marines. As a marine, he has served his Country honorably and well.

I, his friends, and family are extremely proud of his service to our 
Country and welcome him home at a special meet and greet celebration on 
September 13, 2008 at the local VFW Hall #919 in Trenton, Missouri.

Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in recognizing Lance 
Corporal Jonathan R. Goodman, USMC, who is a true inspiration for all 
that know him. It is truly an honor to serve Lance Corporal Goodman in 
the United States Congress.
