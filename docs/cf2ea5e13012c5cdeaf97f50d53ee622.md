`Mr. JORDAN of Ohio â€” 24 July 2007`

Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I was returning from an official 
delegation trip to Iraq yesterday, and was therefore absent from the 
Floor during the four rollcall votes that took place on Monday night.

Had I been present, I would have voted in favor of H.R. 404 (the 
Federal Customer Service Enhancement Act), H. Res. 553 (Mourning the 
Passing of Lady Bird Johnson), and H. Res. 519 (Honoring the Life and 
Accomplishments of Tom Lea). I would have voted against ordering the 
previous question on H. Res. 558 (the rule providing for consideration 
of H.R. 3074).
