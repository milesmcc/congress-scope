Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am so happy to have the 
opportunity and the honor to rise this evening to lead the Special 
Order of the Congressional Black Caucus. We are going to be talking 
about Iraq.

I want to recognize first for comment the Chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, my colleague and good friend, the gentlelady from 
Detroit, Michigan, Congresswoman Carolyn Kilpatrick, and to thank her 
for her leadership of her wonderful caucus.
