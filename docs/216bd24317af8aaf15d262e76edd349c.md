Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I have a question for the Senator from 
Oklahoma.

I have a statement that applies to servicemen going off to war in 
Iraq from the State of Montana, which does not apply to this bill. It 
is a statement I want to make as in morning business. If the Senator 
from Oklahoma has something applicable to this bill and he is time 
sensitive, I would defer to him, if he wishes.
