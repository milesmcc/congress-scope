Mr. MEEK of Florida. Let's say I was to say hypothetically, Mr. Ryan, 
can I borrow $100?

Sure, Kendrick.

And I will pay you on Friday, payday, at the end of the month. And I 
see you 2 weeks after that payday and I come up to you. You are 
thinking, hold it, you owe me money when you see me next. You're not 
thinking about what I want to talk about.

Where is my chart on foreign debt held? We love charts here. I can 
tell you, on the foreign debt held, there are countries like Japan, 
China, OPEC countries, Mr. Speaker, that we borrow money from. Iran is 
in that number. So how are we going to be viewed on the world stage and 
how do we rebound from that?

Here is my chart. We keep the chart people in business.

China, Japan, leading the pack there. The U.K., the Caribbean, OPEC 
countries that include Iraq, Iran, Venezuela. You look at Korea, Hong 
Kong and Germany.

Again, Mr. Ryan, how do we look these countries in the eyes and say 
we want you to do this a certain way when we owe them money? How do we 
get out of that? We get out of it by passing this budget resolution 
that we passed today.
