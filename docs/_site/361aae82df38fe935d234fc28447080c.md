Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, here we are after Veterans Day still 
indecisive. Our soldiers continue to fight in Afghanistan. Winter is 
setting in. The commander of our Afghan forces laid out the plan to 
defeat al Qaeda and their Taliban terrorist pals. General McChrystal 
says he needs more troops to defeat the terrorists. The response has 
been months of indecision, doubt and delays that have encouraged the 
enemy. Losing Afghanistan to radical terrorists hangs in the balance.

So what's the holdup? Vietnam taught us that wars can't be won with 
political posturing. We owe our troopers a commitment to winning when 
we put them into the valley of the gun.

Churchill once said, ''As long as we have faith in our own cause and 
an unconquerable will to win, victory will not be denied us.'' It is 
that dogged determination, the will to win that is essential to victory 
and freedom's cause.

The courage and capability of America's fighting men and women are 
unequalled anywhere in the world. The only thing capable of defeating 
our military is politics.

And that's just the way it is.
