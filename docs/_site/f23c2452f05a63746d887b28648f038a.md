Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight two specific provisions 
that are included in this landmark legislation that we are discussing 
today.

This bill contains legislation that I, along with Congressman Tom 
Udall, offered as an amendment during initial House consideration of 
this bill. It will allow military families to use family and medical 
leave time to manage issues such as child care and financial planning 
that arise as a result of the deployment of an immediate family member.

This bill also contains the language from my bill, H.R. 1944, that 
requires the VA to operate a comprehensive program of long-term care 
for rehabilitation of traumatic brain injury, which has become the 
signature injury of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also creates 
and maintains a TBI veterans health registry.

These provisions will directly impact and improve the lives of our 
brave men and women in uniform and their families. I am proud that they 
have been included in this bill.
