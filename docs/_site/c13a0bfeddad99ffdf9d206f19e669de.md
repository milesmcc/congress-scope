`Ms. WOOLSEY â€” 11 December 2007`

Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, the holiday movie season usually begins 
each year around Christmas Day, but this year the holiday movie season 
has begun early. It began this week, in fact, when the administration 
premiered its new movie entitled, ''Iraq: The Sequel.''

As you will recall, the first Iraq movie began with the 
administration warning us about weapons of mass destruction and 
mushroom clouds. Then we invaded Iraq where we discovered that the 
weapons of mass destruction didn't exist. But the administration kept 
coming up with new reasons to keep the occupation going.

The American people gave this first Iraq two thumbs down, but that 
hasn't discouraged our leaders in the White House. They have been busy 
writing the same exact script for ''Iraq: The Sequel,'' which is all 
about Iran.

In this movie, the administration warns us about Iranian weapons of 
mass destruction, in this case a nuclear weapons program. Then it gives 
us new visions of mushroom clouds by warning us about World War III. 
Then we discover, as we did last week, that the nuclear weapons program 
does not exist. In fact, it was suspended back in 2003. But the 
administration continues to come up with new reasons to keep the crisis 
going.

Yesterday we were told that Iran was dangerous, Iran is dangerous, 
Iran will be dangerous. So the administration's drumbeat for war in 
general, and against Iran in particular, goes on. Before we go back to 
the dark days, Madam Speaker, the dark days of shock and awe, I have a 
few questions to ask.

First, why did it take 4 long years to discover the truth about the 
Iranian nuclear weapons program? Was this another example of 
intelligence being manipulated for political purposes?

Why did the administration warn us in October that Iranian nuclear 
weapons could start World War III when the Director of National 
Intelligence went to the White House in August to say that Iran's 
nuclear weapons system ''may be suspended''?

There is nothing, nothing more reckless and irresponsible than to 
terrify the world about World War III when there is no basis for it.

Why did the administration continue to use threatening language 
yesterday? Yesterday, when the truth was already known. Instead of 
looking for opportunities for peace, this administration continues to 
look for ways to keep tensions as high as possible.

My last question, Madam Speaker, is why does the administration seem 
so intent on wrecking America's credibility? By doing so, this 
administration has made the world a much more dangerous place and has 
undercut our own national security. We are like the boy who cries wolf. 
No one will believe what we say now, and that means we cannot lead the 
world effectively against terrorism and towards peace.

The movies of ''Iraq'' and ''Iraq: The Sequel'' have both bombed. We 
need a new plot, a plot that begins with responsible redeployment of 
our troops out of Iraq, which would be the essential, responsible first 
step.

When we do that, we can begin to bring together all the parties in 
the region that have a stake in keeping a lid on violence and reducing 
tensions. We must change course because that is the only way to regain 
the moral leadership. And we must reshape events, and we must reshape 
them in ways that are favorable to the United States and to peace 
around the world.
