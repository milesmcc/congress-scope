Mr. KUCINICH. There is a new way to fight war in Afghanistan. U.S. 
commanders are publicly telling the Taliban when we are coming and 
where we are going to be to wage war. This, while Karzai tries to cut a 
deal with the Taliban. Meanwhile, a large offensive is being mounted, 
an assault on Kandahar. The U.S. is going to have 100,000 troops 
mounted for a big battle by autumn. We're using 1.1 million gallons of 
fuel a day, logistical problems abound.

Here is a quote from the February 20 National Journal: So despite the 
immense effort to push out supplies, frontline fighters sometimes don't 
even have the minimum they need. ''We had guys out there at the outpost 
in an area of operations starving because we couldn't get a resupply 
into them,'' said one major.

Now, will the surge change that? And what's this all about? To 
strengthen and corrupt the central government which is building villas 
in Dubai?

I am bringing a privileged resolution to the floor to get out of 
Afghanistan, and I urge your support.
