Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor, not only our 
courageous men and women in uniform, but the students at Buford 
Intermediate Center in Mt. Vernon, IL, for their contributions to our 
service men and women.

The pupils at Buford personally welcomed home Zach Wood, Brian 
Gibson, and Tony Mays, all National Guard soldiers, from a 15-month 
deployment in Iraq. Along with welcoming home soldiers, the students 
are raising money for gift cards for soldiers who will be serving 
during the holidays. In addition, the students send care packages and 
letters to the soldiers to become acquainted with them.

After their welcome home, the soldiers took time to answer questions 
from the students ranging from fast food opportunities to the deaths of 
fellow soldiers to help students and faculty better empathize with the 
soldiers and their struggles.

Now, more than ever, our service men and women need the encouragement 
demonstrated by the students at Buford Intermediate School to show they 
are in our thoughts and prayers. We must demonstrate our support and 
admiration for their work and I thank these students for the example 
they have set for us.

I applaud the students at Buford Intermediate School for their 
service to our men and women serving in Iraq. May God bless them for 
their efforts and may He continue to bless America.
