Mr. PLATTS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in 
strong support of the amendment. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for 
offering this amendment.

Having had the privilege to visit our courageous troops eight times 
in Iraq and five times in Afghanistan, I know how much these care 
packages from home really mean to the troops, and how they look forward 
to them and what a morale boost it is.

I think recognizing this type of service, especially to those who are 
serving us in harm's way, is a wonderful amendment, a change to the 
legislation, and urge a ''yes'' vote.

I yield back the balance of my time.
