Mr. REID. Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will 
resume consideration of H.R. 627, the credit card bill. A rollcall vote 
will occur sometime within the next half hour or so. It may not occur 
immediately. When cloture is invoked, we will dispose of the pending 
amendments and then vote on passage of the bill, as amended. Rollcall 
votes are possible later in the day. We do know there are some 
agreements on a nomination, the Gensler nomination. There will be a 
vote on that nomination after the caucus lunches today at about 2:15 
p.m. Later this afternoon, we expect to begin consideration of the Iraq 
and Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill.
