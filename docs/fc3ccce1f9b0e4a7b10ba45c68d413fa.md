Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, this Monday, Memorial Day, gives citizens from 
around the country the opportunity to pause, come together, and 
remember those who have laid down their lives in protection of freedom. 
The debt we owe our Nation's members of the armed services, our 
veterans and their families can never be fully repaid.

Today we continue to be engaged in hostilities in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and young men and women will continue to pay the ultimate 
price for this Nation.

As a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard, I'm proud of the 
work we have done together in this Congress to support our veterans and 
military families. Although we have come a long way concerning care for 
our veterans, there's always more work to be done. We must ensure that 
our veterans do not fall through the cracks as they transition from the 
military to civilian life.

Back in Minnesota, as the 34th Infantry Division of the Minnesota 
National Guard prepare to deploy again to the Middle East, it's more 
critical than ever we back up those words with actions. We do so 
because it's the right thing to do for our veterans and the moral 
health of this Nation.

On behalf of a grateful Nation, we thank our current servicemembers, 
veterans, and their families for their service.
