`Mr. OBAMA â€” 27 March 2007`

---


Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we gather on another occasion to bring the 
Iraq war to its fateful end. While this effort may fall short again, we 
will continue to try to do what is in the national security of our 
country.

The Iraq war should never have been authorized. I was proud to say so 
in 2002, but I am even more proud of the plan I have offered that calls 
for combat to begin redeploying on May 1 with the goal of all combat 
troops out of Iraq by March 2008.

We also must make sure that we are not as careless getting out of 
this war as we were getting in, and that is why this withdrawal should 
be gradual, and keep some U.S. troops in the region to prevent a wider 
war in the region and go after al-Qaida and other terrorists.

Those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say 
that this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the American people. But 
the American people have been extraordinarily resolved. They have seen 
their sons and daughters killed or wounded on the streets of Fallujah. 
They have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort--money 
that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and 
our competitive standing as a nation.

No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this 
chaos, but a failure of strategy--a strategy that has only strengthened 
Iran's strategic position; increased threats posed by terrorist 
organizations; reduced U.S. credibility and influence around the world; 
and placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United States in 
the region in greater peril.

Iraq has been a failure of strategy and that strategy must change. It 
is time to bring a responsible end to this conflict because there is no 
military solution to this war.

Before we send our best off to battle in the future, we must remember 
what led us to this day and learn from the principles that follow.

We must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy. We must not 
embark on war based on untested theories, political agendas or wishful 
thinking that have little basis in fact or reality. We must focus our 
efforts on the threats we know exist, and we must evaluate those 
threats with sound intelligence that is never manipulated for political 
reasons again.

We must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense. It is a 
choice we sometimes have to make, but one that must be made rarely and 
always reluctantly.

We must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as 
planning for war. Iraq was not just a failure of conception, but a 
failure of execution. So when a conflict does arise that requires our 
involvement, we must try to understand that country's history, its 
politics, its ethnic and religious divisions before our troops ever set 
foot on its soil.

We must understand that setting up ballot boxes does not 
automatically create a democracy. Real freedom and real stability come 
from doing the hard work of helping to build a strong police force, and 
a legitimate government, and ensuring that people have food, and water, 
and electricity, and basic services. And we must be honest about


how much of that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the 
people themselves.

And finally, we must remember that when we send our service men and 
women to war, we make sure we have given them the training they need, 
and the equipment that will keep them safe, and a mission they can 
accomplish. And when our troops come home, it is our most solemn 
responsibility to make sure they come home to the services, and the 
benefits, and the care they deserve.

The cause to defend our country and our interests around the world 
will never end. It will be one of our country's constant threads 
through the ages. It is our sacred trust to ensure that those moments, 
those times of great struggle, are the right ones. And when they are 
not, we must continue to try and end those conflicts for the sake of 
our country, our service men and women, and the ideals we hold dear.

For these reasons, I strongly support the provision in the 
supplemental bill that calls for the withdrawal of American combat 
troops by March 31, 2008, and I will oppose any efforts to strip that 
provision from the bill.
