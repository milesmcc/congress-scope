Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, 4 years after the banner was unfurled, 
these are the missions that have been accomplished by the President:

America is more divided than at any time since the Vietnam War. The 
Iraq Government has before it a sweetheart deal that benefits Big Oil 
that the U.S. brokered behind the scenes. Read Josh Holland's 
investigative piece on alternet.com;

America is increasingly isolated in the Arab world, and countries 
that looked up to America now look out or look the other way. Read Rami 
Khouri's commentary published in the April 19 issue of the Daily Star 
in Lebanon;

The number of Pentagon contractors in Iraq who are profiting in the 
spoils of war, raking in vast sums of U.S. taxpayer money, nearly 
equals the number of U.S. soldiers. Read ''Iraq War: a Nice Little 
Earner'' in the Asia Times newspaper dated April 19;

Americans are so fed up with the President's state of denial that 
they returned Democratic majorities to the House and Senate last 
November. Read the April 26 editorial in my hometown newspaper, the 
Seattle PI: ''Iraq: Keep Speaking Out.''

Missions accomplished? All but the most important one: getting U.S. 
soldiers out of Iraq.

That is the will of the American people and the mission of the new 
Congress.
