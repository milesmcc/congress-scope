## `a1416908c529c331cbc5c7feac2b9d91`
`Mrs. DAVIS of California â€” 23 September 2008`

Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, as everyone has said before, 
this bill is a victory. It may not be everything that everyone had 
hoped to get into this bill, but it is going in the right direction. It 
does ensure treatment, it does address the stigma associated with 
mental health disorders.

I just wanted to point out that we have so many of our servicemembers 
who are coming home who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. And they 
are coming home and transitioning to civilian life. But they are going 
to find some barriers as well. The barriers to mental health care are 
really playing themselves out today because I just talked to a family 
just a little while ago, and they felt that even though we're starting 
to put in some of those services, there's great resistance to people 
seeking that kind of care.

This bill begins to change that. It sends a very clear and a very 
direct message that mental health care is as important as physical 
care. We wouldn't stop people in the middle of their treatment for 
something of stomach ulcers. You cannot stop people in the middle of 
their treatment for mental health disorders.

Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased this bill is on the floor.
