# FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `bf31532cee503155155beaa79e60d347`
`Mr. REID â€” 30 July 2008`

Mr. REID. I appreciate the statement of my friend from Arizona. I 
believe in these extenders so strongly that even though I would much 
rather have them paid for, we all know the debt has to stop someplace. 
As I indicated, the House of Representatives, to their credit, will not 
accept these not being paid for. That is the way it should be. We 
should not be running up massive deficits that the Bush 
administration--first year, second year, third year, fourth year, fifth 
year, seventh year, and now in the eighth year--is willing to accept. 
The war in Iraq, $5,000 a second; it doesn't matter.

We are where we are, but I am very disappointed that we are where we 
are. As I said, my Senators are waiting to hear from the Republican 
leader what he wants to do the rest of this week and into the future.
