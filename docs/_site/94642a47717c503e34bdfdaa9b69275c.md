`Mr. SAXTON â€” 19 April 2007`

---


Mr. SAXTON. I would like to thank Mr. Lewis for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, this vote to me is about Jacqueline, Kate and Allie. 
Most of you don't know Jacqueline, Kate and Allie. You see, they are my 
granddaughters, the next generation, the generation that will perhaps 
be most affected by this policy.



To many in this Chamber, I am afraid this vote is not about the next 
generation; it is about setting a date for surrender. I believe it is 
time that this House go on record and vote on whether emergency funding 
bills should have a troop withdrawal timeline.

I want to reiterate to my colleagues the message that we are sending 
if we include such a timeline in this bill. Make no mistake, it is 
nothing less than a date certain for surrender.

Some in this Congress believe that the withdrawal timeline will send 
a message to the Iraqi Government to get serious about taking the lead 
and stabilizing Iraq. This is a flawed argument. It is flawed because 
it fails to address the collateral effects, the other effects and 
damage this message will do to the Iraqi people, the United States, to 
our allies, and to future American generations.

A surrender timeline for our troops will send a very clear message to 
al Qaeda, to the Sunni insurgent groups, and to the Shiite militias in 
Iraq. It will tell them that Americans no longer have the stomach to 
see this through.

The Iranians, who are continuing down the road of development of 
nuclear weapon capability despite sanctions and international pressure, 
will also take note of our timeline. Ahmadinejad already believes that 
Americans are incapable of resistance. He has said so. Our partner 
nations in the Middle East are watching to see the level of American 
commitment to Iraq before they increase their level of assistance. If 
we tell them we are going to pull up stakes and go home in 2008, can we 
expect much support from Saudi Arabia, from Egypt, from Qatar, from the 
UAE, from Jordan? I don't think so.

A surrender timeline will cause us to lose credibility with our 
allies, our other allies in the war on terror. Al Qaeda's front man, 
al-Zawahiri, warned our Iraqi counterparts already that America is 
about to depart and abandon them, just as we abandoned our allies in 
Vietnam. A surrender timeline


will certainly degrade the level of trust and confidence that Iraqi 
soldiers have toward our forces. The negative effect of this surrender 
timeline on our troops will be significant as well.

Some in Congress say the war is already lost. We have heard that 
already. In my opinion, it is not. We are on the right track with a 
renewed strategy toward Iraqi security.

Fred Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute recently commented: 
''The conflict in Iraq is central to our foreign policy and our future, 
indeed, our well-being. Surely we must keep fighting to win,'' he said, 
''as long as victory remains possible. And it is possible although not 
certain,'' he said, ''that we will win in Iraq. Right now, the signs 
are more hopeful than they have been in many months. It would be a 
tragedy for America and for Iraq to abandon the fight just as the 
possibility of success begins to emerge.''
