# RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT

Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides a plan for 
responsible redeployment of our troops. This is the time to set a new 
course. Setting a date certainly gives the Iraqis the incentive to 
actually work to meet some benchmarks.

Our military men and women are among our most precious resources. 
They are performing admirably with courage in a situation that they 
never should have been asked to be in in the first place. They are 
doing their job. Now we must do ours. We must bring them home.

On a recent trip to Walter Reed to visit a seriously wounded marine 
from my district in Pomeroy, Ohio, I saw again the damage this war has 
done. Not just to this young man, but to his family also. They have all 
put their jobs and their lives on hold to care for him.

His courage and conviction are not in question. That marine would go 
back to Iraq tomorrow if we asked him to. We must not ask. How much 
more blood should be shed? How many more families must we shatter? 
Enough is enough.
