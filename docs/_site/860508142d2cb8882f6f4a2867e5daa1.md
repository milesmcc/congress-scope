Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is very difficult for me to believe 
some of the things I am actually hearing right now. In fact, I don't 
believe them after General Petraeus has made such a fine presentation 
to us. There are a few things in the closed session that we cannot talk 
about, but I have taken those out. The things we can talk about--in 
answer to a question, you said: Can you talk about some of the positive 
things that have happened?

He is talking about Anbar. I am now quoting: Anbar has gone from 
being assessed as being lost to a situation that now is quite 
heartening because of the decision by a number of Sunni Arab tribes to 
join the fight against al-Qaida; the reduction of sectarian murders in 
Baghdad, that is down by approximately a third; progress in Anbar is 
almost something that is breathtaking--the killing of the security


Amir of al-Qaida in eastern Anbar Province; the detention of the 
Khazali network; we have picked up the Shabani network head in Iraq. 
That is the explosively-formed projectile element in Iraq that gets 
them from others in Iraq, these are the explosively-formed projectiles.

It goes on and on. He talks about the progress in Ramadi.

My only wish is that so many of those who are detractors would have 
had the opportunity and had taken the opportunity to go and spend the 
time in the area of operations, in the whole area out there. But I can 
recall so many things that people just are not aware of here.

I remember being in Tikrit. Tikrit is where they had the Iraqi 
security forces building that was blown up. Forty of them were either--
these are Iraqi security trainees--40 either were killed or were 
injured so that they would not be able to go back to the fields. You 
know, the families--you do not hear about this--of all 40 of these 
supplied the one who had died with another member of the family. In 
other words, they have this commitment that is so strong.

I asked the general yesterday, I said: Are you still getting the 
family support that I witnessed when I was over there?

He said: It is even stronger now. They are lined up and talking about 
it.

The Iraqi security forces in Fallujah--now, that was a great 
experience that I had, having the honor of being there during two of 
their elections. The Iraqi security forces go out and vote the day 
before the rest of the public votes for two reasons: one, so they can 
provide security for the public when they vote, and the second reason 
is that they go out there knowing that is the risky time. They are 
willing to risk their lives, and several of them in the Fallujah area 
died just in the process of voting.

I remember sitting down with the general--his name is General Mahdi--
and he was one, I have to say--he was the brigade commander for Saddam 
Hussein. He hated Americans. He was the one who said--when they came in 
there after the fall of Saddam Hussein--he was still the brigade 
commander for the Iraqis until the marines came to Fallujah and started 
training with the Iraqi security forces. He made the statement--he 
said: We became so close to the marines--this is the general who had 
been Saddam Hussein's brigade commander. He said: We became so close to 
the marines that when they rotated out, we got together and we all 
cried.

We went from there on up, flew in a Black Hawk, and the easiest way 
to get around there is to fly low and fast over the Triangle, only to 
see the little kids down there waving American flags. I just wonder, if 
something like this is passed and we are telling all of those kids down 
there and we are telling the Iraqi security forces that are doing so 
well right now in their advanced training, that they are now on the 
point of these invasions that are taking place, the defenses that are 
taking place all throughout Iraq, that we are saying that we are the 
cut-and-run guys, we built up your hopes, we now see an improved Iraq, 
we see hospitals are opened, we see manufacturers that are making 
clothing, we see girls who are going to school when this has never 
happened in the history of Iraq, we have seen all of this progress, but 
we are going to dump on you now.

So I just hope that we can stand back from the politics and do the 
right thing and get a good resolution--defeat this bill, get it vetoed, 
get a good resolution so we can finish what we started and give General 
Petraeus a chance to finish what he has started so successfully.

I yield the floor.
