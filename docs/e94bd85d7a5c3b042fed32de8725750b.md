`Mr. ARCURI â€” 10 October 2007`

Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, over the last 7 years, President Bush has 
only vetoed four bills. The President's first two vetoes involved 
legislation that would expand Federal funding of embryonic stem cell 
research, which has the potential to unlock the doors to cures for 
diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer's. Two times, congressional 
Republicans sided with the President enabling his veto to stand and 
thereby denying hope to millions of American families.

The President's third veto came on the war funding bill that finally 
included a deadline to bring our troops home from Iraq. Again, 
Republicans sided with the President, and our troops continue to be 
bogged down in a war that the President himself says could continue for 
another decade. Then, last week, the President vetoed a fourth bill 
that would provide private health insurance to 10 million low-income 
children. It received strong bipartisan support in Congress, and there 
are enough votes in the Senate to override the President's veto.

The question now is will House Republicans once again side with the 
President or will they stand with the 10 million children who need and 
deserve health care.
