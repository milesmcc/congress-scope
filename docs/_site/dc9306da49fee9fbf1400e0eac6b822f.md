Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the administration now says it wants to 
talk to Iran. At the same time it is making plans to attack Iran. By 
saying it wants to talk to Iran and Syria, the administration appears 
to be reversing course after spending 2 months pumping the media full 
of anonymously sourced articles reporting to link Iran to the Iraq war.

Now it says it wants to talk. Making it appear that it wants to avoid 
another war. Right. Think about it. Aircraft carriers to the region, 
mine sweepers to the Persian Gulf, arming neighboring countries with 
Patriot missiles, ordering an increase in a


Strategic Petroleum Reserve, anticipating an oil embargo. When this 
administration puts the guns on the table and says let's talk, chances 
are it is going to shoot first and ask questions later, just like in 
Iraq.

Wake up, Congress. This administration is planning an attack on Iran 
with or without the permission of this House.
