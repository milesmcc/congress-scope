Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, as we are involved in this crisis with the 
economy, the world goes on. And part of the world is the war in Iraq.

Unfortunately, when I returned home to Memphis, I learned that one of 
our citizens, Private First Class Christopher T. Fox, United States 
Army, became the 4,178th casualty in the Iraq war. He was the ninth 
casualty from my District; a 21-year-old gentleman who went to Hamilton 
High School, whose stepfather lives in Memphis, Mr. Randall Hancock, 
and whose guardian is in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Private First Class Fox served this country admirably. He had a great 
love for the Army. He was due to get out in July, and looking forward 
to going to UT Knoxville in the fall. He played football at Hamilton 
High School. He loved his country.

The people of the Ninth District, the people of Shelby County, the 
people of Tennessee, and all of us in America appreciate his sacrifice 
and his service and join his family in grieving his loss. Thank you for 
your good deeds on Earth, Private First Class Fox.
