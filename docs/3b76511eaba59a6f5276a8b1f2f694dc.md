`Mr. HAGEL â€” 19 June 2007`

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss 
of U.S. Army SPC Adam Herold of Omaha, NE. Specialist Herold was killed 
on June 10 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his 
patrol in Karbala, Iraq. He was 23 years old.

Specialist Herold was the youngest of three brothers in a close-knit 
Nebraska family. He attended Roncalli High School and would later join 
the Job Corps in Utah to learn a trade.

In 2005, Specialist Herold made the decision to join the Army. He saw 
service in the Army as a means to a college education. But he also came 
from a family with a strong tradition of service to the country. Both 
of his grandfathers served in World War II.

Specialist Herold had been serving in Iraq since October 2006 with 
Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 377th Parachute 
Field Artillery Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, based at Ford 
Richardson, AK.

We are proud of Specialist Herold's service to our country, as well 
as the thousands of other brave Americans serving in Iraq.

He is survived by his parents Lance and Debbie Herold, and brothers 
Andy and Kyle, both of Omaha.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SPC Adam 
Herold.
