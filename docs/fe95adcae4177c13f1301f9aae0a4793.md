Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today we honor an ally who is 
standing with us in the Global War on Terrorism. An ally who knows what 
it is like to fight for peace and freedom, South Korea. Just over 50 
years ago, Korea was the most violent spot on the planet as the North 
Korean government, backed by the Soviets and Chinese, swooped in to 
destroy the fledgling democracy in the south.

I am a proud cosponsor of this resolution which recognizes the 
significant contributions that the South Korean military has made in 
Afghanistan and in Iraq. Our South Korean allies maintain the third 
largest contingent of personnel in Iraq, where they are helping each 
day to rebuild that nation and spread the freedom they too earned with 
blood, sweat, and grit.

While as many as 3,600 personnel have at some time served, currently 
2,300 work in the country to provide medical services, build and repair 
roads, power lines, schools, and other public works.

The Republic of Korea has contributed both men and money to 
rebuilding Iraq because they know how difficult it is to rise from the 
ashes of war. Since the end of the Korean War, the people of South 
Korea have built one of the world's most modern and dynamic economies.

We hope that the Iraqi and Afghani people can look to the South 
Korean model to develop into a peaceful and prosperous nation. We thank 
the Republic of Korea and the Korean people for their sacrifice and 
their stand for freedom.
