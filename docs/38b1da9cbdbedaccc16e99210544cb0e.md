Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have all seen recent news reports about 
security contractors in Iraq, specifically stories about Blackwater, a 
private company, which is under contract with the Department of Defense 
and the Department of State, perhaps other agencies, to provide 
security guards for American personnel and others who are in combat 
zones. There have been a lot of questions raised about questionable 
conduct and lack of oversight and a lot of questions about 
accountability. We need answers.

Last week, Secretary Gates of the Department of Defense, a man whom I 
respect, testified before the Appropriations Committee about the needs 
of the Department of Defense. I asked him a


series of basic questions about these security contractors: How many 
contractor personnel are on the ground? Who is there? How long have 
they been there? What oversight is in place? Who is in charge? I wanted 
to know who has oversight of these contractors and how the people are 
authorized to use deadly force, how they are held accountable for their 
actions. The Secretary's response was he didn't know.

The amendment I filed and hope to offer sets aside funding for the 
inspector general of the Department of Defense to find some answers. 
The amendment asks for a report that documents how much we are spending 
on private security contractors and how many people work for them.

The report also details the Department of Defense oversight role and 
the scope of authority of military commanders over private security 
contractors.

Finally, we need to know the basics. What laws govern the conduct of 
these contractors? What rules of engagement govern their activities? 
How is it possible we are in the fifth year of this war and still don't 
have these questions answered? Six years into the war in Afghanistan, 
and we still don't know for certain what the standards are.

The incident a few weeks ago in which Blackwater employees were 
involved in the deaths of eight Iraqi civilians raised a lot of 
questions. In response, let me recount what we have learned.

Since 2005, according to Government investigations, Blackwater has 
been involved in at least 195 ''escalation of force'' incidents; that 
is, situations in which Blackwater employees fired shots. That is an 
average of 1.4 shooting incidents per week.

In over 80 percent of these incidents since 2005, Blackwater's own 
reports document either casualties or property damage.

We have learned in one case the Iraqi casualty was shot in the head. 
In another, a Blackwater employee tried to cover up a shooting that 
killed an innocent bystander.

Perhaps the most disturbing incident that has come to light is the 
point-blank shooting of a security guard by a Blackwater employee in an 
off-duty confrontation. The Blackwater employee is reported to have 
been intoxicated and was fumbling with his weapon after the shooting.

Here is how the New York Times described the company's response:




 The acting ambassador at the United States Embassy in 


 Baghdad suggested that Blackwater apologize for the shooting 


 and pay the dead Iraqi man's family $250,000, lest the Iraqi 


 government bar Blackwater from working there, the report 


 said. Blackwater eventually paid the family $15,000, 


 according to the report, after an embassy diplomatic 


 security official complained that the ''crazy sums'' 


 proposed by the ambassador could encourage Iraqis to try 


 to ''get killed by our guys to financially guarantee their 


 family's future.''


So who has oversight of these security contractors? Whom do they 
answer to in Iraq and Afghanistan? What is their relationship to the 
military?

The old Coalition Provisional Authority under Mr. Bremer, who 
received a Gold Medal from President Bush, exempted security 
contractors from Iraqi law, and whether they are liable under U.S. law 
is murky at best.

If Blackwater employees are accountable under U.S. law, why hasn't 
there been one investigation or prosecution? Not a single Blackwater 
employee has been prosecuted. In fact, in the case of the drunken 
employee who killed the bodyguard of the Vice President, he was quickly 
spirited out of the country, apparently with our Government's blessing, 
to protect him from the Iraqis.

Stories such as these do not make the United States look good in the 
eyes of the Iraqis, in the eyes of the world, and, frankly, in the eyes 
of most fairminded American citizens. The number of shootings, the 
amount of Iraqis killed and wounded, the amount of property damage 
done--all of it suggests there needs to be a legitimate investigation.

I am not going to castigate every private security contractor in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. I have met some of them. Many of them are brave, 
dedicated, professional individuals who risk their lives to protect 
those whom they are charged to protect. Many are honest and dedicated. 
But the purpose of the amendment is to demand accountability. Private 
security contractors have to play by the rules--somebody's rules. If 
they don't, we as a government have to act.

These private security contractors are part of America's face in 
Iraq. This is a struggle to win the hearts and minds of those people 
and to create a peaceful society. Every time there is a reckless or 
illegitimate shooting of an Iraqi civilian, we take one step back from 
achieving that important goal.

I yield the floor.
