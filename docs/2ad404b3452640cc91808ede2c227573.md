Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of a new direction in Iraq.

For 4 years, Republican Congresses followed lock-step as this 
President led our country into an open-ended commitment refereeing a 
religious civil war on the streets of Baghdad and Iraq.

After the fall of Saddam Hussein, ensuring no weapons of mass 
destruction, and several elections, the Republican Congress still 
follows lock-step as my fellow soldiers continue to give the ultimate 
sacrifice in Iraq, without a clear mission, without benchmarks to 
determine success, and without a clear timeline for coming home. That 
ends in the 110th Congress. This is a defining moment.

Mr. Speaker, many of us were elected to Congress on the promise of 
new leadership. That is what the Iraq Accountability Act does. It leads 
the way out of Iraq, leads the way to rebuild our overextended Army, 
and leads the way to win the war on terror.

For too long the American people have been craving leadership, 
craving accountability and craving new direction in Iraq. Let's give 
them that with this piece of legislation.
