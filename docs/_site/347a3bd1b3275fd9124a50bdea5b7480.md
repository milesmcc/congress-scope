Mr. TANNER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, on August 5, 2010, 10 unarmed humanitarian aid workers 
affiliated with the International Assistance Mission, a nongovernmental 
organization operating a mobile health clinic for Afghans with little 
access to medical care, were brutally killed in Badakhshan province, 
Afghanistan.

There were six Americans among the murdered aid workers. These brave 
and selfless individuals, Cheryl Beckett, Brian Carderelli, Thomas 
Grams, Glen Lapp, Tom Little and Dan Terry, dedicated their lives to 
serving the people of Afghanistan.

Despite the grave danger that many humanitarian aid workers face, 
including from the Taliban, aid workers continue to operate in 
Afghanistan on behalf of the country's most impoverished and 
marginalized populations.

We urge all parties involved in the conflict in Afghanistan to 
respect the neutral status of humanitarian aid workers and urge the 
Afghan authorities to do their utmost to bring the perpetrators of this 
heinous act to justice.

The resolution before us today honors the sacrifice and the service 
of the brave and caring aid workers, doctors, and nurses who died in 
the tragic attack, and extends our condolences to the families of the 
victims.

I reserve the balance of my time.
