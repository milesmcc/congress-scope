## `a8781c0f3a2443779d34a49a33730677`
`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. KING of New York. Reclaiming my time, I never suggested 
unpatriotic. I said you are questioning the competency or credibility 
of the commander in Iraq, who was just confirmed unanimously by the 
United States Senate.

Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).
