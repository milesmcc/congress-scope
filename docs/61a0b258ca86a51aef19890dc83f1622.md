Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a 
hero: United States Marine Corporal Larry D. Harris, Jr. of Thornton, 
Colorado.

Corporal Harris, a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, 
graduated in 2003 from Boulder High School where he played football and 
ran track. He loved being an infantry Marine on the front line.

Corporal Larry Harris displayed heroism and service to others--both 
overseas and at home. He was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps 
Achievement Medal for helping civilians severely injured in an 
automobile accident near Camp Pendleton.

On July 1, 2010, while on patrol in Helmand Province Afghanistan, 
another Marine was shot in the leg. Picking up his fellow wounded 
Marine to carry him to safety Corporal Harris tripped an explosive 
device, absorbing the blast. Though he died in the explosion, his 
efforts saved the life of the wounded Marine.

Corporal Harris is a shining example of United States Marine Corps 
service and sacrifice. As a Marine Corps veteran, my deepest sympathies 
go out to his family and to all who knew him.
