# EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `5f8a48a37982708289603f2297c8b266`
`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 5 February 2007`

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Lincoln said at Gettysburg: ''We here highly 
resolve.'' It was a message of resolution, of steadfastness in the face 
of adversity, of hope over despair, and of confidence in the cause of 
freedom which is America's eternal cause. Today, in the depths of a 
terrible war, on the brink of a decisive battle for Baghdad, let us 
have a serious debate about where we stand and where we must go in 
Iraq. But that is not the debate this resolution of irresolution would 
bring.

The 60-vote requirement to close debate was put in place by our 
predecessors as a way to make it harder for the passions of a 
particular moment to sweep through the American people and across this 
Congress in a way that would do serious damage to our Nation in the 
long term. Because I believe this resolution, if passed, would have 
such an effect, I will respectfully oppose the motion for cloture.

I yield the floor.
