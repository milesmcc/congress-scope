Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that 
all of us want what is best for the men and women on the front lines in 
Iraq. Certainly it is disturbing when we find that there is a confusion 
in the reporting of the incident that saw the loss of life of 
approximately four or five of our soldiers. First, it was represented 
that they died in a battle fighting against the insurgents and others; 
later to be determined that they had been kidnapped and shot in the 
head execution-style.

This, of course, speaks to the failed policy of this administration 
that our soldiers can declare victory and be returned home, but more 
importantly it certainly is a shame when we cannot tell parents and 
loved ones and others how their loved ones fell in battle.

Certainly it is a shame that we find that our young men and women on 
the front lines may be subject to capture and execution, like being 
shot in the streets in a most disgraceful manner.

We must fix the broken policies of Iraq. Redeploy our troops, engage 
our allies in the region, begin a political diplomatic solution, and 
stop falsifying reports to the American people, not knowing how their 
loved ones are being executed in the streets of Iraq. I ask for a new 
policy in Iraq.
