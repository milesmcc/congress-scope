`Mr. PALLONE â€” 31 July 2007`

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding that this 
Congress take action to responsibly end the war in Iraq and bring our 
troops home safely. If the results of last November's election were not 
clear enough, a poll released last week indicates that a majority of 
Americans look to Congress and not the President to extricate ourselves 
from this dangerous mess. Day after day we hear about Republicans 
''questioning'' the President's stay-the-course strategy.

But mere words that grab headlines will not guarantee the responsible 
disengagement of our troops. Congressional action can and will.

Earlier this month, the House passed the Responsible Redeployment 
from Iraq Act, a plan that would bring our troops home by April of next 
year. Sadly, the measure received just four Republican votes. Rather 
than join our efforts, most Republicans continue to block meaningful 
attempts to end this war.

Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to raise questions, but actions speak 
louder than words. This week Republicans get another chance. I urge my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle to listen to the American 
people; take action now and bring our troops home.
