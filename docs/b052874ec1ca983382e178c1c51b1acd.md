Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to be an American. I 
am so proud that we have first amendment freedoms and this House of 
Representatives has decided to step up and debate the issue of Iraq. I 
am not ashamed that I want my troops to come home. I am not ashamed to 
say that the babies that have died in Iraq that come from Cleveland and 
Chicago, Illinois need to come home and get out of harm's way. I am not 
unpatriotic; I am as patriotic as the rest. I stand here to say to 
America today that the Democrats in this House of Representatives and 
the Democrats in the Senate want a debate.

Fortunately, we have a strong leader in the House and we are 
debating. Somehow, the Senate cannot seem to get off the stoop to give 
us an opportunity to debate the issue of Iraq. I am proud to be an 
American. I am proud to have troops who have stood up for us, have 
given their lives. It is time for us to stand up for them.

Let's remember them. Let them not be numbers. Let them and their 
families know that we care about them.
