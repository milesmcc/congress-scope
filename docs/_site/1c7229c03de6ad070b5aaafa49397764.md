`Mrs. BOXER â€” 28 March 2007`

---


Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have spent half a trillion dollars from 
our Treasury on the war in Iraq, and we know there are 3,000-plus dead, 
20,000-plus wounded. I think it is instructive to listen to what 
President Ronald Reagan once said. He said:




 History teaches that war begins when governments believe 


 the price tag of aggression is cheap.


Let me say that again:




 History teaches us that war begins when governments believe 


 the price tag of aggression is cheap.


Well, the Bush administration thought the price of this war would be 
cheap. They were wrong. We heard Secretary Rumsfeld tell Congress: The 
war will last 6 days, 6 weeks, I doubt 6 months. Budget Director Mitch 
Daniels said Iraq ''will be an affordable endeavor.'' And we remember 
the President saying, ''Mission accomplished,'' when it wasn't anywhere 
near accomplished. We remember Vice President Cheney proclaiming 
''they're in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.''

They were all wrong, and Congress has to weigh in. That is what this 
last election was about. We were weighing in with the help of a couple 
Republicans yesterday. We said to this President: Your one-man show in 
Iraq is over, Mr. President. You need to deal with the people of this 
country through their elected representatives. And don't issue these 
veto threats because that doesn't move us forward.

Senator Reid has asked the President to please meet with us; we can 
talk, we can work things out. So it is really up to him. He is wielding 
a veto pen because he doesn't like the fact that Congress has finally a 
spine to say, no, we are not going to have an open checkbook anymore 
for Iraq, we are not going to keep sending our troops over there to 
die, we are not going to put them in the middle of a civil war, we are 
going to change the mission in Iraq from a combat mission to a support 
mission.

We say to this President: Accept reality, please; it is time you do 
that. If you love the troops, you have to give them a mission they can 
accomplish. If you love the troops, you don't send them to moldy 
hospital rooms to recuperate from their injuries. And thanks


to the Senator from Washington, we have money in this bill to fix 
Walter Reed. If you love the troops, you don't send them back to fight 
with a post-traumatic stress disorder and a bottle of antidepressants.

We will give the troops what they need, but we will also be heard 
when we say: Don't put them in the middle of a civil war, Mr. 
President. Give them a mission that works, a support mission, to train 
the Iraqis. It is their country. They have to stand up and fight. We 
can no longer do it for them. And that was the importance of 
yesterday's vote.

In this bill, we do a lot of good things. We deal with the problems 
we are facing in Iraq. We say we ought to change the mission and make 
it binding and give a date that says, yes, start bringing the troops 
home and a goal for when we will bring them all home, except for those 
limited missions.

It is a smart piece of legislation, I say to the President.

And, yes, don't forget America. Don't forget the people, the ''salt 
of the Earth'' people who are suffering because of this freeze. I will 
show a few more pictures as I wind down on my time.

My State was devastated by the freeze. It left thousands of farm 
workers without employment. One of my constituents, a 46-year-old 
single mother of two in Tulare County, spent years working in the 
citrus fields and now has no job.

In this picture we can see the ice icicles near these avocados.

A look at this picture tells a thousand words. We can't turn our 
backs on these people. We can't turn our backs on our salmon fishermen 
who have been suffering so much. We can't turn our backs on the 
American people.

In conclusion, we have to serve as a check and balance on the 
Executive. When this Executive says it has an open checkbook for Iraq, 
nothing for America, we say: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. President. That is 
not right for the American people. Look at the people who have been 
suffering because of natural disasters. Look at for what we are 
supposed to use emergency appropriations bills. Come to the table with 
us. Don't wave your veto pen because we have a spine and we stand up 
for these people and we stand up for our fighting men and women. Come 
to the table, we say, let's work things out.

If we read the Constitution, that is exactly what we are supposed to 
do.

I was interested to hear Senator Hagel talk about the fact that this 
is not a monarchy, and he is right. We already had one King George, and 
that was enough.

It is my sincere hope that the President will respect the rule of the 
people and come to the table. I strongly support this bill, and I will 
vote against any amendment that hurts the people.

I yield the floor.
