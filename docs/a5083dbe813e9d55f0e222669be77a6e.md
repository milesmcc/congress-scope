Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the little fellow from Iran, Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad, is ranting and saber rattling again against Israel and the 
United States.

The L.A. Times reports the dictator said, ''The Zionist regime of 
Israel . . . is about to die and will soon be erased from the scene''. 
And, ''The time for the fall of the satanic power of the United States 
has come and the countdown to annihilation . . . has started.''

The devil of the desert is preaching hate and murder in the name of 
radical Islam. Throughout history more people have been murdered, 
pillaged, tortured, and plundered in the name of religion than any 
other reason.

With Iran's dictator's involvement in supplying aid against the 
United States in Iraq, his support of Hezbollah, and his desire to have 
nuclear weapons to use against Israel, the world of nations must not 
diminish this loose cannon's evil ambition.

Freedom-loving people of all nations and religions must see the 
dictator as a menace. Hopefully, the people of Iran will replace their 
trigger-happy leader with a regime that wants peace.

In the meantime Ahmadinejad should never doubt the United States' 
resolve for a safe and secure Israel. The U.S. will do whatever 
necessary to keep the flame of liberty burning at home and in the 
Middle East, even if the little fellow doesn't like it.

And that's just the way it is.
