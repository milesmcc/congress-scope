`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 17 February 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. All of us remember he said: Do not rush me. I want to 
talk to the generals. I want to talk to political leaders. I want to 
talk to people all over this country and all over the world to find out 
a new policy.

Then he comes out with this policy. And what is it? It is a military 
policy to escalate in Iraq.
