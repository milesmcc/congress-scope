# CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES
## `de8020d60f0630fd0bf8f7ac9e9a38b9`
`Mr. HODES â€” 24 October 2007`

Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I can't help but think about the importance 
of the power of the purse. James Madison said, ''The House of 
Representatives can not only refuse, but they alone can propose the 
supplies requisite for the support of government.''

The power over the purse is our weapon to use, and I am hoping that 
this Congress will no longer be the President's enabler when it comes 
to his misguided policy in Iraq. Earlier this week, he asked for an 
additional $46 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, bringing 
the total request this year to almost $200 billion. By the time we are 
done, we are going to be at $2.4 trillion in Iraq. That is enough to 
provide college educations for every student who wants to go to a 4-
year college for free at a private college or university. We could 
provide health care for every American for a year for the money we are 
spending.

It is going to be up to Congress to make tough decisions on whether 
or not we are going to use the power of the purse to take charge of 
this President's misguided policy.

So I am in contact and intimate sympathy with my constituents in New 
Hampshire who have said to me loud and clear, ''Do something to stop 
this President's policies in Iraq.''
