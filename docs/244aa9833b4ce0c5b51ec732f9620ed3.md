Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senators from Oregon for unwavering support 
of our men and women in the Army National Guard. We all recognize and 
are deeply grateful for the service that the National Guard has 
provided in domestic disasters and international conflict. It is well-
documented that the Stryker brigades have indeed performed 
exceptionally in Iraq. The House has added over $1 billion for 
Strykers. Your and your colleagues' views on Strykers for the Guard are 
noted and will be taken into consideration as we enter into conference.
