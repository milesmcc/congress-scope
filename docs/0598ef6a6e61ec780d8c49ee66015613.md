Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 92nd anniversary 
of the independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan, celebrated on May 
28th.

Located in a highly political, dynamic and sensitive region between 
Russia and Iran, Azerbaijan is a proud ally of the United States. An 
emerging democracy, Azerbaijan has taken the world stage as a member of 
the Council of Europe, the United Nations, and the Organization of 
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

A strategic partner of the United States, Azerbaijan works with the 
U.S. on major economic and security matters. Most profoundly, 
Azerbaijan has been an ally for the United States in terms of sending 
troops to Iraq and Afghanistan. They work with area nations to secure 
borders and deny illegal trafficking, and are an important component of 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program.

Their robust oil market provides western nations the means to power 
our economies.

I thank the nation of Azerbaijan for their continued journey towards 
democracy, and for their enduring strategic partnership in the region 
and around the world.

The United States congratulates all Azerbaijani citizens, and 
Azerbaijanis around the world, on the occasion of the 92nd anniversary 
of Azerbaijan Republic Day.
