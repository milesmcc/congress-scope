Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, is the gentleman asserting that all of 
the troops who were in Humvees in 2003 and 2004 had armored Humvees or 
that they had all of the troops deployed in harm's way, and, by the 
way, being in Iraq is in harm's way wherever they may be, had 
sufficient body armor? Is that what the gentleman is asserting?
