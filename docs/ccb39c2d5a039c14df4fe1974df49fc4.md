Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, last week, the new Congress adopted the most 
significant expansion of veterans health care in the history of the VA.

The real-life story of Lt. Sylvia Blackwood highlights why this is so 
important. Lt. Blackwood began suffering from PTSD after serving two 
tours of duty in Iraq. She found the strength to check herself into the 
VA Medical Center here in Washington. She was suicidal, but instead of 
receiving immediate treatment, she was directed to a waiting room. When 
she was finally admitted, she did not receive therapy or relief.

According to an in-depth series published by The Washington Post this 
week, unfortunately, Lt. Blackwood's story is not uncommon. An 
estimated one-third of all veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan 
suffer from mental health challenges.

America's servicemen and -women deserve the best care possible when 
they return from war, both for their physical and mental health. That 
is why this new Congress last week passed the most significant 
expansion and improvement in veterans health care in the VA's 77-year 
history. It's important for all Americans to take pride in that action.
