Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise to express grave 
concern for one of our soldiers being held in harm's way by the Taliban 
in Afghanistan. I join with Secretary Gates to call this disgusting. 
Knowing the brave men and women of the United States military, I know 
they will not leave one soldier behind. The 18th Congressional District 
has approximately the largest number of active duty soldiers returning 
from Iraq and Afghanistan. The numbers are large throughout the State 
of Texas. We have grave concern and are in sympathy with his family. We 
want them to know that we do care. We want them to know that as the 
soldiers are on the battlefield in Afghanistan, we will not stop until 
he is found.

It is necessary to express our belief that our soldiers are precious. 
We thank them for the sacrifice they make on behalf of our freedom and 
know that we will not leave one behind. It is disgusting, and the 
Taliban need to know we will never give up.
