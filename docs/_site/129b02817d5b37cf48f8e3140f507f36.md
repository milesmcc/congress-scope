Mr. MENENDEZ. Five days, Senator Byrd.

Cancer patients going through the dark winter of their illness are 
waiting on lifesaving treatments that only intensive scientific 
research can discover. Congress has a bill before it to fund that 
research, but President Bush vetoed the funding once, and his allies in 
Congress have whittled it down as much as they could. The cost of the 
funding increase for that cancer research, to turn the winter of their 
illness into the spring of possibility? It is $329 million, or less 
than 1 day in Iraq.
