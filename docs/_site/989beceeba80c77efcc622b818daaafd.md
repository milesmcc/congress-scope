# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `989beceeba80c77efcc622b818daaafd`
`Mr. SHADEGG â€” 14 February 2007`

---


Mr. SHADEGG. Pete Hegseth served in both Baghdad and Samarra for a 
year. He was an infantry platoon leader in Iraq. He fought both on the 
streets of Baghdad and Samarra, and here is what First Lieutenant Pete 
Hegseth said about the surge. He never heard the term ''surge,'' but he 
described the struggle he faced. He said, and I quote, ''America is 
fighting with a hand tied behind its back.'' ''We simply do not have 
enough troops in Iraq, and we need them now.'' That was last October.

Discussing his situation in Samarra, Lieutenant Hegseth went on. 
There in Samarra, he goes on to say, and I quote, ''We had just enough 
troops to control Samarra and secure ourselves, but not enough to bring 
lasting stability or security.''

He goes on and says, ''Two things are to blame for our predicament. 
The first reason is that we did not have enough troops in Samarra,'' 
and I quote ''the second, because of a lack of troops, American 
military leaders,'' those on the ground, those engaged in this fight, 
''are forced to make a choice between mission objectives and self-
preservation.'' He goes on to complain that all too often that choice 
that they are forced into is protection of our troops, not mission 
objectives.

Let me tell you how he concluded, because I think it is pertinent to 
this debate, where what we seek to do is to disapprove the surge of 
20,000 troops.

I believe that the safety of America depends on the outcome of the 
battle in the streets of Baghdad. Pete Hegseth


asks, and I quote, ''Why then do we have just enough troops in Iraq not 
to lose?''

To conclude, he says ''Americans understand a defeat in Iraq would 
have horrible consequences for America and its allies for decades to 
come. America has the capacity to win.'' He wrote, ''Why then are we 
pursuing a bare minimum approach?''

I urge my colleagues to vote against this dangerous and ill-advised 
resolution.
