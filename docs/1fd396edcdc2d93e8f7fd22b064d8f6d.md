# DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we don't have to use the 30 hours. We 
can start working on this tomorrow. There are amendments, as the 
Senator has indicated, members of the committee want to offer which 
relate to the bill. We should do that. Now, I hope we don't have to 
file cloture on the bill itself if we get on it. I think we should try 
to finish the Defense bill.

As I have indicated, I went to Afghanistan. We have learned a lot, 
and we are implementing what we learned in Iraq. There are some things 
in Iraq that didn't do so well. We are trying to do better in 
Afghanistan. But it takes resources, and that is what this bill is 
about. I hope we don't have to wait 30 hours. We don't have to do that.



We have a national election coming up. Speaking for the Republican 
leader, we don't want to be here until November 3, which is a Monday. 
We need to allow people to get back and work--those who want to help 
McCain and Obama, those who want to work on their own campaigns, and 
those who want to help others who are campaigning. I hope we can 
legislate on this tomorrow. Before we do that, we have to proceed to it 
tonight.
