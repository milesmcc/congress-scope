Mr. SPRATT. PAYGO is never applied to discretionary spending. It 
would be very difficult at this time to do it when every year we have 
an end run around discretionary budget with the President's 
supplementals for Iraq and Afghanistan. It would be very difficult to 
cap discretionary.

Your party, on its watch, allowed PAYGO discretionary spending caps, 
all of those constraints in 1990, to expire and did not renew them. The 
main reason you didn't was you knew if we had a double-edge PAYGO 
applicable to tax cuts as well as mandatory increases, you would be 
unable to pass additional tax cuts as part of your agenda.
