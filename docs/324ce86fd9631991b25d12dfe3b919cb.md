Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, despite the current focus on 
disagreements over funding for the International Monetary Fund and 
closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, the primary intent of 
the supplemental is to continue funding for the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. As Members who remain opposed to the bill, we need to make 
sure and make clear our opposition and work to defeat the bill.

It's notable that attempts to make important changes to the 
legislation, such as a call for an exit strategy from Afghanistan, or 
demands for increased transparency or accountability at the IMF, have 
been rebuffed. Continued funding of the war operations in Iraq ensures 
a continued occupation, thereby undermining the stated U.S. goal for 
withdrawal by the end of 2010. Funds for Iraq should be dedicated to 
bringing all of our troops home, and bringing those contractors home as 
well.

It's time to end this war. ''No'' to any more funds for the war in 
Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. And ''no'' if they try to put any 
other kind of legislation and tie it to the war funding.

Defeat the supplemental.
