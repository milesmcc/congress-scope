Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2929.

From the beginning of the President's invasion and occupation of 
Iraq, he has insisted that the United States has no intention of 
permanently occupying that country. I think there is no better way to 
reassure both our friends and our adversaries that the United States 
does not intend to become an imperial occupier of Iraq than to make 
clear that the U.S. will not build permanent military bases there.

The American people are seeking clear assurance that their government 
has a plan for leaving Iraq. If the President fails to embrace this 
legislation, it would only confirm for many Americans that the 
President has no strategy for bringing our troops home and, in fact, 
intends to keep them there forever.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I hope the President will 
listen to the American people and sign it into law.
