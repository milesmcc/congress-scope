Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I have had to listen as my colleagues on the 
opposite side of the aisle have made comments like, give our soldiers a 
chance.

This is not about our soldiers. This is about a failed policy. I 
think we need to go over some of the facts again, the facts that 70 
percent of Americans remember but my colleagues on the opposite side of 
the aisle seem to have forgotten.

Number one. There were no Iraqis on the plane that day.

Number two. There were no weapons of mass destruction.



They weren't there. They were never found.

Number three. There was no al Qaeda in Iraq before the war, so it 
doesn't matter if we reduce the number. There were none before the war.

Number four. This could have been a war against terrorists, should 
have been a war against terrorists, not a war against the Iraqis.

Now we have almost 4,000 dead Americans. We don't even know how many 
dead Iraqis. It's a terrible tragedy in our Nation. And we're making 
decisions to spend billions of dollars in Iraq while we tell our 
people, sorry, we don't have money for education. Sorry, we don't have 
money for health care. Sorry, we don't have money to build bridges.

Bring these troops home. And this is what we are doing responsibly. 
We're saying ''no'' to the President and ''yes'' to the American 
people.
