`Mr. SCOTT of Georgia â€” 13 March 2007`

Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Well, thank you, Mr. Salazar. You have done 
extraordinarily well in presenting the very crucible of our bill, which 
is bringing the accountability, bringing the needed transparency. No 
more, no place is it needed more so than in the care of our wounded 
soldiers.

And so much has fallen through the cracks. I read this report. I just 
want to, I will go back to it for a moment, Mr. Salazar, because it 
says this. It says that more than 25,000 service members have been 
wounded in the two wars, and nearly half seriously enough that they can 
not return to duty within 72 hours. The delays in the Army's rating of 
disability have been a source of deep frustration for many, with 
wounded soldiers waiting hours to be moved on, days, and sometimes 
months to be moved on with their lives outside the military. Many in 
the National Guard themselves have lost their jobs. We have yet to even 
come to the depths of the pain that our soldiers are faced with as a 
result of this.


So when the President says send 21,000 more in, send these in, he 
never again, this President will never again have to go before the 
voters. But you do and I do. And when we go back before them, they will 
know that we have done everything in our power to bring a right look on 
a wrong situation, and to correct this terrible, terrible imbalance for 
our veterans.

And so I thank you for your participation, and I thank you for 
highlighting that great need. I appreciate your passion for this. We 
are very, very, pleased for your presentation.

Madam Speaker, before I bring in another person, I want to make a 
point, because I think it is very important that we take a moment to 
address what the leadership of the Democratic Party in this House of 
Representatives is really talking about in our legislation. We had, 
prior to this, a truth squad, and you have people who are trying to 
make it this or make it that.

We realize, as Democrats, that we have an obligation to fulfill the 
desires and the wishes of the American people for a change in direction 
in Iraq, among other places, but definitely in Iraq. And it is not an 
easy thing to do. But it is, as I pointed out earlier, in our exclusive 
power to legislate and to appropriate and to provide the oversight. 
That is critical. And this is what we are proposing in our troop 
readiness, veterans, health, and Iraq accountability act. This is what 
the talk is about.

Let me just, point by point, go through the points so we understand. 
As the war in Iraq enters its fifth year, with no end in sight, that is 
fundamentally the most worrisome thing on the minds of the American 
people. This has gone on longer than World War II. There has never been 
the clear mission, beyond go and find if they have got weapons of mass 
destruction. When the soldiers went and they determined that they 
didn't, that should have ended it. There was no authorization to go in 
and remove a regime. There were no Iraqis that marched on the Capitol 
in Washington and said bring us a democracy. Democracy is hard. It 
requires people to want it in their gut. We are dealing with a society 
and a region in the Middle East where these civil wars have been going 
on, in some shape or form, since Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and 
Sarah and Hagar, Ishmael, Esau, the prophet Mohammed and his son-in-
law, which brought about the split of the Sunnis and the Shias. 
Thousands of years, that is what this is.

Our children have no business losing their lives in this war. The 
President has asked that money continue to be provided with no strings 
attached. The American people want some strings attached. The reason is 
because as we just got through doing, with what is happening at Walter 
Reed, with what is happening to our veterans, with the fact of no body 
armor. We are not going without being rested and properly equipped, 
well after the American people have called for a new direction. That 
set the stage for what we are going to offer in this bill.

And I want to come back to that, and I want to pause for a moment 
because we do have another one of our distinguished Members with us, 
and he has been working very hard as a member of the Blue Dogs and has 
also been working very hard in this area of bringing transparency and 
accountability to the situation in Iraq and responding to the needs of 
the American people. And I want to recognize for as much time as he may 
need, Congressman Mahoney of Florida.
