`Mr. POE of Texas â€” 21 May 2009`

---


Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, it's been solemnly said that ''the 
story of America's quest for freedom is inscribed on her history in the 
blood of her patriots.'' Those comments were made by Randy Vader.

America was born of war and has always had to fight to keep liberty's 
light shining very bright.

Monday is Memorial Day. We honor those of the military family who 
went somewhere in the world, fighting for America's ideals and 
protecting the rest of us, but did not return home. Their blood has 
stained and sanctified the lands of Europe, the Middle East, Asia, the 
Pacific Islands, the soil of America and places known only by God.

One of those warriors was Frank Luke. Madam Speaker, you may have 
never heard of him, but he is just one of the 4.4 million doughboys 
that went over there in World War I. He's an example of the young, 
tenacious American warrior.

This is a photograph of him taken shortly before his death in 1918. 
In World War I, in September of 1918, in just 9 days of combat flying, 
10 missions, and only 30 hours of flight time, Second Lieutenant Frank 
Luke shot down 18 enemy aircraft. Let me repeat. Eighteen enemy 
aircraft.

On his last patrol, though pursued by eight German planes, without 
hesitation he attacked and shot down in flames three German aircraft, 
being himself under heavy fire from ground batteries and hostile 
planes. Severely wounded, he descended within 50 meters of the ground 
and, flying at this low altitude in France, opened fire on enemy 
troops, killing six and wounding many more. Forced to make a landing, 
and surrounded on all sides by the enemy, he drew his automatic pistol, 
defended himself gallantly until he fell dead with a wound in the 
chest.

Frank Luke was 20 years of age. He had been in Europe less than 30 
days. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor, and he was the first 
aviator in United States history to win the Congressional Medal of 
Honor. He was one of the 116,000 doughboys who died in the War to End 
All Wars that did not return home.

Author Blaine Pardoe referred to him as the ''terror of the autumn 
skies.''

That was 90 years ago. It has always been the young that give their 
youth so we can have a future. And we should always remember every one 
of them, every one that died in all of America's wars.

Now we are engaged in a war in the valley of the sun and the deserts 
of the gun, in Iraq, and the rugged, cruel, rough mountains of 
Afghanistan.

My congressional district area of southeast Texas has lost 26 
warriors since I have been in Congress. Here they are, Madam Speaker. 
You notice they represent a cross section of the United States. They 
are all races. They're of both sexes. They are of all ages, and they're 
from all branches of the service. They're from big cities like Houston, 
Texas, and small towns like Hull, Sabine Pass, Beach City, Humble, 
Groves; yet, they're all American warriors who gave their lives in 
combat for the United States.

I will place the names and backgrounds of these 26 from the Second 
Congressional District of Texas who have been killed in Iraq into the 
Congressional Record.

It has been said that ''wars may be fought by weapons, but they are 
won by warriors. It is the spirit of the men who follow and the man who 
leads that gains the victory.'' That was said by General George S. 
Patton, Jr. near the end of World War II.

These noble 26 are just some of the 4,962 that have been killed in 
the line of duty taking care of America in America's current wars in 
the Middle East.

Madam Speaker, this is a photograph of the cliffs of Normandy. This 
is in Normandy, France, where 9,347 Americans are buried, most of them 
young kids. They liberated and saved France and the rest of Europe in 
the great World War II. They never came home. The guns have long since 
been silent on Normandy's shores, but the sands are still stained with 
the blood of the fallen soldiers.

On the 40th anniversary of D-day, on June 6, 1984, President Ronald 
Reagan stood at this cemetery and said ''We will always remember. We 
will always be proud. We will always be prepared so we may always be 
free.''

So, Madam Speaker, when the sun comes up Monday morning, we should 
fly the Flag, stand outside, look to the heavens and thank those who 
took care of America in the long, lamentable dark night of the hour of 
war.

And that's just the way it is.
