`Mrs. FEINSTEIN â€” 18 June 2008`

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank you very much.

I particularly salute the Senator from Maryland. I thank her for her 
leadership of our group of Democratic women. Senator Mikulski has, from 
the get-go, been there for the women of the Senate. This is the second 
time I have participated in this Checklist for Change, which she has 
put together.

I also salute Senator McCaskill, who was on the floor, who has 
brought a very talented dimension to our group of women.

I think, as the other Democratic women as well come to the floor to 
discuss this Checklist for Change, you are going to see one thing; and 
that one thing is, we are all very committed to this country and very 
committed to see this country do the right thing by her people.

So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I participate in this 
effort. I thank both of them and the women who will come after me 
speaking as well.

My comments are forged by 15 years on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
With the exception of Senator Moseley-Braun for a short period of time, 
I am the only woman who has served in history on the Judiciary 
Committee of the Senate and also serving 7 years as a member of the 
Intelligence Committee.

I have always taken great stock in the fact that the United States of 
America has been a beacon of hope because people all over the world 
look to American justice and American human rights for inspiration.

We have represented not only a brighter future for people, but we 
have represented a government of law, a government under the 
Constitution, a government by the people, for the people, with justice 
for all--not just for a certain few but all.

Now that beacon has been dimmed. Despite President Bush's promise 
that the United States would fight the war on terror consistent with 
American values and ''in the finest traditions of valor,'' the decision 
was made, as Vice President Cheney said in 2001, to ''go to the dark 
side.''

Indeed, this administration has put our Nation on the wrong track in 
so many ways, including: creating a prisoner of war detention facility 
at Guantanamo Bay with a separate, lesser system of justice--now 
repudiated by the Supreme Court; authorizing interrogation techniques 
that constitute torture; reopening the nuclear door by seeking to 
develop low-yield battlefield nuclear weapons and 100-kiloton nuclear 
bunker busters; countenancing, for the first time, the use of nuclear 
weapons as a first strike against a nonnuclear threat, if chemical or 
biological weapons were threatened--not used but threatened--against 
the United States; preemptively invading Iraq, under the guise of 
weapons of mass destruction and a false nexus to al-Qaida.

So, today, we see America's credibility in the world diminished, and 
the administration's policies have become a recruiting tool for our 
enemies. So, in 7/1/2/ years, this great country has gone from a nation 
embraced to a nation often tarnished.

Yes, the time has come for a change. The time has come to: lay out an 
exit strategy in Iraq so we can begin to bring our people home; close 
Guantanamo, shut it down. The Secretary of Defense says shut it down. 
The former Secretary of State says shut it down. Governor Kean, 
Congressman Hamilton, a litany of four-star officers and flag officers 
have said shut it down. It does not become America's values.

The time has come to stop America's use of torture; establish a 
uniform standard for detentions and interrogations across our 
Government. This is part of the Senate's Intelligence authorization 
bill, and it will remain part of this bill. That bill essentially says 
all elements of the American Government will utilize the Army Field 
Manual and the procedures therein, both the prohibitions on eight 
specific items of torture as well as specific techniques to move ahead.

The time has come to use robust diplomacy; create coalitions; listen 
to allies; talk with adversaries. This makes us stronger, not weaker.

The time has come to develop a new, sensible nuclear weapons policy, 
so we do not encourage the very kind of proliferation we seek to 
prevent.



Yes, the time has come for change. The time has come to restore 
America's credibility as a moral and just nation, dedicated to liberty 
and justice.

We are the greatest military and economic power the world has ever 
seen. Our global influence is unmatched. For the past half century, our 
country has embraced international cooperation, not out of 
vulnerability or weakness but from a position of strength.
