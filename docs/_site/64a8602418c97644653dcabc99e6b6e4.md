Mr. AKIN. Yes. Reclaiming my time, you could also look at it from 
this point of view, which would be that the interest we pay on that 
amount of money in this porkulous bill would buy nine new aircraft 
carriers every year, just the interest on that money, or you could look 
at it another way. You could say all we've been hearing about is how 
expensive the war in Iraq is. Well, add up every day of the war in 
Iraq. Add it all together. We're talking way more money in the first 5 
weeks than what we spend in Iraq. In the House version, you've put Iraq 
and Afghanistan together, and it's still more money. So this is a 
pretty good chunk of change.

What you're saying, gentlemen, is that a lot of that had nothing to 
do with jobs. It was just putting more money into government programs. 
So the chart that you show there didn't really show an 8 percent 
increase. What it really showed was way up there. What did you say? 
I'll yield. What was the actual number when you added it up?
