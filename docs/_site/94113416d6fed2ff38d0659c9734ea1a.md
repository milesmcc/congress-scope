Mr. PALLONE. I appreciate it, and I know you want to get back to the 
Iraq war, as I think you should. I want to thank you again, and just 
say in conclusion from my part of this tonight, what I really don't 
like is trying to make this into an ideological debate.

When I hear my colleagues on the Republican side, instead of being 
practical and looking at what is going to accomplish something, to 
start making it ideological and talk about entitlements and socialism 
and the whole thing, we don't need that. We don't need that rhetoric 
here. We as Democrats are trying to accomplish things in a practical 
way, without ideology, without right or left and all this jargon that 
we are hearing from the other side.

I just hope that it doesn't continue, because otherwise I am going to 
come down here every night and talk about why practically speaking the 
children's health initiative is a good program.
