Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, welcome back to 
Washington. Most of us were home in our districts over the August 
district work period and heard from our constituents and heard from 
many others.

Clearly, as we get into the fall, there are a lot of very important 
issues that Congress is going to deal with. On the issue of what 
happens to Iraq, I would hope my colleagues would wait and listen to 
what General Petraeus and Admiral Crocker would have to say before we 
make up our minds and outline our strategy for where we are going to 
go.

Secondly, the issue of spending and taxes is clearly going to be 
coming up in October, and I would urge all of my colleagues to take a 
real serious look at just how much of the American taxpayer's wallet we 
are willing to get into and how much we really need to spend.

There are a host of other issues that we are going to deal with this 
fall, and I would have one more request of all of my colleagues: let's 
listen to what the American people had to say over the August recess. 
Let's find a way to reach our hands across the aisle and work in an 
honest way together to deal with what the American people expect of us, 
and that is to deal with the issues that face our country and to do it 
in a bipartisan way.
