Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to bring the Duncan Hunter National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 to the floor today for 
approval by the House.

This bill represents a final agreement reached with the Senate, and I 
believe it can pass the Senate, which is critical, of course. The 
troops and their families need these authorities by September 30.

It's important to note this agreement was reached in a very short 
period of time. While the House finished its work back in May, the 
Senate approved its version of the bill just one week ago today.

The two Armed Services Committees have been working overtime ever 
since, and as a result we have not been able to provide all of the 
notice and time for examination of the bill that we normally would. I 
regret that fact. But I can assure the House that we observed all of 
the long-standing traditions of fairness and bipartisanship this 
committee is known for.

My good friend, Duncan Hunter, and his team of members and his staff 
have been involved in every step of this process, and we have also 
worked hard to consult with the outside committees on the issues that 
are within their jurisdiction. We also placed the completed bill and 
report language on our Web site as soon as it was done last evening.

This is a good bill. It authorizes $531.4 billion for the Department 
of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of 
Energy. It also authorizes $68.6 billion to support ongoing military 
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan during fiscal year


2009, a similar amount to that which passed the House in May.

To restore readiness, this agreement provides $8.6 billion for the 
Army and $1.8 billion for the Marine Corps to repair and replace 
equipment. This agreement also provides $800 million for National Guard 
and Reserve equipment. To help manage demands placed on our 
servicemembers by our military obligations, the agreement increases the 
size of the military by 7,000 soldiers, 5,000 marines, over 1,000 
sailors and 450 airmen.

To improve the quality of life for our forces and their families, the 
agreement provides a 3.9 percent pay raise for the troops, which is .5 
percent more than the President's budget request. The agreement also 
preserves important health care benefits by prohibiting fee increases 
in TRICARE and the TRICARE pharmacy program and creating new preventive 
health care initiatives to improve the readiness of our force.

Finally, I would like to say a word about the person for whom this 
bill is named, as well as for others who helped us get the bill done 
under an extraordinary time frame. Duncan Hunter has been a tireless 
advocate for the troops and a great partner, as well as a personal 
friend to me. The Armed Services Committee will miss him. I think it's 
deeply appropriate that we name this bill for him.

I also want to thank all the members of the Armed Services Committee, 
particularly the subcommittee chairmen and the ranking members. 
Finally, I wish to thank the bipartisan staff, fantastic staff, they 
couldn't be better. Our committee has been blessed with such a staff, 
and they have worked tirelessly to help get this bill negotiated and 
completed. It is an excellent bill. It's urgently needed by our 
military, and I urge my colleagues in the House, as well as in the 
Senate, to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2009, which is named for and in honor of Duncan Hunter, the 
ranking member, former chairman of this committee.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
