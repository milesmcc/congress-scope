Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, this is supposed to be a war supplemental bill, 
but there is so much nonwar spending in this bill. For example, one 
portion of the bill dumps millions of dollars in Liberia. The last I 
saw, Liberia is not even on the same continent as Iraq. And why does 
this bill have anything to do with funding Liberia and their needs?

But more importantly, this bill puts our troops at risk, because it 
sows the cloud of defeatism and cynicism that seems to be predominant 
in Washington, D.C.

Congresses before us have tried to run the war, even as far back as 
the Continental Congress. They were so upset with George Washington, 
they wanted to get rid of the Commander in Chief and replace him with 
somebody else. His comments to the Continental Congress then are worth 
noting today. He said, ''We should never despair. Our situation before 
has been unpromising and has changed for the better. So it will 
again.''

And that is what we must do. Support our troops. Give them the troops 
that they need to finish the mission that we have asked them to 
accomplish on behalf of national security.
