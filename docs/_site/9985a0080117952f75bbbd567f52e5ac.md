Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his insight as 
someone who has served in the war in Iraq as a captain in the Army, and 
we appreciate his service here in the Congress and his insight into 
helping us draft proposals like H.R. 97 to restore accountability and 
common sense on how your tax money is being spent in Iraq and ensuring 
that it is directed towards our brave men and woman in uniform and 
protecting them and keeping them safe.

Mr. Speaker, it is time for a new direction in Iraq, and that is what 
this Blue Dog hour has been about this evening. I thank my colleagues 
who have joined me.

If you have any comments or questions, you can e-mail us at 
BlueDog@mail.house.gov. That is BlueDog@mail.house.gov. We stand here 
on behalf of 47 fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog members that 
make up the Blue Dog Coalition.
