Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the SCHIP 
program. President Bush's veto on SCHIP has abandoned at least 24,000 
children in my District alone. President Bush claims we want 
''gimmicks'' and ''funding schemes''--we don't want gimmicks we want 
insurance for 8.7 million uninsured children. Children like Kristofer 
and Felecity Famutimi from San Bernardino County, whose hospital care 
for sickle cell anemia crippled the family financially. Their mom, Ola 
had to quit her job to take care of them. SCHIP is the only reason they 
have pulled through.

President Bush claims that Democrats are ''putting health coverage 
for poor children at risk--to gain political points''. I am not voting 
for politics, I am voting for the 33,000 children in my District who 
are currently uninsured. Covering 800,000 children costs the same as 1 
week of the war in Iraq. It is time America gets her priorities in 
order. I urge my colleagues to secure the futures of our Nations' 
poorest children by voting to override the President's veto.
