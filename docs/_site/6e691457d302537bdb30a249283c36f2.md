`Mr. CASTLE â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Ohio for 
yielding and for his work on this legislation.

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3087, legislation 
requiring the administration to work closely with Congress and our 
military leaders in communicating a comprehensive post-surge strategy 
for Iraq.

Since 2003, over 3,800 American military personnel have been killed 
in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and more than 27,000 have been injured. 
These are very difficult times, and it is our duty to do everything 
possible to support those who have risked so much in service to their 
Nation.

To this point, however, the U.S. Congress has been consumed by 
partisan infighting, which has resulted in gridlock and has prevented 
debate on substantive proposals like the Iraq Study Group 
Recommendations Implementation Act.

The American people deserve a straightforward understanding of our 
involvement and long-term objectives in the Middle East. The 
legislation before us today, of which I am a proud cosponsor, takes an 
important step forward by requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit 
regular reports to Congress regarding the status of post-surge 
planning.

Clearly, the U.S. Congress should not be acting without considering 
the advice of our military commanders in Iraq, and this legislation 
will ensure that Secretary Gates, General Petraeus and other senior 
officials are capable of communicating developments with Members of 
Congress and the administration.

This information will also provide a greater understanding of 
progress made on General Petraeus' proposal for the redeployment of 
U.S. troops, and it will assist Congress in budgeting for the possible 
missions that may continue in Iraq, such as efforts to disrupt 
terrorist organizations and train Iraqi security forces.

H.R. 3087 is the first of what I hope will be a substantive, 
bipartisan effort in Congress to work with our military and foreign 
policy leaders to achieve stability in Iraq and bring our soldiers home 
to their families.

Last week, 14 Democrats and 14 Republicans endorsed such an approach 
by signing the Bipartisan Compact on Iraq Debate. Like Mr. Tanner's 
proposal, the importance of developing a clearly defined and measurable 
mission in Iraq is one of eight central principles agreed to in the 
Bipartisan Compact.

Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that by finally agreeing to consider H.R. 
3087, Members from both parties will signal a willingness to set aside 
the partisan tactics that have crippled our efforts over the last 
several months.

The Iraq war provokes intense and genuine feelings from individuals 
at all points of the political spectrum. However, politics as usual in 
Washington, D.C. should not be allowed to consume our efforts in lieu 
of progress.

Bridging this critical political divide in Washington is our only 
hope for transitioning responsibility to the Iraqi Government and 
bringing about real substantive change in Iraq.

Let us all join together to support H.R. 3087.
