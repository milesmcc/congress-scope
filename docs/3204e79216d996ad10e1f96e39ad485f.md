Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior 
Senator from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee, in support of amendment No. 680. The 
substance of this amendment is what the Senate passed by a 94-to-3 vote 
as the minimum wage and small business tax bill on February 1.

This amendment would thus extend to hard-working Americans a long-
overdue increase in the minimum wage. It is long past time when 
Congress should have increased the minimum wage.

Now some worry that an increase in the minimum wage would burden 
small


businesses. Smaller businesses employ a disproportionate share of 
workers earning the minimum wage.

Representatives of small businesses have therefore argued that any 
increase in the minimum wage should be accompanied by tax incentives 
targeted for small businesses in order to lower their costs.

Small business is particularly important in rural States like 
Montana. Rural communities generally do not have large employers. Rural 
families rely on small businesses for jobs.

The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over taxes. The committee held 
a hearing on January 10 entitled ''Tax Incentives for Businesses in 
Response to a Minimum Wage Increase.'' The committee heard from a 
variety of witnesses, including labor economists, small business 
owners, and tax experts.

Following that hearing, the committee held a markup on January 17. 
The committee reported an original bill called the Small Business and 
Work Opportunity Act of 2007.

That bill is a revenue-neutral bill containing a number of tax 
incentives for small businesses and businesses that hire minimum wage 
workers. The committee favorably reported the bill by unanimous voice 
vote. And the majority leader included that bill in its entirety in his 
amendment to the House-passed Fair Minimum Wage Act. That bill passed 
the Senate on February 1.

Now the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions 
Committee and I have included that bill in its entirety in our 
amendment to the House-passed supplemental appropriations bill, the 
U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act.

The small business tax provisions included in this amendment will 
help small businesses to succeed. These provisions will spur investment 
and thus create jobs. They will provide greater opportunity for workers 
looking for a job. They all enjoy strong support.

To carry out day-to-day activities, small business owners are often 
required to invest significant amounts of money in depreciable 
property, such as machinery. The amendment would help business owners 
to afford these large purchases for their businesses. To do so, the 
amendment would extend for another year expensing under section 179 of 
the Internal Revenue Code.

New equipment and property are necessary to successfully operate a 
business. But large business purchases generally require depreciation 
across a number of years, and depreciation requires additional 
bookkeeping.

Expensing under section 179 allows for an immediate 100-percent 
deduction of the cost for most personal property purchased for use in a 
business. In 2007, small business owners may deduct up to $112,000 of 
equipment expenses.

When small business owners are able to expense equipment, they no 
longer have to keep depreciation records on that equipment. So 
extending section 179 expensing would ease small business bookkeeping 
burdens.

The amendment would also allow small business owners to quickly 
recover the cost of improvements to their establishments through 
extension and expansion of the 15-year straight-line depreciation 
period for leaseholds and restaurant improvements. Without this 
provision, they would have to depreciate over the course of 39 years.

Allowing retailers and restaurants to use a 15-year straight-line 
depreciation period would help entrepreneurs who open a business or 
remodel their property. The entrepreneur's investment could be 
recovered over a period of time more closely reflecting wear and tear.

The amendment would extend the 15-year recovery period for leasehold 
and restaurant improvements. The amendment would also broaden the 
provision to allow retail owners and new restaurants to take advantage 
of this shortened depreciation period.

The amendment would also help businesses to provide jobs for workers 
who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce by extending 
and expanding the work opportunity tax credit or WOTC.

WOTC encourages businesses to hire workers who might not otherwise 
find work. WOTC has been remarkably successful. By reducing 
expenditures on public assistance, WOTC is highly cost-effective. The 
business community is highly supportive of these credits. Industries 
like retail and restaurants that hire many low-skill workers find it 
especially useful.

The amendment would extend WOTC for 5 years, and the amendment would 
expand the credit to make it available to employers who hire veterans 
disabled after 9/11.

As of July 2006, nearly 20,000 members of our Armed Forces were 
wounded in action in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
Freedom. Many of these soldiers are now permanently disabled. Many do 
not know what they are going to do. We need to help these young men and 
women. A modest tax incentive to help them get back into the workforce 
is one place to start.

The amendment would simplify the way that small businesses keep 
records for tax purposes. The cash method of accounting is often the 
easiest method of accounting. Allowing small business to use the cash 
method reduces the administrative and tax compliance burden of these 
businesses.

The amendment would let more businesses take advantage of this 
method. Businesses with gross receipts up to $10 million would be able 
to use the cash method.

The amendment helps small businesses by modifying S corporation 
rules. These modifications reduce the effect of what some call the 
''sting tax.'' These modifications improve the viability of community 
banks.

Senator Grassley, members of the Finance Committee, and I have worked 
to develop a balanced package, and I believe that we have succeeded.

The language included in the amendment is a responsible package that 
will ensure the continued growth and success of small businesses.

We have also paid for it. Most of the offsets are proposals that the 
Senate has supported several times before.

The offsets include a proposal to end future tax benefits for abusive 
sale in/lease out tax shelters, or SILOs. These deals use foreign tax 
exempt entities to generate sham tax deductions. Even after Congress 
shut these deals down in 2004, some taxpayers continue to take 
excessive, unwarranted depreciation deductions on German sewer systems 
and the like. The IRS says that it has 1,500 of these deals under 
audit, involving billions, yes, billions, of dollars.

The offsets include doubling fines, penalties, and interest on taxes 
owed as a result of using certain abusive offshore financial 
arrangements to avoid paying taxes. Taxpayers who hide their money from 
the IRS through offshore credit cards and other shady financial 
arrangements need to get the message that this Congress is serious 
about ending these abuses.

The offsets include closing corporate loopholes for companies who 
reinvented themselves as foreign corporations to avoid paying tax here 
in America. In March of 2002, Senator Grassley and I made it clear that 
those who put profits ahead of patriotism did so at their own peril. 
The amendment would treat those who moved offshore after that date like 
a U.S. company, and the amendment would make those companies pay U.S. 
taxes.

The hard-working American taxpayers whom we are trying to help in 
this amendment should not have to pay more in taxes because some 
taxpayers are abusing the tax system through tax shelters. They also 
should not have to bear the burden of civil settlements and punitive 
damages paid by companies who engage in questionable behavior.

These are sound tax policy changes. Let us finally enact an increase 
in the minimum wage, and let us also pass this useful package of tax 
benefits to help America's small businesses. I urge my colleagues to 
support the amendment.
