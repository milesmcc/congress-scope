Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, I submit for the Congressional 
Record a thoughtful comparison of U.S. military strategy in Vietnam and 
present-day military operations in Iraq written by Jerry Hogan, a 
retired Army Lieutenant Colonel who lives in Heath, TX, in the Fourth 
Congressional District. I urge my colleagues to review and reflect upon 
this as Congress faces critical decisions in the upcoming months on 
funding the war on terror.









 Comparison and History Teach us a Lot















(By Jerry Hogan)




 Sometimes it is important that we look at what we have done 


 in the past to make sure we don't make the same mistakes 


 again.



 In 1950, believe it or not, the United States established a 


 military assistance and advisory group in Vietnam to advise 


 the French puppet government on strategy and train Vietnamese 


 soldiers. This started America's longest war that did not end 


 until April of 1975 with the infamous ''Fall of Saigon'' that 


 we saw in our living rooms thanks to the modern miracle of 


 television. For the almost three million of us who served in 


 that war, those pictures on our TV sets burned holes through 


 our heads as we saw first hand what we had done to a country 


 and its people as we abandoned them without finishing the job 


 we helped start.



 Unfortunately there are many similarities between the U.S. 


 involvement in Vietnam and our current involvement in Iraq. 


 While we had advisors in Vietnam starting in 1950, our real 


 combat role that saw the buildup of our forces go from 16,000 


 to 553,000, did not start until after the Gulf of Tonkin 


 incident where, on August 2, 1964, one of our Naval ships was 


 attacked by torpedo boats along North Vietnam's coast. Two 


 days later, another ''attack'' occurred in about the same 


 place against two more of our ships. These ''attacks'' led to 


 retaliatory air strikes on our part and caused Congress to 


 approve the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which gave the 


 president power to conduct military operations in Southeast 


 Asia without declaring war. Later it was determined that the 


 second ''attack'' was questionable which caused many people 


 to say we entered this conflict under false pretenses. Sound 


 anything like how we got into Iraq according to the opponents 


 of that war?



 The Vietnam War is viewed by many historians as a Cold War 


 conflict between the United States, its allies, and the 


 Republic of Vietnam on one side, and the Soviet Union, its 


 allies, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic 


 Republic of Vietnam on the other. Many others, particularly 


 the vocal opponents to the U.S. involvement in this war, 


 viewed the conflict as a civil war between communist and non 


 communist Vietnamese factions.



 Today, the War in Iraq is viewed as a battleground between 


 the US, its allies, and the Republic of Iraq versus the 


 Islamist Jihadis and their allies, Syria and Iran, in 


 the International War on Terrorism. Exchange the words 


 ''communist and non communist'' with ''Sunni and Shiite'' 


 and you hear the same arguments today about this war being 


 just a civil war between two opposing religious factions 


 in Iraq. Isn't it amazing how history seems to repeat 


 itself with us Americans?



 While actual U.S. combat operations did not start in 


 Vietnam until 1964, U.S. forces assumed full responsibility 


 for training the South Vietnamese Army in 1956 and President 


 Kennedy increased our troop strength from 500 to over 16,000 


 when he took office. In his inaugural address, he made that 


 famous pledge we know so well: ''the U.S. will pay any price, 


 bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, 


 oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success 


 of liberty.'' Remember what President Bush continues to say 


 about our support for Afghanistan and Iraq as they held their 


 elections and voted for a democratic form of government and 


 how we would stand with them in their desire for a free and 


 elected democracy? Sounds like two of our presidents so 


 heavily involved with two separate unpopular wars had the 


 same views!



 During the Vietnam War, the U.S. had a Draft for supplying 


 personnel needed in the military. President Johnson refused 


 to mobilize the Reserve units during the war as he feared a 


 political backlash. This led to larger draft call ups and the 


 extension of some tours of duty. It also put a heavy strain 


 on U.S. forces committed to other parts of the world. While 


 the military today is an all-volunteer force, the same 


 problems face the services today; tour extensions in Iraq for 


 the Soldiers and Marines, equipment shortages, limited 


 capabilities in other areas of the world, repeated tours of 


 duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, and continued pressure on 


 families of the service men and women. Again, you might think 


 we learned from previous mistakes.



 In January of 1968, the forces of North Vietnam launched 


 the surprise ''Tet Offensive'' in hopes of sparking a 


 national uprising. While the military objectives were not 


 achieved, the U.S. public was shocked and confused over the 


 war as General Westmoreland, the commander in Vietnam, had 


 just predicted ''the end comes into view.'' The American 


 media, which had been largely supportive of the 


 administration, turned on President Johnson for what had 


 become an increasing credibility gap. His approval ratings 


 dropped from 48% to 36%; he declined to run for re-election; 


 and the public's support for the war started a rapid decline. 


 Any of this sound like something you may have heard recently?



 In December, 1974, the Congress passed the Foreign 


 Assistance Act of 1974, which cut off all military funding to 


 the South Vietnamese government. The act went on to restrict 


 the number of U.S. military personnel allowed in Vietnam to 


 ''no more than 4000 within six months of enactment and 3000 


 within one year.'' By April of 1975 only four months after 


 the cutoff of funds and the removal of essentially all U.S. 


 forces, the Republic of Vietnam fell to the victors from the 


 North.



 During the Vietnam War, over 250,000 South Vietnamese 


 military were killed and about 1.2 million were wounded. It 


 is estimated that somewhere between two and five million 


 Vietnamese civilians were killed. 58,000 Americans lost their 


 life while 153,000 were wounded. In Iraq today, about 3,500 


 Americans have been killed and about 18,000 have been 


 wounded. Close to 350 U.S. personnel have been killed in 


 Afghanistan. Statistics on Iraqi and Afghanistan's 


 military and civilian casualties are not available but 


 estimates show they are high as well.



 So what does this all mean today? Clearly there are two 


 opposing views as to what should happen in Iraq. The 


 President has been consistent in his view that we are 


 fighting an International War on Terrorism and that freedom 


 and democracy need help in the Middle East. Iraq is a 


 fledgling democracy trying to establish itself after decades 


 of dictatorship and after being made a main battleground by 


 the worldwide Jihadist forces. Strong religious and political 


 forces, both within and outside Iraq, are making the process 


 of democracy very difficult. A military solution will not 


 solve the problems in Iraq; it must be a political solution 


 with a military component. Political will, as much as 


 military might, is a decisive factor in this outcome.



 The second view being expressed daily by some of our 


 elected officials in Washington calls for a timetable for 


 withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. In my considered 


 military view, this outlandish stupid course of action takes 


 us right back to the days of Vietnam and is nothing more than 


 a political proposal that leads us once again to watching the 


 ''Fall of Saigon'' in our living rooms, but this time it will 


 be the ''Fall of Baghdad.'' I really don't want to go through 


 that again . . . and I hope you don't either. Let your 


 elected officials know how you feel.
