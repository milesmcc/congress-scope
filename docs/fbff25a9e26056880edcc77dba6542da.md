# DEMOCRATS' PLAN DOESN'T CUT IT

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the supplemental bill we 
are set to consider today only partially funds our troops. This leaves 
the possibility that Democratic leaders will again seek to undercut the 
efforts of General Petraeus before August. The plan is equivalent of an 
oil change when the car needs new tires.

President Bush pledged yesterday to veto the new Democrat funding 
bill. The President's veto supports our troops to complete the mission. 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has made clear the impact on the 
military of partial funding. He has said, ''In essence, the bill asks 
me to run the Department of Defense like a skiff, and I'm trying to 
drive the biggest supertanker in the world.''

Following their failed attempt to micromanage our military leaders 
and hamstring our troops in the battlefield, I am saddened that many 
Democrats are not facing up to the threats to our security. Al Qaeda 
spokesman Zawahiri has declared Iraq the central front in the global 
war on terrorism.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
