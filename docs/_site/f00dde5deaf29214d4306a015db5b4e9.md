`Mr. REID â€” 8 September 2008`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did not dream up the idea that projects 
were going to be terminated. That is what the Secretary of 
Transportation told me. Now, maybe I misunderstood her. Maybe she was 
exaggerating. But that is what I took away from my conversation with 
her.

It is difficult for me to argue with the Senator from New Hampshire 
because I think it is fair to say that he has been trying to raise a 
red flag for a number of years about the wild spending of this 
administration. Even though he is a stalwart Republican and close to 
the administration, he has not been quiet about this.

Now, this is an issue I brought up today because I was asked to do so 
by the White House. Let the record be clear: Democrats have been very 
supportive of funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We want to 
support the troops. And we can go into another discussion--and none of 
us want to get into that tonight--about what is going on in Afghanistan 
and Iraq.

But the highway trust fund, part of it--and I believe, if we ever get 
to a point where we are debating amendments on taking money out of mass 
transit--maybe 20, 25 years ago, when Nevada didn't have these 
tremendously difficult problems we have with traffic, with roads, and 
we were not concerned about mass transit, maybe we would have joined 
with the Senator from New Hampshire. But we in Nevada, as with many 
metropolitan areas around the country, are desperately in need of more 
transit money, not less--more transit money rather than less. So it 
would exacerbate a tremendously difficult problem if the idea of the 
Senator from New Hampshire bore fruit; that is, we take the money out 
of mass transit and put it in for highways. That would be the wrong 
thing to do.

You can no longer say that the highway trust fund is just for 
highways because for decades now, we have used part of this money--
rightfully so--because of actions of the Congress, along with the 
administrations, taking this money and doing very important mass-
transit projects.

So here is where we are. If we were able to have a vote on this piece 
of legislation tonight or tomorrow, it would pass overwhelmingly. But, 
as with the Senate, we cannot move to things just because we want to. 
We have a lot ahead of this. We have the Defense authorization bill, we 
have an energy issue we have to take up. That is next week. Every day 
that goes by, according to the Secretary of Transportation, is a bad 
day for the Department of Transportation.
