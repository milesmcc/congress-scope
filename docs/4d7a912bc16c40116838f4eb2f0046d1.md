Mrs. TAUSCHER. If the gentleman will yield, I just wanted to respond, 
since you were so nice to quote me.

Mr. Speaker, the truth is, as we all know, the Iraq Study Group had a 
very comprehensive strategy, but it was a radical departure from what 
the President is proposing today in this surge. I think there was some, 
you know, 70-plus recommendations in the Iraq Study Group, including 
shifting the mission to training of the Iraqi Security Forces and a big 
emphasis on diplomacy. So I don't think it is fair for the gentleman to 
cherry-pick a paragraph out of what the Iraq Study Group says.

But with all due respect, I will tell you what the Iraq Study Group 
recommended is not what the President is doing now. Frankly, the 
President has rejected the Iraq Study Group recommendations, and I 
think that to suggest that he is going along with the Iraq Study Group 
recommendations is really not correct.
