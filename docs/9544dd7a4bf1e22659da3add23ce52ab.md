Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, Louis Griese served with honor, with 
courage and skill; and last week on October 31, he lost his life while 
serving his third tour of duty in Iraq.

Please join me in honoring his memory. He leaves behind a wife, 
Stephany, and 4-month-old daughter, Skylar.

Sergeant Louis Griese of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, was killed as a 
result of wounds incurred from a roadside bomb. His family believes in 
service to one's Nation. A true believer in service, Sergeant Griese 
followed in the footsteps of his father who fought in the Korean War.

Sergeant Griese's mother, Susan Frihart, described her son, saying, 
''He


was very proud to be a soldier. He didn't want to leave his newborn 
baby, but he left because that was his duty.''

Every Member of Congress and every American owes a debt of gratitude 
to Louis Griese and his family for his dedicated and honorable service. 
Sergeant Griese made the ultimate sacrifice, and his service shall not 
be forgotten.

I ask all of you to join me in a moment of silence on his behalf.
