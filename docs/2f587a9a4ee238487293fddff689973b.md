Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and honor our military forces who have fought valiantly to 
strengthen our counterterrorism strategy. My top priority as chairwoman 
of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Terrorism, Unconventional 
Threats, and Capabilities is to provide all the necessary resources to 
our military in order to protect our country from terrorist threats.

I would like to especially recognize our U.S. Special Operations 
Forces, who have been an integral part of our counterterrorism 
strategy. The U.S. Special Operation Forces have been successful in 
developing valuable relationships with the governments in Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, ultimately leading to the capture of hundreds of al Qaeda 
fighters and affiliates.

However, terrorism is not limited to Iraq and Afghanistan. Currently, 
our forces are also in regions such as Yemen to root out terrorists and 
send a loud message to those who seek to do us harm that we will not 
let them operate freely like that.

Congress must be proactive about addressing all terrorist threats to 
our country through intelligence, diplomacy and with our Armed Forces.
