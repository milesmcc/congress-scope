Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Army 
Specialist Kyle Wright, a 22-year-old from Romeoville, Illinois, who 
was killed in combat on January 13 while serving our country during his 
first tour of duty in Afghanistan.

Specialist Wright followed in his father's and grandfather's military 
footsteps by enlisting in the Army, and did so out of a strong desire 
to advance the freedoms and liberties of women in Afghanistan, a cause 
very close to my heart.

He joined the Army after graduating in 2006 from Romeoville High 
School, where, even as a young man, he demonstrated his love for this 
country by serving in the Marine Corps Junior Reserve Officers Training 
Corps.

He was passionate, honorable, and loved by all who knew him, his 
family, his girlfriend, and his fellow soldiers. His dedication to 
women's rights in Afghanistan was inspired by his sisters, his mother, 
stepmother, and grandmother. And his dedication to upholding the 
American ideals and freedoms he believed in knew no bounds.

I would like to extend my deepest condolence to the Wright family and 
to all who knew this brave soldier. Our Nation lost a true hero with 
Specialist Wright's passing. He will be missed.
