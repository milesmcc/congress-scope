Mr. McMAHON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment which I offer along 
with my esteemed colleague from Connecticut, the great Congresswoman 
Rosa DeLauro, together with my great colleague from Connecticut, Joe 
Courtney, and my great colleague from the great State of New Mexico, 
Harry Teague.

Like my colleagues, I too am alarmed at the statistics coming out of 
the armed services. Nearly 150 soldiers took their lives last year, the 
highest figures since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began.

In 2009, it is already reporting 64 potential active-duty Army 
suicides. One-to-one mental health screenings with a certified mental 
health professional is the least that we can offer to our servicemen 
and women that sacrifice so much for this country.

This amendment creates a well thought-out pilot program that would 
assess the feasibility of such screenings and would hopefully lead to 
legislation in a broader sense.

For this reason, I urge my colleagues here today to support this 
amendment on behalf of the men and women who serve this country so 
proudly.
