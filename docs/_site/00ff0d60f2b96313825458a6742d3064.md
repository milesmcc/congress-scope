`Mr. LANTOS â€” 25 July 2007`

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding.

I want to thank my good friend and colleague from the Bay Area, 
Barbara Lee, for bringing this timely legislation before us today.

The last thing Congress and the American people want in Iraq is to 
keep U.S. troops there permanently. We need a rational and reasonable 
exit strategy. Yet the administration has signaled that it intends, 
instead, to put down roots in Iraqi soil, soil that is already soaked 
with the blood of our soldiers and countless Iraqis.

Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. Building huge military bases in Iraq 
to last the ages is not the answer. We want to bring our servicemen and 
servicewomen home to Nebraska and Idaho and California. Our legislation 
will prohibit spending funds to establish permanent military bases in 
Iraq, and I support it wholeheartedly.

Let me be clear. This measure does not prohibit us from protecting 
our embassy and other vital interests and fighting terrorism. It only 
ensures that our troops do not put down permanent roots.

The administration has drawn a parallel between our proposed, 
sustained presence in Iraq and the U.S. obligation to South Korea after 
the Korean War. Mr. Speaker, we have been in South Korea for more than 
54 years, and I hope we won't be as long as that in Iraq.

The Korean peninsula for over half a century was vital to our 
security interests during the Cold War, but Iraq is not Korea. It is 
now beyond question that our national security is being harmed, not 
helped, by our continuing vast footprint in Iraq.

As long as huge numbers of our forces are there, the Iraqi Government 
will limp along, failing to undertake the far-reaching political and 
security changes desperately needed to promote lasting stability in 
that long-suffering country.

And it will only anger the Iraqi people to promote the erroneous 
impression that our troops will be there permanently. In fact, a 
commitment not


to establish permanent bases may facilitate an earlier, safer, more 
orderly exit, as it will reassure Iraqis that our intention is not to 
have a permanent presence in that country.

I, therefore, strongly support this resolution to ensure that the 
administration heads in the right direction in Iraq.
