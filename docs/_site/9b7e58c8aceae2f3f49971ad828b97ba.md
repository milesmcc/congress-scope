Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the 
Bunning coal to liquid fuel amendment. This was an amendment 
cosponsored and championed by our dear late friend, Senator Craig 
Thomas. If we could adopt this amendment and pass it into law, I think 
it would be a fitting tribute to the memory of this very fine servant 
of the people of Wyoming and of the United States.

We have plenty of Members of the Senate who would like to reduce our 
involvement in the Middle East. Maybe they supported our gulf and Iraq 
wars; maybe they did not, but they would sure like us to reduce our 
current involvement, and they certainly would like us not to have to go 
over there every time there is trouble. Count me in as one of that 
broader group.

There is another group of Senators, and I would be included in those 
as well, that would like us to improve the environment by reducing 
greenhouse gases. They support reducing the lifecycle greenhouse gases 
emitted during the production of fuels. Indeed, we are considering 
provisions to require biofuels produce 20 percent less lifecycle 
greenhouse gases during their production.

So I ask those Senators--all of you who support reducing our 
dependence on Middle Eastern oil, all of you who support requiring 
fuels to produce less greenhouse gases--please support the Bunning-
Domenici coal to liquid fuel amendment that will do both.

Domestically produced fuel made from coal will reduce our dependence 
on Middle Eastern oil. Every barrel of oil we produce from America is a 
barrel of oil we do not need to import from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq 
or Venezuela. Every barrel of oil we produce from America will reduce 
our need by that much to intervene in local Middle Eastern disputes.

Domestically produced fuel made from coal will improve the 
environment. Coal to liquid fuel, with its sequestration of pollutants, 
will be lower in acid rain-causing sulfur and soot-producing 
particulate matter. The Bunning amendment will also cut greenhouse gas 
emissions compared to gasoline production by mandating 20 percent less 
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. No coal to liquid plant will 
receive a cent of Government money unless it can meet this greenhouse 
gas reduction requirement.

Domestically produced fuel from coal will improve our health. Too 
many children and elderly suffer from asthma, an acute condition caused 
by air pollution. Coal to liquid fuel is lower in ozone-causing 
nitrogen oxides, soot-producing particulate matter, as I mentioned, and 
toxic emissions from volatile organic compounds.

Domestically produced fuel made from coal will improve the 
performance of our military. Coal to liquid fuel provides significant 
performance advantages for military jets and aircraft. The Air Force is 
most interested in signing long-term supply contracts that will enable 
them to provide a market for the clean coal to liquid fuel which is 
envisioned in this amendment. CTL fuel burns at a lower temperature, 
burns cleaner, and performs better at both lower and higher 
temperatures. That is good for our war fighters who need every 
advantage they can get.

Domestically produced fuel made from coal is good for our existing 
infrastructure. Coal to liquid fuel can go right into our existing 
pipelines, gas tanks, and engines without any cause of problems. We 
will not need new pipelines, new storage or new pumps as with biofuels.

Domestically produced fuel made from coal is also good for consumers. 
Coal to liquids offer long-term supply guarantees without the fear of 
supply shocks from external forces in other countries. Do you ever 
wonder why gas prices jump up every time some Middle Eastern radical 
shoots off a rocket in his neighbor's territory? That would not happen 
to the fuel we are producing from coal to liquids.

Domestically produced fuel made from coal is also good for taxpayers. 
Coal to liquids offers the ability to lock in long-term price cut 
guarantees. I think all of us realize that Southwest Airlines used this 
long-term fuel supply hedging to save billions of dollars and avoid 
bankruptcy. Other airlines lost millions and fell into bankruptcy 
paying for high-priced fuel on the spot market. At the same time, 
Southwest produced profits in part from the savings from their long-
term contracts to buy fuel. We can use this same strategy to benefit 
all Americans with coal to liquids and specifically by supplying that 
fuel to the Air Force and other Government users. I would hope the 
other users of fuel would realize the advantage, but we can do 
something now to start that market and to assure that technology goes 
into production.

So I urge my colleagues to give a hard look to the Bunning-Domenici 
coal to liquid fuel standard amendment. I would say, I would add Craig 
Thomas's name to that list as well. Sponsors have trimmed back the 
amendment to require more modest and realistic amounts of CTL fuel. 
Sponsors have also included the same 20-percent lifecycle greenhouse 
gas reduction mandate and a requirement for coal to liquid plants to 
operate with technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions.

We can use the carbon dioxide, so captured, to pump into previously 
depleted oil wells to generate more production or we can pump it into 
substructures, geological formations, which will capture and keep that 
CO2 sequestered.

I urge my colleagues to support the Bunning-Domenici amendment. Our 
future in terms of energy independence, our future in terms of a 
cleaner environment depends on it.



I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
