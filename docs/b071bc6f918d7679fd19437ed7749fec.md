`Mr. VAN HOLLEN â€” 19 June 2008`

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, this Emergency Supplemental bill 
presents the House with two very distinct amendments--and two very 
separate decisions.

The first amendment we are being asked to consider would provide 
$165.4 billion for the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. My 
position on the war in Iraq is clear. I believe the decision to invade 
Iraq was a mistake. And I simply cannot support giving this President a 
blank check to further mishandle our involvement in Iraq. Because this 
amendment does not include the conditions that were contained in the 
bill that the House passed, I will be voting no on this portion of the 
Supplemental today.

While I oppose this war, I have nothing but admiration and gratitude 
for our fellow citizens who choose to serve this Nation in uniform. It 
is in large measure because of my respect for their honorable service 
that I will be proud to support the second amendment before us today.

A centerpiece of this second amendment is a GI Bill for the 21st 
century. Just as a grateful Nation expanded opportunities for GIs 
returning home from World War II over 60 years ago, so now must our 
generation invest in our soldiers returning home from Iraq and 
Afghanistan so that they can get a 4-year college education. We have an 
obligation to invest in their future.

With the Nation's economy slowing, and our unemployment rate on the 
rise, this second amendment also appropriately includes a 13-week 
extension in unemployment benefits to sustain our fellow citizens and 
their families as they continue to look for work.

I am particularly pleased that this amendment places a moratorium on 
six Medicaid regulations that had threatened to cut needed services to 
those who rely on them--and that we have moved quickly to provide over 
$2.65 billion in disaster relief to assist in the recovery efforts 
after the tornadoes and flooding in the Midwest.

Finally, we can be proud that this amendment invests $550 million in 
critical scientific research to expand our medical knowledge, improve 
our energy efficiency and enhance our global competitiveness--including 
a $150 million investment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
$150 million for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), $62.5 million 
for the Department of Energy's Office of Science, $62.5 million for the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and $62.5 million 
for the National Science Foundation (NSF).

For these reasons, this second amendment is exceptionally worthy of 
our support,
