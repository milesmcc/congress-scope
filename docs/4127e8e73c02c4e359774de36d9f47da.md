Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I too today rise with a heavy 
heart. We learned early this morning that America lost a great patriot, 
Roslyn Littman Schulte, who was killed this morning just north of Kabul 
by a roadside bomb.

First Lieutenant Schulte, an intelligence officer in the United 
States Air Force, was serving in Afghanistan. She was only 25 years 
old.

A 2006 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, Roslyn was 
born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri.

I am heartbroken for a good friend of many of us, Todd Schulte, chief 
of staff to Congressman Scott Murphy, who is Roslyn's brother. It is on 
days like today that we must remind ourselves of the great sacrifices 
that members of the armed services and their families make in defense 
of freedom and the security of the United States.

My thoughts and prayers are with her parents, Bob and Suzy, her 
brother Todd, her extended family and her unit at this grievous time.
