Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this resolution has rightly earned a place 
on this uncontested Suspension Calendar. So long as it is not 
misinterpreted as suggesting that Congress supports a long-term troop 
presence in Iraq, it merely generates another report that does no harm 
and not any significant good.

We know that, in addition to the blood of the brave, President Bush 
is hemorrhaging money as fast as he can get it, $3 billion every single 
month, building toward a price tag of $1 to $2 trillion on this 
tragedy.

The Senate version of Senators Kerry and Clinton has a better 
approach in demanding cost estimates on each alternative redeployment 
and in asking that one of these redeployments occur by the end of next 
year.

Our problem in Iraq is not a lack of reports, but a lack of the 
collective will in this Congress to initiate the change in course that 
President Bush will never undertake on his own. And I hope we have the 
courage of our troops, the courage to take that action as soon as 
possible.
