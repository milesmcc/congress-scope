Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my friend for yielding, and I congratulate our 
Chairman Skelton on his great job in getting this bill done and our 
ranking member, Mr. Hunter.

People criticize the Congress, I think justifiably, because they 
think we don't get anything done and we can't ever agree with each 
other. Well, this bill shows that we can get things done and we can 
agree with each other. There are many strongly held opinions about the 
war in Iraq, pro and con. But I think there is unanimity. We should 
show the people who wear the uniform of this country our appreciation 
by raising their pay. And this bill does that 3.5 percent across the 
board. I think there is unanimity that when we send our young men and 
women into harm's way, they should have the best protection. And this 
bill puts $17.6 billion, the highest ever, into up-armored vehicles and 
protective gear for the troops in the field. I think there is unanimity 
that says that when someone is wounded in the service of this country, 
he or she should never be forgotten, ever, when they are in the VA 
health care system. So there is unanimity here for the Wounded Warrior 
Act.

This bill is well worth supporting because it shows the broad support 
in this Congress for the men and women who serve this country, and I 
urge a ''yes'' vote.
