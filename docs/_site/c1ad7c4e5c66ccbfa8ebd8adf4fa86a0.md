Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this 
resolution extending warm congratulations and best wishes to the people 
of Greece as they celebrate the 187th anniversary of their 
independence. In January, I joined a congressional delegation trip to 
Greece, Turkey, Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

I had not been in Greece in over 25 years, and it was wonderful to 
see how far this most beautiful country has come in the last quarter 
century, as hosting the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, made a 
tremendous investment in their infrastructure and cultivated new 
developments which have greatly enhanced their prosperity.

My husband Paul's family emigrated from Greece to Lowell, 
Massachusetts, when Paul's father was 3 years old. His father is 
emblematic of a vibrant Greek American community in Massachusetts and 
across the country whose contributions have helped our Nation survive 
and thrive.

The United States and Greece have longstanding ties based on our 
common heritage, shared values and a mutual commitment to freedom and 
democracy.

This measure rightly expresses the House of Representatives' support 
for the important role that Greece has played in the wider region and 
in the community of nations since gaining its independence 187 years 
ago.

I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
