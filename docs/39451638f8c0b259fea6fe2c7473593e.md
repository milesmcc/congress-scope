Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I now yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction 
over the United States Postal Service, I am pleased to present H.R. 
1516 for consideration.

This legislation will designate the United States postal facility 
located at 37926 Church Street in Dade City, Florida, as the ''Sergeant 
Marcus Mathes Post Office.''

Introduced by my colleague, Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, on 
March 16, 2009, and reported out of the Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee on April 2, 2009, by unanimous consent, H.R. 1516 enjoys the 
support of the entire Florida House delegation.

A resident of Zephyrhills, Florida, Sergeant Mathes bravely served 
with the 94th Brigade Support Battalion, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 10th 
Mountain Light Infantry Division out of Fort Polk, Louisiana. On April 
28, 2008, Sergeant Mathes, at age 26, and two of his fellow soldiers 
were killed in Baghdad, Iraq, when enemy forces attacked their forward-
operating base with indirect rocket fire.

Sergeant Mathes, a graduate of Zephyrhills High School, grew up in 
the City of Sebring in Highlands County and subsequently became a 
resident of Pasco County. Stirred by the terrorist attacks of September 
11, 2001, Sergeant Mathes proudly joined the United States Army in 
2005. He left for boot camp on March 15, 2005, the date of his 23rd 
birthday. Sergeant Mathes was then deployed in support of Operating 
Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from October 2006 until March of 2007. 
Eight months later, in November of 2007, he was deployed to Baghdad, 
Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

As noted by his loving mother, Sue Sawyer, Sergeant Mathes was 
extremely proud of his duty. He genuinely appreciated the strangers who 
often approached him to thank him for his service to his country. 
According to his father, Ralph Mathes, his son loved the excitement, 
challenges and adventure associated with serving in the United States 
Army. His love of family and love of country were further evidenced by 
the tattoos on his body. Alongside the name of his beloved wife were 
two more tattoos, one reading ''United States Army'' and the other, the 
second, an emblem of the American bald eagle.

Sergeant Mathes was full of promise. Just prior to his death in April 
of 2008, he had passed his Sergeant's exam and has since been 
posthumously promoted. Additionally, having married his high school 
sweetheart, Julia, 6 years earlier, he anticipated starting a family.

Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Marcus Mathes' life stands as a testament to 
the bravery and dedication of the heroic men and women who continue to 
serve our country at home and abroad. It is my hope that we can further 
honor his service through the passage of this resolution.

And so I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1516 and 
dedicating the Church Street Post Office in Dade City, Florida, in 
honor of our fallen hero.

I reserve the balance of my time.
