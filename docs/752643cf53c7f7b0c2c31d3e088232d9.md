Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to cosponsor this 
legislation on cluster munitions with my friend from California, 
Senator Feinstein. I commend her for the determination she has shown to 
prevent future harm to innocent people from these weapons.

The problem of cluster munitions, which overwhelmingly maim and kill 
civilians, has been known for many years. Perhaps the most egregious 
example is Laos, where millions of these tiny explosives were dropped 
by United States military aircraft during the Vietnam war. Over three 
decades later they continue to cause horrific casualties among local 
villagers and unsuspecting children.

I have urged the Pentagon to address this problem for nearly a 
decade.

While they have acknowledged the problem, they have not yet taken 
sufficient steps to solve it. We used large numbers of cluster 
munitions in the invasion of Iraq, including in densely inhabited, 
urban areas, and many civilians paid and continue to pay a terrible 
price.

Israel used these weapons extensively in Lebanon, including cluster 
munitions supplied by the United States, and again it has been 
civilians who have suffered disproportionately.

Cluster munitions, like any weapon, have military utility. They can 
be effective against armor or other military infrastructure. But they 
are, in effect, indiscriminate, because they are scattered by the 
thousands over wide areas.

Many of them--between 1 and 40 percent depending on the type and the 
condition of the terrain--fail to explode on contact and remain on the 
surface of the ground as hazardous duds indefinitely, no different from 
landmines.

The duds are exploded by whoever comes into contact with them. Often 
it is a child who thinks it is a toy. The consequences are disastrous--
lifelong disfigurement and disability, or death.

No one suggests that it is possible to completely avoid civilian 
casualties in war. Innocent casualties are an inevitable, tragic 
consequence of all wars. But this legislation should not be necessary. 
Weapons that are so disproportionately hazardous to civilians should of 
course be subject to strict controls on their use.

The Feinstein-Leahy bill does not prohibit the use or export of 
cluster munitions. Rather, it would set a standard for reliability that 
is the same as what the Pentagon now requires for new procurements of 
these weapons.

The President may waive this requirement if he certifies that doing 
so is vital to protect the security of the United States, and he 
submits a report describing the steps that will be taken to protect 
civilians and the failure rate of the cluster munitions to be used or 
sold.

Our bill, which is not aimed at any particular country because this 
is a global problem, would also require that cluster munitions be used 
only against military targets and not where civilians are known to be 
present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians.

This is a moral issue and it is an issue of our own self-interest. 
Using or selling weapons that are so indiscriminate in their effect 
without strict controls on their use is immoral. It is immoral.

Anyone who has seen the horrific consequences of children with an arm 
or a leg blown off, or a part of their face, or their lifeless body cut 
to pieces by shrapnel, knows that.

It is also contrary to our own interest to be using or selling 
weapons which cause such appalling casualties of people who are not the 
enemy. It fuels anger and resentment we can ill afford among the very 
people whose support we need.

Again, I am pleased to join with the Senator from California. This is 
a thoughtful, much needed response to a serious humanitarian problem.

It is also timely because other governments, following the leadership 
of Norway, Austria and others, are meeting in Oslo later this month to 
begin discussions on an international treaty to curtail the use and 
export of cluster munitions that pose unacceptable risks to civilians.

The United States should play a visible, constructive role in those 
negotiations and it is our hope that this legislation will contribute 
to that process.
