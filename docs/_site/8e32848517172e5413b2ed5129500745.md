Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, during the break, I was home in my district 
in


Memphis, Tennessee, and I spoke to 40 soldiers who had been to the 
Middle East. They were being honored. I asked many of them if they 
wanted to return. Most, nearly all, said, ''No. Why are we there and 
what are we accomplishing?''

I asked groups about their thoughts, and almost to a one, they said, 
''Bring the troops home; don't stay the course.''

Mr. Speaker, I would submit to the President that he went to war 
under Donald Rumsfeld's opinion that you fight the war with the troops 
you have got.

Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the President should support the 
troops with the bill that the Congress sends him. We have sent him a 
bill that supports the troops, supports the veterans and, yet, brings 
our troops home. We must end this foolishness in Iraq, the loss of 
American lives and the spending of our tax dollars in a country where 
we are not wanted.
