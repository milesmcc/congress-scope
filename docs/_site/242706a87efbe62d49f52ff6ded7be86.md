`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 20 March 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to address the House 
once again. I am glad to see you there in the Chair. Also, I am glad to 
be joined by Mr. Murphy and also Mr. Ryan. We are pleased Mr. Ryan can 
be here at the top of the 30-Something Working Group hour.

We come to the floor every week, sometimes two or three times a week, 
to talk about the great things that are happening here in the House, 
talk about how we are getting better not only as to oversight but 
appropriations, and also budgeting, making sure that we budget so we no 
longer have to borrow money from foreign nations.

The discussion here tonight is important because we have the 
emergency war supplemental that is coming to the floor on Thursday. The 
Appropriations Committee dealt with that today. To have such an 
important Member like Mr. Ryan who is a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, they have been doing quite a bit of work. I know he has a 
lot to share with us making sure that we sling-shot the troops in for a 
win, and also the folks who have served our country, the men and women 
who have served our country in the past.

Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to note there is $1.7 billion in 
this bill for health care; it is $1.7 billion more than the President 
has asked for. Also as relates to veterans health care, there is $1.7 
billion more than what the President requested.

We had a chart on the floor last week that talked about Democrats 
when we were in the minority putting forth proposals to make sure that 
our veterans had what they needed once they left Afghanistan and Iraq, 
and even for those still in the service.

We have also put additional dollars in as relates to readiness, and 
we will talk about that because we have some definitions we want to 
share with Members.

But since Mr. Ryan has been spending a lot of time in the 
Appropriations Committee working on these very issues, I thought I 
would yield to my good friend and allow him to elaborate on the very 
work they have been doing over the last couple of weeks. I said before 
you came in, Mr. Ryan, that we are so happy you are here at the top of 
the 30-Something Working Group hour because you are an appropriator and 
that is an important position.
