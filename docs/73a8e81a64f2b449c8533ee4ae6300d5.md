Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Yarmuth from the great State of 
Kentucky. And I thought what I would do is I'd share with you some of 
my feelings about how things are going here in Washington.

We were presented with Bush's proposal, which, medically speaking, is 
dead on arrival. It just doesn't face up to and it doesn't really 
reflect our traditional American values of putting people before 
things. People ought to come first.

I am very much opposed to the President's budget which seeks to 
really destroy Medicare and take away Medicaid, which is the health 
care access for those of us who are in the greatest need. And so I 
think we have to take a look at the numbers. When the President 
suggested $497 billion cut from Medicare, nearly $100 billion cut from 
Medicaid, how are these people going to get the essential medical care 
that they need?

I look at it, in the big picture, as this way: We've been elected to 
change the direction of the country and to do four essential things: 
First, defend America. We have to enact, as we did, the 9/11 
recommendations. We have to begin to move our troops away from Iraq and 
back after our real enemies, Osama bin Laden and his followers. And 
they weren't in Iraq when we went there; they were in Afghanistan. But 
we cannot remain in a hundred-year war and continue to borrow money 
from China and spend it in the sands of Iraq.

Everywhere I go in Wisconsin, my good friend, people are telling me, 
Look, you have got our hard-earned tax dollars. Spend it here at home. 
Build our roads. Build our bridges. Rebuild America. Let's not rebuild 
another country. Let's rebuild our own lands. This budget does not 
reflect our values. It doesn't protect anyone except corporate greed 
and those at the very top of the ladder. It doesn't do what we should 
be doing: educating our children, caring for our veterans.

The Democratic budget seeks to put in over $3 billion above what we 
did last year because we have 330,000-plus soldiers coming back from 
Iraq and Afghanistan.



And they need help now more than ever, not just before and during 
their service in harm's way, but when they come home with PTSD and 
other injuries that you may not see that are mental, and also those 
physical injuries. We have to have a budget that makes sense not just 
for us here, but also for people at home.

I have here a chart that shows you the change in real median, which 
is like your average household income, by Presidential term. If you 
look over here right by the right, this is something people in 
Wisconsin understand straight away. We are not better off today than we 
were before President Bush took office. And this Republican policy of 
borrow and spend and borrow and spend has put us in the drink.

There is a difference between Republicans and Democrats. Right now, 
the difference is about $33 trillion of debt on an accrual basis. When 
President Bush took office, we had a debt of about $20 trillion on an 
accrual basis. We are now up to $53 trillion of debt. We have 
obligations we have to meet to those people that we serve and 
represent.

During the Clinton Presidency, there was an increase of $6,100 of 
median household income; with Bush I, a decline of $1,000. So we have 
to return and get back to the basics of balancing our budget, and most 
importantly, balancing our trade as well. We cannot continue to have a 
negative trade deficit with our partners overseas and have any kind of 
economy left at all.

This budget does not make sense. I thought I would go through with 
you, since you are from Kentucky, some of the things that might be 
happening if we followed President Bush's and the Republicans' budget. 
Homeland security grants. In the State of Kentucky, well, you would 
lose $7 million. In Wisconsin, $9 million. Homeland security grants are 
important sources of revenue for small governments and cities and towns 
to help defend America on the local level.

Assistance to firefighter grants, the AFG grants, puts valuable 
equipment into volunteer fire departments across the country, giving 
them communication gear so we can communicate during an emergency. 
Well, in Kentucky, oh, my poor friend, you're not even on the list. 
Let's go to Wisconsin. We're losing $13 million. And Kentucky, $12.5 
million with the President's budget.

What about the Clean Water State Revolving Fund? This is an essential 
source of revenue for guaranteeing that we have infrastructure that 
makes sense, that functions as it should, wastewater treatment plants 
and the like. In Wisconsin, under President Bush's budget, we would 
lose $4 million. In Kentucky, you would lose almost $2 million. It goes 
on and on.

Community Development Block Grants, Dislocated Worker programs. These 
are people-oriented programs that need to have financing to make sure 
that people have a safety net that they can count on.

If you want it in general terms, you used the analogy about a sale, 
you know, 2 days only, or should we say, ''to the rich only.'' That 
sale, that tax break, that has to end because otherwise we're passing 
the buck. We're passing our debt on not to our generation, but to our 
children and our grandchildren because sooner or later these debts must 
be paid.

We're seeing it now with the decline of the dollar. The decline of 
the dollar has caused what? The oil hasn't changed for 1 million years, 
but its value has gone up because our purchasing power for the dollar 
has gone down. The gold hasn't changed, but it now might take $1,000 
someday soon, real soon, to get 1 ounce of gold. So your purchasing 
power of the dollar has declined. Interest rates are going down, making 
your investments, if you saved any money at all and you're on fixed 
income, it's much harder for you now to make it through the week.

As we look at the budgeting process here in Washington, the essential 
difference is there are debt lovers and debt haters. We want to pay our 
bills. We want to be fiscally responsible and socially progressive to 
guarantee that people are more important than things and people are 
more important than corporations.

And I yield back.
