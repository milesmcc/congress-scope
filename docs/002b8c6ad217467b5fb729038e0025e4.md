Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, there are few issues of state as weighty 
as those we discuss today. The decision to engage in military conflict 
affects us all in innumerable ways. There are the obvious effects on 
our military men and women who risk their lives abroad, while also 
giving up many of the small joys associated with sharing life's 
meaningful moments with family and friends.

Similarly, each of us bears the costs associated with domestic 
investments sacrificed at home when we decide to instead spend vast 
sums of money abroad. Each dollar spent in Afghanistan on a Blackwater 
mercenary is a dollar that could be spent keeping a teacher in the 
classroom, putting a cop on the beat, or retraining a Detroit 
steelworker so he or she can compete in the emerging industries that 
will underpin the global economy.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, waging war tests our values as 
a nation. During these periods of conflict, the eyes of the world, 
rightly, are trained on our actions abroad. The ability to inflict 
violence upon large numbers of our fellow human beings demands that the 
American people be allowed to sit in judgment about what is being done 
in their name--to determine if the potent weapons at our disposal are 
wielded in a just manner. The question of whether or not we are living 
up to this highest of burdens could not be more important and that is 
why we must debate the War in Afghanistan here on the House Floor 
today.

While the number of Members who will join my good friend from Ohio 
and myself in supporting this resolution may be small, this vote will 
not accurately represent the views of the public at large. A poll 
commissioned by CNN this January found that a majority of the American 
people oppose the War in Afghanistan. Apparently, as with many issues 
in Washington, those who are forced bear the costs of war are the first 
to recognize a flawed policy, while those who profit from perpetual war 
do their best to blunt any change in course.

As a co-founder of the Out of Iraq Caucus, I remember that it took 
some time for official Washington to comprehend the scope of the 
public's opposition to that war. Thankfully, that caucus eventually 
grew to bloc of 70 Members and we were able to successfully match the 
will of the people with the priorities of the Congress. As a result, 
our troops will pull out of Iraqi cities this summer and leave the 
country by the end of the year.

I believe that, as with Iraq, the Administration and Congress will, 
and must, adopt a course in Afghanistan that will benefit both the 
Afghan and American people. That is why I have founded the ''Out of 
Afghanistan Caucus,'' which acknowledges that peace and security in 
Afghanistan will only occur when the United States reorients its 
commitment to the Afghan government and people by emphasizing 
indigenous reconciliation and reconstruction strategies, rigorous 
regional diplomacy, and swift redeployment of the US military.

It is increasingly clear that our military presence in Afghanistan 
inflames ethnic Pashtuns--many of whom would have nothing to do with 
the Taliban if they did not view the United States as an existential 
threat to their distinctive tribal culture and way of life. By picking 
sides in a 35-year-old civil war, the United States has made the 
necessary reconciliation between all parties in Afghanistan all but 
impossible. Similarly, I oppose the constant Predator drone strikes in 
both Afghanistan and Pakistan, in which one in three casualties is an 
innocent civilian. This violence will breed enmity, when we really need 
to be bringing these warring parties together.

I hope that the House votes today in support of this War Powers 
Privileged Resolution. Regardless of the outcome, I and many others in 
the Congress will continue to organize against additional troop funding 
and for Afghan-centric development policies that will speed peaceful 
and permanent reconciliation. I hope that you will join me as a Member 
of the Out of Afghanistan Caucus and you will support this historic 
resolution.
