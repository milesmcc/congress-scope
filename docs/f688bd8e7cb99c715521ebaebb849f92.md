Mr. HUNTER. This does not help us win the mission in Afghanistan. 
This does not bring our men and women home any faster. It doesn't keep 
them safer. It doesn't build better weapons. It doesn't train them any 
better. It's nothing but a distraction right now so we don't focus on 
the real issue at hand, which is winning in Iraq and Afghanistan and 
bringing our men and women home. That's what's important.
