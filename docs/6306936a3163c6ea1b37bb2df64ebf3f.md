Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.

I support this legislation because it will make America safer. Our 
safety depends upon stability in Iraq.

Now, there are two ways to achieve stability in Iraq. The first is to 
prop up the present government and hope it succeeds.



That has failed. The best evidence of that failure is from Iraqi 
leaders themselves. Last weekend, a Shiite Member of Iraq's legislature 
said, in the absence of enough security forces, authorities should help 
residents arm themselves for their own protection. The Sunni president 
of Iraq said, people have a right to expect from the government and 
security agencies protection for their lives, land, honor and property, 
Mr. al-Hashemi said. But in the case of the inability of Iraqi security 
forces, the people have no choice but to take up their own defense.

This government has failed, and we are spending the precious blood of 
our sons and daughters to prop it up.

The second way to achieve stability in Iraq is to compel a political 
solution. This resolution will do that. It deserves our support.
