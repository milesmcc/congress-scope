`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 3 October 2007`

---


Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Ryan, the only questions that the 
Republicans asked about spending money is when it benefits poor kids. 
That is what seems to happen here. When it is about spending money in 
Iraq, when it is about spending money for private military contractors 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are no questions asked. In fact, they 
decry people who ask questions.

But when it is about lifting up poor children out of poverty, making 
them healthy enough to get up on their two feet and go to school and 
learn, that is when the questions get asked.
