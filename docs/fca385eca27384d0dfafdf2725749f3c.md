`Mr. LEE of New York â€” 28 October 2009`

---


Mr. LEE of New York. Mr. Speaker, while I only had a few months to 
serve with Secretary McHugh, I enjoyed the opportunity to get to know 
this great statesman.

As one of the first Members I met, he was not only gracious but 
mindful of how to respect this institution and make a positive 
contribution.

It's no surprise that Members on both sides of the aisle like and 
respect him. Moreover, his unparalleled dedication to serving the 
people of the 23rd District rightfully earned him a record of strong 
constituent service.

Given his commitment to fighting for our servicemembers overseas and 
at home, I can think of no one better suited to serve as Secretary of 
the Army.

I know he's greatly invested in our future in Afghanistan--especially 
given that Fort Drum was located in his district.

While this is certainly a loss for our New York delegation, I look 
forward to working with Secretary McHugh in the future to meet the 
needs of our military personnel and their families.

I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in 
wishing Secretary McHugh well and thank him for his distinguished 
service to this body and our Nation.
