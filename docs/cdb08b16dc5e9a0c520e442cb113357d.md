`Mr. SALAZAR â€” 23 May 2007`

---


Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to remember a Coloradan lost to us 
in Iraq.

Army PFC Jeffrey A. Avery was just 19 years old when he was lost to 
this life late last month in Muqudadiyah, Iraq.

Jeffrey attended Coronado High School in 2005 and went on to attend 
Pikes Peak Community College, where he was studying criminal justice 
with the hopes of becoming a police officer. He enjoyed the outdoors 
and would spend his summers in California with his grandparents.

But instead of these pursuits, Jeffrey decided to answer his Nation's 
call.

In Iraq, Specialist Avery served as a military police officer, 
training for his future. At the time he was killed, he was manning a 
checkpoint, helping to keep others safe from harm.

President John F. Kennedy once said, ''Every area of trouble gives 
out a ray of hope, and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing 
is certain or unchangeable.''

Private First Class Avery embodied this hope with his service to our 
Nation. He chose to put himself into the area of trouble and to assume 
the responsibility of hope for millions of Iraqis and Americans.

He will be missed by all those around him, and he and his family will 
remain in our prayers.












 Corporal Christopher Degiovine


Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to remember a fallen Marine 
Cpl


Christopher Degiovine of Lone Tree, CO. Corporal Degiovine lost his 
life late last month in Fallujah, Iraq. He was just 25 years old.

Christopher Degiovine was a native of Essex Junction, VT, and had 
made Colorado his home for only a few months. He majored in criminal 
justice at Champlain College, where he graduated in 2005, and was 
looking to pursue a career in law enforcement.

After moving to Colorado, Christopher Degiovine answered his Nation's 
call and joined the Marine Corps in December 2005. He was excited about 
the opportunity, and proud to be serving his Nation. He was promoted to 
corporal a year later, and had only just been sent to Iraq when he was 
killed.

Christopher Degoivine's life was one of extraordinary promise cut far 
too short. His patriotism compelled him to a higher calling, and for 
that every American is humbled and grateful. His service to each of us 
and his sacrifice on behalf of all us is a debt we can never repay.

Matthew 5:9 reminds us: ''Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall 
be called the children of God.'' Corporal Degiovine was one of these 
very peacemakers, and his place will always be reserved in our hearts. 
He and his family will remain in my prayers, and those of the Nation, 
tonight and always.














 Corporal Wade Oglesby


Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the memory of Army Cpl Wade 
Oglesby, of Grand Junction, CO. Corporal Oglesby was killed late last 
month in Taji, Iraq. He was only 28 years old and was looking forward 
to returning home and joining the Mesa County Sheriff's Office.

Wade Oglesby's life was not an easy one. He was a young man who had 
to grow up far too soon. His father left his family when Wade was just 
5, and his mother relocated the family from Denver to the city Grand 
Junction, on the other side of the Great Divide.

As a sophomore in high school, Wade Oglesby's mother Linda fell 
terribly ill, and Wade left high school to care for his dying mother. 
After she passed on, Wade stayed with his younger sister Samantha until 
she became an adult.

August 2004 was a turning point for Corporal Oglesby he found his 
''true calling in life,'' as his family said. He joined the Army and 
found a place that he belonged. Wade's brother Richard observed that 
Wade ''was a soldier long before joining the Army.''

In the Army, Corporal Oglesby found his mission. He was proud of his 
service to his Nation. It makes perfect sense that serving his country 
fit so naturally to Corporal Oglesby's character: he had spent his 
whole life in selfless service to those around him whom he loved. 
Helping and protecting others came naturally to him, and the Army 
carried him on his way.

One newspaper in my home State reported that Wade Ogelsby's motto in 
life was ''float on.'' Even as his life became heavy as a young man, 
Corporal Oglesby found a way to ''float on'' and to continue moving 
forward.

To his sister Samantha and brother Richard: As you mourn the loss of 
your brother, know that our Nation mourns with you the loss of another 
exemplary soldier and American. He will live on our memories for his 
courage, service, and sacrifice.
