`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 26 March 2007`

---


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker, but this Congress 
wants to add up to $50 billion to cover $50 million of new children on 
the State Children's Health Insurance Program. We want to get the Pell 
grant up to at least $4,600 and we reject the President's proposals for 
cuts.

Now, imagine the leadership in the United States of America in 2007, 
Mr. Speaker, 2007 where he is going to say we want to not fund Pell 
Grants, we want to not fund children's health insurance and we want to 
continue to spend $2 billion a week in Iraq.
