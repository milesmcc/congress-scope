Mr. CONRAD. I wish to thank Senator Lincoln for this amendment. We 
all know there is a claim backlog that is absolutely unacceptable. 
According to the General Accounting Office, between fiscal years 2003 
and 2006, the backlog of veterans waiting on ratings claims grew by 
almost 50 percent, including those filed by veterans of the Iraq and 
Afghanistan conflicts.

Similar problems have been cited at the Department of Defense. That 
is an unacceptable backlog. I wish to thank the Senator for offering 
this amendment, which I might add is paid for. I especially thank the 
Senator for that.

We now have the Senator from Wyoming.
