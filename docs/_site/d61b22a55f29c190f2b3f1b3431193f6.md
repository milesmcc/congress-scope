Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, as you know, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease, affecting as many as 30,000 
Americans. What you may not know is that military veterans are at 
greater risk of ALS than those who have never served in the military.

A study by the Department of Defense (DOD) and Veterans 
Administration (VA) found that those who served in the 1991 Gulf War 
are approximately twice as likely to die from ALS as those who did not 
serve in the Gulf. Harvard University researchers found that, 
regardless of where or when they served, veterans are more likely to be 
diagnosed with ALS than the general public. Current research shows that 
ALS is occurring at greater rates in those who are serving in the 
current conflict in Iraq.

The Department of Defense recognized this risk by establishing the 
ALS Research Program (ALSRP) last year and provided $5 million to 
conduct research into new treatments and a deeper understanding of the 
disease. The ALSRP will benefit those who served our country with 
better medical care, and will also give hope to all whose lives have 
been touched by the disease, regardless of military service.

Congress should send a clear message of support to our men and women 
serving in the military and continue funding for this important medical 
initiative. I urge my colleagues to provide funding in the 2009 Defense 
Appropriations Act to continue this innovative research partnership, 
which leverages DOD resources with scientific expertise in the private 
sector and at universities. This research will enable us to take action 
to protect our soldiers and veterans by determining why they are at 
greater risk, and will give us tools to treat all those who suffer from 
this disease.

We need to continue to wage a war against ALS, the disease that took 
the life of baseball greats Lou Gehrig and North Carolina's own Jim 
''Catfish'' Hunter, as well as many other American heroes great and 
small. I knew ''Catfish'' and he was a good man, and he would be proud 
of the work that our local ALS


Association Chapter is doing in his name. The ALS Association is the 
world leader in ALS research and patient care services. The Carolinas' 
Jim ''Catfish'' Hunter Chapter of the ALS Association raises awareness 
and gives support to people with ALS and their families throughout 
North and South Carolina. For each of the past two years, it has been 
named as ''Chapter of the Year,'' and their work alerted me to this 
important veteran's issue.

Madam Speaker, with your leadership, the support of our colleagues in 
Congress, and the help of activists at the grass roots level, we have a 
real shot at conquering ALS for our military veterans and citizens 
alike.
