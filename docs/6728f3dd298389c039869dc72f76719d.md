Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Nation is at war in Afghanistan. 
The commander of the multinational forces says he needs several 
thousand more U.S. troops. But the United States has not sent him more 
troops. Our country is indecisive. Why do we delay?

Our enemy is not hesitant about their determination to continue to 
murder in the name of religion. Our inaction causes our national 
credibility and resolve to be in doubt. It encourages our foes and 
puzzles our allies.

If our troops needed more food, we would immediately send food. If 
our troops wanted more equipment, arms and vehicles, we would 
immediately send munitions. But if our troops want more troops, we 
stall, delay and ponder. Why?

It is said we need time to reevaluate the situation. Well, after 
years of fighting, are we not sure about our mission, our goal, our 
strategy? We are giving the impression to the world and to our military 
that we don't have the moral will to finish this war.

We can delay no longer. Our troops are already in the field. Their 
safety and success is of paramount importance. Let there be no question 
of our


resolve to eliminate the terrorists who threaten the innocents of the 
world.

And that's just the way it is.
