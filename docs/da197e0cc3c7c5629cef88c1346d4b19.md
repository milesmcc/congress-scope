Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds, and I do so to 
say I still have yet to hear the term ''victory'' come from the other 
side of the aisle. I still have yet to hear anyone talk about the 
notion of building a democracy in Iraq so that self-determination and 
the rule of law and the building of democratic institutions can, in 
fact, have a chance to succeed. And there is no recognition of the fact 
that we have seen a tremendous number of reduction in IED attacks, and 
the number of overall attacks has dropped dramatically.

I reserve the balance of my time.
