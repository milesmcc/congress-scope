`Mr. CARTER â€” 4 September 2007`

Mr. CARTER. I thank my friend for his comments tonight. He led a 
really great congressional delegation over there.

My friend from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany) is here. He just came in. And 
I would like to hear what he has to say about his experience in dealing 
with this issue of the war in Iraq. I yield whatever time he may 
consume.
