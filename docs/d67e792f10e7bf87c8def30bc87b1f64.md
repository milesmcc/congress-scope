Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Chairman, I was honored to be a military 
spouse, and I am now honored to be in the House of Representatives and 
on the Armed Services Committee.

I stand here today in support of this bill. This bill takes care of 
our military men and women and it also takes care of their families. It 
provides a raise for the military that is long overdue. It provides for 
their housing. It takes care of our military and our families. And it 
cares for those who are injured, especially brain injuries, which we 
are concentrating on now.

It helps rebuild the military. Our military has been weakened by the 
war in Iraq, and it is now time to support these people. So I am very 
proud to stand here.

It also takes care of the National Guard. It will provide a fourth 
star for the National Guard so they will have a seat at the table to 
talk about the policy in the United States. The National Guard deserves 
this. They also have an increase in the budget of $1 billion.

So I am proud here as a member of the Armed Services Committee to 
lend my support to this and to urge my colleagues to vote for this.
