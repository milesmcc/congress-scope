Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. I did fail to mention that the 
leaders are meeting to see if there can't be a unanimous consent 
agreement worked out relative to the Iraq amendments. Senator Reid 
described that proposed unanimous consent agreement, but that is going 
on.

The Senator from Arizona is correct, we are going to seek to reduce 
the number of amendments that require rollcalls. We are going to seek 
time agreements. We have a huge number of amendments which have been 
filed, in the two hundreds. We made some progress because we disposed 
of 50 amendments the other day.

We very much thank Senator McCain, by the way, and his staff, and 
Senator Warner, for the efforts they are putting into this legislation. 
Senator McCain is a very easy person with whom to work. We are used to 
having people on the committee who are both chairman and ranking 
member, regardless who is in control of the committee, work on a 
bipartisan basis. Senator McCain is surely in that tradition. We are 
grateful for that effort.
