Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, so much has been said, and I think 
we are very clear on the purpose of this bill and the importance of it 
as far as the war in Iraq is concerned.

But there is another aspect to this bill. There are literally 2 
million children who are without health care. I want to at this point 
recognize and give due thanks and appreciation to Congressman John 
Murtha. No State has suffered because of the CHIP program as the 
children of Georgia's 273,000 children who would be without their 
health insurance if it were not for this war supplemental.

When the issue was taken to the White House, he said no. All hope was 
gone. I went to John Murtha, and John Murtha said, we will help you, 
and we will attach it to the Iraqi war supplemental. And he took it to 
Mr. Obey and to the Speaker.

Ladies and gentlemen, I make this plea to you, as the Scripture says 
clearly, suffer not the little children. This is the only hope for 
getting our insurance for our children in the SCHIP program. I urge you 
to not let the children of the United States of America go down the 
drain. Vote for the children of this Nation and for this bill.

Thank you, Mr. Murtha.
