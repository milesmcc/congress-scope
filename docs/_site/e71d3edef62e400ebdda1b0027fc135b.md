Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I was very pleased to see that the committee 
provided more than $3 billion for smaller, more agile, but still highly 
protective vehicles know as the MRAP-all-terrain-vehicle. That is $1.55 
billion above what the administration requested in the fiscal year 2009 
supplemental. We received a lot of testimony on this armored vehicle 
program from witnesses before our subcommittee, including the Chief of 
Staff of the Army, and I had a personal conversation with Secretary of 
Defense Gates. Everyone said that the MRAP-ATV, as it is known in 
short, is absolutely critical to achieving our goals in Afghanistan.
