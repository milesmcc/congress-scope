Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, President Bush declared that 
major combat operations in Iraq were over. To that point, we had lost 
139 soldiers. Over the last 4 years, due to the administration's 
incompetence and lack of planning, thousands more U.S. troops have been 
killed and wounded, hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer 
money has been spent, and now Iraq is consumed by a civil war that the 
President is asking our troops to referee.

It was way too soon for the President to declare mission 
accomplished, but 4 years later, the President seems content to tell 
our soldiers that their mission is not going to be accomplished any 
time soon.

By vetoing the Iraq supplemental last week, the President ignored the 
voices of the American people, his own military generals and this 
Congress. He can no longer afford to be that stubborn. The President 
must work with the Congress to come up with an agreement on how to move 
forward. He can't believe that this Congress is going to roll over and 
rubber-stamp his failed policies like past Republican Congresses have 
done.

Mr. Speaker, Democrats refuse to allow the status quo to continue. It 
is time we accomplish our mission in Iraq.
