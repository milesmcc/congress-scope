Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the 
Republican substitute, and thank the gentleman for yielding.

Among its many shortcomings, this proposal slashes funding for the 
international affairs budget 20 percent below the President's request, 
and 10 percent below this year's spending level. This may be a 
politically appealing thing to do, but it is as shortsighted and 
irresponsible and harmful as any other aspect of this proposal--harmful 
to our national security, harmful to our national interests.

For far too long we have failed to invest adequate resources in our 
civilian foreign affairs agencies. The State Department has been so 
starved for funds that a full 11 percent of its overseas diplomatic 
posts remain unfilled. The U.S. Agency for International Development 
now relies on only five engineers to oversee hundreds of infrastructure 
projects around the world.

This glaring void in our civilian capacity is increasingly being 
filled by the military. Our brave men and women in uniform follow 
orders and do the best they can, but they are trained to be 
warfighters, not development and reconstruction professionals.

That's why Defense Secretary Gates called, according to the 
newspapers, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Conrad last week to plead 
for more money--not for the Pentagon, but for the international affairs 
budget.

The draconian cuts proposed in this substitute could have a direct 
impact on the success of our efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. 
President Obama has correctly recognized that the fight against al 
Qaeda and the Taliban cannot be won by military means alone.

In addition to 21,000 additional troops, he's proposed sending 
hundreds of agriculture and development specialists to help that war-
torn country get back on its feet. This budget would make that possible 
because there's no way they could absorb the additional cuts and still 
do that mission.

I would suggest that the President's number, and not the Republican 
proposal and not the Ryan substitute, is the fiscally conservative 
position in this debate.

I urge my colleagues to defeat this substitute.
