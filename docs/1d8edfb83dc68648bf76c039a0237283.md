Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. We would also agree 
with this amendment. I think they are both excellent amendments. And I 
meant to comment on the other one as well. When the gentleman included 
our Reserve forces as well as other member veterans in Armed Forces, I 
think when one considers how patriotic our Reservists are and how many 
of them, especially with our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, are 
literally putting their lives on the line, I think this is a very 
helpful and important amendment, both of them. And so we would commend 
the gentleman for introducing them.
