Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
for yielding.

I rise today as a cosponsor of H.R. 2956, and although I support this 
resolution, I must express my sadness that it has come to this point.

This President was wrong when he claimed that Iraq had weapons of 
mass destruction. He has had over 4 years. He has asked for more time, 
for more troops, for more surges. And regardless of what our military 
experts and our troops on the ground say, this President continues to 
claim that we are winning the war in Iraq.

Mr. President, what reports are you reading? Whom are you listening 
to? Certainly not the reports that I have read or the military 
officials I have spoken to, who tell a very different story about what 
is happening in Iraq. To me it is with sadness that this Congress has 
to tell you that your war in Iraq is a failure and that we will not let 
you leave our brave men and women over there when you have no plan to 
allow them to succeed. We will not let them be targets any longer.

History will show, Mr. President, that your war was a failure. But 
today the Congress stood up to you and said enough is enough.
