`Mr. WARNER â€” 14 December 2007`

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I thank my distinguished colleague 
from Nevada for his thoughtful remarks. While we may have differences 
on the course, direction, and policies, I don't know of any Senator who 
comes to the floor and can speak with greater sense of compassion on 
behalf of the men and women who wear the uniform and their families and 
those who have borne the brunt of this conflict, not only in Iraq but 
in Afghanistan and other places.

I also ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Virginia, Mr. 
Webb, be granted 2 minutes. He worked with Senator Murray on the 
Wounded Warrior Act. I knew him very well when he returned from 
Vietnam. He served on my staff as a young Marine captain. Had it not 
been for what he suffered in that war, he might still be in the Marine 
Corps today.

I yield the floor.
