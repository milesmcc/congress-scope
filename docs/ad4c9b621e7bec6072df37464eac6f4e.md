`Mr. BOUSTANY â€” 21 July 2009`

---


Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my friend and colleague from Utah and my friend 
from Massachusetts for this courtesy.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 2972, to 
designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 
115 West Edward Street in Erath, Louisiana, as the Conrad DeRouen, Jr. 
Post Office. I'd like to thank the Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee for bringing this bill to the floor.

Today, it's really a distinct honor for me to celebrate the life of 
United States Marine Corps Reserve Second Lieutenant Conrad C. DeRouen, 
Jr., an extraordinary hero in World War II.

A native of Erath, Louisiana, a small coastal town in my district, 
DeRouen graduated from Erath High School, then went on to Southwestern 
Louisiana Institute, and subsequently received a master's degree from 
Peabody College in Nashville, Tennessee.

He married Marguerite Domingues of Abbeville, Louisiana, and at the 
age of 21 he volunteered to serve in the United States Marine Corps.



While fighting against the Japanese forces in Saipan, Mariana 
Islands, on July 3, 1944, Lieutenant DeRouen endured continuous 
exposure to enemy fire in order to guide tanks into areas of combat; 
and when the communications systems failed, DeRouen seated himself 
behind the turret in order to continue the resistance.

In another assault on Japanese forces later on July 8, 1944, 
Lieutenant DeRouen, despite being wounded in the neck by shrapnel from 
an enemy grenade, refused to leave his post with the 1st Battalion to 
seek medical assistance and, instead, continued to fight at his 
station. DeRouen eventually collapsed due to pain and loss of blood and 
was carried off the field of battle by his comrades. He finally 
succumbed to his wounds on his ship and was buried at sea.

Lieutenant DeRouen's actions were an inspiration to the marines he 
fought beside and were a contributing factor in the success of the 
campaign in the Mariana Islands. Because of his heroic death at the age 
of only 23 years of age, he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for 
his bravery in a combat zone, the second highest decorated Medal of 
Honor. Today I join the town of Erath in honoring this fallen hero with 
the dedication of their post office to the name of Second Lieutenant 
Conrad C. DeRouen, Jr. for being the highest decorated veteran in its 
history, a real hero and someone we should all honor.

As we honor Lieutenant DeRouen today, we also must recognize our 
present-day heroes in Iraq and Afghanistan, those who have fallen and 
those who continue to fight, and we thank them as well as their 
families and the families of all of our troops who put on a uniform.

I now ask my colleagues to support this resolution.
