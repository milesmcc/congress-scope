Mr. NYE. I would like to thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, a lot of the legislation that comes through this House 
deals with obscure technical points in Federal programs that most 
Americans have never and will never hear of.

However, the amendment that I have introduced, along with my good 
friends and colleagues from Virginia, Mr. Gerry Connolly and Mr. Tom 
Perriello, is a commonsense solution to a common problem faced by our 
military personnel.

In my district of Hampton Roads, many men and women are regularly 
deployed overseas to Iraq and Afghanistan. When a soldier, sailor, 
airman, or marine is preparing to leave their home and family to serve 
their country in harm's way, the last thing he or she should have to 
worry about is paying a cell phone contract termination fee.

In the last Congress, legislation was passed to allow deployed 
servicemembers to exit an individual cell phone contract without paying 
a penalty, and this amendment will extend that same protection to 
military personnel whose phones are registered through family plans.

The amendment is supported by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of 
America, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in easing the burden 
on our men and women in uniform.
