`Mr. ISRAEL â€” 30 January 2007`

Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I would just close with one point.

I want to echo what the gentleman from Georgia has said. This soldier 
comes first. If you go into fight a global war on terror you better 
make sure the fighters have everything they need. Do not ask them to 
stand in line behind the corporate executives at Halliburton. Do not 
ask them to stand in line behind the CEO of Exxon Mobil who got a huge 
tax cut on top of his bonus, on top of his huge salary. Do not ask them 
to stand in line behind the big pharmaceutical companies that also got 
a windfall from the government in the Medicare part D program, despite 
their record-breaking profits.

The gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman from Arkansas and I 
believe more than anything else that our primary obligation in this 
place, in this House, is to support our Armed Forces and to keep this 
Nation safe. That takes the right priorities.

In the past, the priorities have been wrong. How do I know? Two-
thirds of our National Guard units do not have the equipment they need 
to respond to an emergency or an act of terrorism at home because the 
equipment is sitting in Iraq because we did not fund the war fight 
properly.

It is time to put our soldiers first, not just in our rhetoric but in 
our budgets; and to do that, you need accountability.
