`Mr. WEINER â€” 29 September 2010`

---


Mr. WEINER. This is the day that we can stand up and say, You know 
what? If you really believe philosophically we shouldn't take care of 
these people, vote ''no.'' But let's try not to make mischief. Let's 
try to talk about this in a serious, adult way. And I'm convinced that 
we're going to do the right thing. If this is the last thing we do in 
this Congress, let's, in a bipartisan way, go home to our constituents 
to say to those people in the galleries, We understand, and we get it.

They are the first casualties of the war in Afghanistan, and the 
amount of money that we're going to spend would not support the war in 
Afghanistan more than 11 days. These people have been waiting 9 years. 
Let's not have any more people die because of the attacks of September 
11.

Let's pass the September 11 Act that was sponsored by Peter King and 
Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler. This is something that affects 
every single district in this country. Let us do the right thing. And 
if you believe the right thing is to take care of these people, please 
vote ''yes'' on the rule. Please vote ''yes'' on the bill. Please vote 
''no'' on any troublesome amendments to the bill that come up later.
