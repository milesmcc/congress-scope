Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for 
yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep concern that this President has chosen 
to escalate the war in Iraq instead of charting a course towards peace.

Today, I am reminded of the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., when he 
spoke out against the war in Vietnam on April 4, 1967. He said, ''The 
world now demands a maturity of this Nation that we may not be able to 
achieve. It demands that we admit that we have been wrong from the 
beginning of our adventure in Vietnam,'' we could substitute Iraq, 
''and that our actions have been detrimental to the people of that 
Nation.''

Mr. Speaker, war is messy. War is bloody. It tends not just to hide 
the truth but to sacrifice the truth. And the truth is that this was a 
war of choice and not a war of necessity. It was ill-fated from its 
inception at the highest levels of Government, and persisting in error 
will not fix a policy that was fundamentally flawed from the very 
beginning.

Thousands of our sons and daughters have been left dead on the 
battlefield, and tens of thousands are changed forever, wounded 
physically and spiritually by the brutality of war. Our soldiers are 
the best men and women in the world, willing to sacrifice all they have 
at a moment's notice to protect our freedom. They do not deserve to pay 
with their lives for the errors of this administration.

Mr. Speaker, we will never find the answer to the problem we have 
created in Iraq down the barrel of a gun. The lasting solution to this 
crisis will rise from skillful diplomacy, not military might. The Good 
Book said, ''Come let us reason together.''

We must never, ever be afraid to talk. What harm comes from sitting 
down with Syria, Iran and our allies in the Middle East to help bring 
the warring parties together? John F. Kennedy once said, ''Those who 
make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution 
inevitable.''

My greatest fear here is that the young people growing up in the 
Middle East will never forget this American invasion. My greatest fear 
is that they will grow up to hate our children, our grandchildren and 
generations yet unborn, because of what we are doing today in Iraq.

Yes, we must maintain a strong national defense. We must defend our 
borders. We must bring an end to terrorism. But not at the expense of 
our democracy, not at the expense of the very principles this Nation 
was founded upon.

I want to close by asking a question of old, Mr. Speaker. What does 
it profit a great Nation to gain the whole world and lose its soul? 
Gandhi once said, ''It is either nonviolence or nonexistence.''

Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, ''We must learn to live together 
as brothers and sister or perish as fools.''

It is better to heal than to kill. It is better to reconcile than to 
divide. It is better to love than to hate. That is why we must vote for 
this resolution. We must do more.

We must not place more of our young people in harm's way. We must not 
continue to make our soldiers sitting ducks in a civil war. As Members 
of Congress, we must continue to stand up, speak up and speak out. It 
is our duty, it is our right, it is our moral obligation. We must find 
a way to get in the way until we bring our young men and women home, 
and not to continue to escalate this war.

Vote for this resolution. It is the right thing to do. We must send a 
powerful and strong message to this administration to stop this 
madness.
