Mr. REID. Mr. President, don't you think this great country of ours--
the moral authority of the world--can continue our work, our 
interrogation of prisoners, both military and civilian, by not beating 
them, sexually humiliating them, bringing dogs and having dogs chomp at 
them, like at Abu Ghraib? Do we need to deprive them of food and water, 
provide mock executions, shock them with electricity, as was done 
during the first gulf war to American prisoners who were captured by 
the Iraqis, one of whom was from Nevada? We don't need to do that. We 
don't need to burn them. We don't need to cause them other types of 
pain that are listed in field manuals.

Mr. President, we have 43 leading military experts who have told us 
that. We have had the two people who led the 9/11 Commission who have 
told us that you don't need that, along with former Secretaries of 
State and national security advisers to various Presidents, Democrats 
and Republicans.

America is better than this. We don't need to do this. The CIA can 
get along without having to do all these terrible things. We are told 
by General Petraeus that these techniques don't work anyway and that 
any of the information you get is unreliable. Listen to General 
Petraeus. Let's do the right thing on this issue when it comes up, Mr. 
President.
