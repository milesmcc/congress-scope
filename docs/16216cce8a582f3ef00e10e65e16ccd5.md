# HOW EXACTLY IS BUSH SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS WHEN HE THREATENS A VETO OF  DOD?

Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, last week Democrats and Republicans 
came together in a strong bipartisan fashion to approve a defense 
authorization that prioritizes the immediate needs of our military 
personnel.

While the President believed that a 3 percent pay raise was suitable 
for our troops in combat, Democrats and Republicans in this House said 
our military personnel deserved more, and approved a bill that gives 
them a 3.5 percent raise. The President's response, a threatened veto.

How exactly is the President supporting our troops when he threatens 
to veto a bill that he says gives our troops too large a pay raise? Has 
the President forgotten how much he's asked them to sacrifice over the 
last 4 years? Troops were initially told that their stays in Iraq would 
last a year, only to be informed at the end of that year that those 
stays were being extended by several months as a result of the 
President's troop escalation plan.



Mr. Speaker, if President Bush really wants to support our troops, he 
would reconsider his veto threat and help us give our troops a much 
deserved pay raise.
