`Mr. GOODLATTE â€” 29 July 2010`

Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, everyone here is concerned about helping 
people who are suffering, including New York firefighters and policemen 
and emergency rescue workers and others affected by this, but I want to 
point out what Ken Feinberg, the special master of the September 11th 
Victim Compensation Fund said in an op-ed piece in The Washington Post 
entitled, ''9/11 fund. Once was enough.''

He said, ''Despite its success, the fund has not set a precedent. 
Congress has not authorized similar compensation for the thousands of 
victims of Hurricane Katrina, for those injured by other natural 
disasters, or for the families of those killed in such tragedies. Nor 
has Congress exhibited such generosity toward U.S. soldiers wounded or 
the families of those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

''The same is true of victims of terrorist attacks that took place 
before September 11, 2001. The Navy personnel who died in the suicide 
attack on the USS Cole and the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing 
received no such public compensation. Even the victims of the first 
terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 were denied.''

Feinberg said, ''Bad things happen to good people every day; Congress 
does not come to their financial rescue with generous, tax-free checks. 
In our free society, based on notions of limited government and equal 
protection of the laws, we simply do not expect the government to step 
in whenever misfortune strikes.''

When firefighters all across this country enter burning buildings, 
when rescue workers clean up toxic spills, people are injured, people 
are killed all the time. We do not have compensation funds for them. We 
have normal procedures, normal processes through which people receive 
assistance. Even the most recent compensation funds for the gulf oil 
spill and for the victims of the shooting at Virginia Tech were 
privately funded compensation funds. This is not the correct way to 
proceed.

And this fund, in particular, is bloated. It includes funding for 
more than 20 years, until 2031. It includes far more money than Ken 
Feinberg said was necessary.

I urge my colleagues to not support this approach to solving this 
problem.
