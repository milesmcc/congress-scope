Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today 
to pay tribute to Army SPC Joseph Dennis Johnson. Specialist Johnson 
was killed on June 16, 2010 in Kunduz, Afghanistan by a roadside bomb. 
Funeral services will be held on June 26 at Flint Central Nazarene 
Church.

After graduating from Carmen-Ainsworth High School in 2004, 
Specialist Johnson enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2006 and served as an 
Airborne Engineer disarming improvised devices. He had been stationed 
in Afghanistan since December 2009. Specialist Johnson considered it a 
privilege and honor to serve his country. I had the opportunity to meet 
and talk to Specialist Johnson when we flew from Washington, DC to 
Michigan together several years ago. I was attending the funeral of a 
friend, Jack Maxwell, and Jack was Specialist Johnson's great-
grandfather. As I sat next to him on the airplane and again at the 
funeral, I was impressed by his deep love for our country, his passion 
for his work and his devotion to his family.

Specialist Johnson will be deeply missed by his parents, Dennis and 
Teri Johnson, his sister Jennifer Pollak, grandparents Eugene and Lois 
Johnson and Glenna Maxwell; his special friend Amanda Gauthier, many 
nieces, nephews and close friends.

Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to stand and take a 
moment of silence to remember SPC Joseph Johnson. He has made the 
ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved deeply and our nation is 
grateful for his steadfast duty. His enthusiasm for life is an 
inspiration to all that knew him and his integrity is a credit to his 
parents and family. I extend my condolences to his parents, family and 
friends and I mourn his passing.
