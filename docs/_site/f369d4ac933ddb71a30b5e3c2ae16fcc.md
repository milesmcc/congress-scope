Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Chair, it's a privilege for me to present the fiscal year 2011 
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. I 
believe this bill and the work we have done since January of 2007 is a 
work all of us can be very proud of.

In this time of war, we have continued our tradition of a bipartisan 
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriation bill. It has 
honored in a meaningful way the service and sacrifice of our servicemen 
and -women, our veterans and their families.

With passage of this fiscal year 2011 bill, the Congress will have 
increased veterans health care and benefits funding by 70 percent in 
the last 3/1/2/ years. In addition, we have funded a new 21st century 
GI education bill that 510,000 servicemen and -women, veterans, and 
military children have used to further their education. This is an 
unprecedented increase in Congress' commitment to veterans.

In our book, our veterans have earned every dime of this funding. We 
have, among other things, increased by 10,200 the number of permanent 
claims processors in the VA to reduce VA case backlogs, provided an 
additional 145 community-based outpatient clinics, built 92 new vet 
centers. This bill will add 30 mobile vet centers to serve rural 
communities. It allowed the Veterans Health Administration to hire an 
additional 18,000 new doctors and nurses.

These resources mean that our veterans have better access to the 
health care they need and deserve, including improved access in rural 
areas, increased access for VA health care for low- and middle-income 
vets. Additionally, these resources ensure that our veterans receive, 
on a more timely basis, the services and benefits that they have 
earned.

We have also worked hard to make sure that our military knows that 
the Congress respects the sacrifices that they and their families have 
made each and every day to keep our great Nation safe. We have heard 
time and time again in testimony that the best support we can give our 
military when


they are deployed is the knowledge that their families are cared for 
here at home.

We have listened and funded initiatives, such as:

$2.8 billion for new military hospitals so servicemen and -women know 
that their families will get the best possible health care in high 
quality facilities;

New child care centers to serve 20,000 military children;

Over $500 million in additional funding for barracks, because 
Congress needs to show our volunteer forces from day one that we 
respect and honor their decision to serve.

The Subcommittee for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs did 
not accomplish this alone. There are several key leaders that have 
worked tirelessly behind the scenes to support our efforts.

Speaker Pelosi promised our veterans that they would be a top 
priority for her, and the fact is she has more than honored that 
promise. Her fingerprints are on every bill that has provided for our 
military and veterans in the past 3/1/2/ years through our 
subcommittee, and I thank her for her leadership in these efforts.

Also, we would not have seen the historic funding increases that I 
have just highlighted were it not for the dedicated support of Chairman 
Dave Obey, who, in my book, is the unsung hero of America's veterans.

I must also salute, and want to salute, the VA Committee chairman, 
Bob Filner, for his strong leadership every day on behalf of America's 
veterans. He has truly made a difference.

Lastly, but definitely not least, our ranking member, Mr. Wamp of 
Tennessee, has been a vital partner in putting together this bill, and 
last year's bill as well. Mr. Wamp has a genuine heart for America's 
servicemen and -women and our veterans, and he has championed their 
cause. It has been a privilege to work with him, and also with Ander 
Crenshaw, who has filled in when Mr. Wamp could not be with us in some 
of our deliberations this year. Mr. Crenshaw has truly been a partner 
every step of the way in putting together this bipartisan bill, and I 
thank him for that.

I also thank Mr. Farr on the Democratic side, the vice chairman of 
our subcommittee, who has done an outstanding job for our veterans and 
our military.

Madam Chair, I would like to highlight several key initiatives in 
this bill.

First, this bill continues an initiative begun last year to provide 
advance appropriation for VA medical care. This will allow the VA to 
invest taxpayer dollars more effectively and efficiently, and it is a 
top priority of America's veterans' service organizations.

Second, we provide $190 million to new troop housing for Army 
trainees, over 60,000 of whom are presently living in barracks that 
don't even meet minimum DOD standards. Our 18- and 19-year-old military 
recruits don't have many lobbyists running around the halls of Capitol 
Hill, but they deserve our Nation's respect and support for their 
decision to serve in our military during a time of war.

Third, we provide $200 million for a Guard and Reserve construction 
initiative, recognizing the vital role these troops are playing in Iraq 
and Afghanistan.

Fourth, the bill provides $1.3 billion in emergency appropriations 
for military construction of facilities in support of our military 
operations in Afghanistan.

Fifth, recognizing the mental wounds of war can sometimes be more 
painful and long lasting than the physical wounds of combat, we provide 
$5.2 billion for the VA to continue its improvements in PTSD and mental 
health care for America's veterans.

Sixth, this bill includes funding for 4,048 new permanent VA claims 
processors in order to help veterans receive their earned benefits on a 
more timely basis.

The seventh initiative I would highlight, this bill also continues to 
open up VA medical care to more middle-and low-income veterans by 
292,000, the number of veterans receiving health care since reopening 
enrollment in 2009.

Finally, we want to ensure that historic increases in funding for the 
VA are spent wisely. To increase oversight of the taxpayers' dollars, 
we provide an additional $6 million to VA's Office of Inspector 
General.

Madam Chair, I am going to skip over some of the numbers that we have 
in this bill, but I would be remiss if I did not thank the committee 
staff, very professional committee staff, a very dedicated committee 
staff, for their hard work and long hours during this process: the 
minority staff, led by Martin Delgado, Liz Dawson and Kelly Shea; and 
Erin Fogleman and Gilbert DMeza from Mr. Wamp's staff; and the majority 
staff led by Subcommittee Clerk Tim Peterson, Mary Arnold, Walter 
Hearne, Sue Quantius and Todd Friedman and Michelle Dominguez on my 
staff. They don't get public credit for the work, but the work of this 
bill would not have been done had it not been for their 
professionalism, and I thank each of them personally.

In conclusion, this bill keeps our promise to our veterans. That is 
what the Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS, Disabled American 
Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars have said. In fact, they state, 
''We offer our strong support for the FY 2011 Military Construction and 
Veterans Affairs appropriations bill and we hope that the House will 
quickly pass this critical legislation.''

This bill sends a clear message to America's servicemen and -women, 
their families, and our veterans. We appreciate and respect their 
service and sacrifice.
