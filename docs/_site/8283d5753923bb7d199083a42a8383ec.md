`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 1 March 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Ryan, I appreciate you coming down, sir. You 
are one of the most dedicated members of the 30-something Working 
Group. And I know now that you are an appropriator that you have many 
more responsibilities. And I want you to continue to do those great 
things that you do on the Appropriations Committee, and I want to thank 
you for your service on the Armed Services Committee in the last two 
Congresses. But this is a very, very serious issue, Members; and I am 
glad that you did find time enough to come down here.


Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that we look at some of the 
issues that we are facing here, not only on this article, or articles, 
out of The Washington Post, not only what Americans are going to be 
reading in Newsweek and other publications that are going to uncover or 
shed light on the obvious that so many veterans have been talking about 
for so many years. One thing for myself, being in the political 
minority in the last two Congresses and the frustration of not having 
the opportunity to schedule a hearing, Mr. Ryan said something and I 
want to just be able to shed light on it, because we have a lot of new 
Members and I want to make sure they understand.

Of course, when you are in the minority you can't call the hearing. 
It is what it is, like so many people say on the street. You are in the 
minority, that is it. You can try to do what you can do, but you are 
not going to call a hearing. And the fact that we have hearings that 
have been called and hearings that have already taken place and staff 
that has been deployed to tackle this issue already allows the American 
people to witness change, to witness a new direction. If I said it 
three times in my talk here this evening, I will say it again. In 
politics and what gives people the will and the desire to go vote in 
the first place is to witness change when they feel that it needs to 
happen.

We talked about a new direction, Democrats did, in the last election. 
And to actually talk about it and then do it is extraordinary, 
especially here in Washington, D.C. to be able to go back to your 
district and say we are going to do something about this lack of 
service, outpatient service, lack of priority, cut in funding.

I spoke earlier, and I am going to highlight what has happened and 
then I am going to say what we have done in the first action of being 
able to direct appropriations in the area that it should go in versus 
special interest giveaways, versus you have to be plugged in or 
connected to get certain things out of this Congress just on behalf of 
those that have served.

I just want to run down this line here, and I have a chart here. As 
you know, we have a lot of charts in the 30-something Working Group 
because we want to make sure that Members know exactly what they need 
to know, when they need to know it, so that their constituents and my 
constituents, I can't go home and say, I didn't know that, no one said 
anything about it. These bills are moving around, some of them are 500 
pages. I didn't know what was there. So as we look at what is happening 
or what has happened, we have to reflect on the past to have a better 
future. And that is the good thing about what we are doing here.

Bush and Republican budget funding for veterans: January 2003, the 
Bush administration cuts off veterans health care for 164,000 veterans, 
68 Federal Reg 2670, 2671, January 17 of 2003.

The reason why I read that probably means nothing to the lay person, 
but for those of you that know where to find this information, it is 
gold. As a matter of fact, it is platinum. Third-party validators is 
what we do here on the 30-something Working Group. And on the 
Democratic side, we believe in third-party validators. The Washington 
Post is a third-party validator of what we have been talking about in 
the minority. Now we are glad we are in the majority to do something 
about it.

Third-party validator is a Newsweek cover: ''Special Investigation on 
Failing Our Wounded,'' that we have been talking about and 12 years in 
being in the minority. Now we are in the majority, we are doing 
something about it, what I talked about and what am going to highlight 
again.

March 2003, Republican budget cuts off $14 billion from veterans 
health care. It passed the Congress with 199 Democrats voting against 
it. 199 Democrats. That is House Concurrent Resolution 95, vote number 
82, and that took place on March 21 of 2003.

I think it is important also, on March 2004, Republican budget that 
short-changed veterans health care cut by $1.5 billion.

I think you are getting the message here, Members, of what we are 
talking about here. And I can go on and on and on about what has not 
happened and what we have fought for; but I want you to look right down 
here at the bottom, because this is proof in the pudding and this is 
the new direction, Mr. Speaker and Members, that we speak so much about 
here on this floor, and it gives me great pride. I mean, I feel almost 
fulfilled spiritually, leave alone professionally as a Member of 
Congress, to be a member of a majority that is about action and about a 
new direction.



When you look at this, January 31, 2007, that was just a month ago, 
we had to pass a concurrent resolution or a continuing resolution 
because the work was not done from the 109th Congress that should have 
been done prior to this time. We had to come in and clean it up. But 
guess what, in the cleanup we found some waste and special interest, 
giveaways, and we came up with $3.6 billion in health care funding to 
replace some of the cuts that the Republican majority made in the last 
Congress. I almost feel like an attorney in a closing argument. I can 
rest my case on that.

Now, Members can come down here and spend hours upon hours upon hours 
talking about I love the veterans, oh, I love the troops, oh, my 
goodness, I get teary-eyed every time I see a veteran or pass a post. 
But $3.6 billion is action, and I want to make sure the Members who 
voted against that continuing resolution know that you missed out on an 
opportunity to do something great, $3.6 billion for veterans health 
care.

Now, guess what, Member, if we didn't put that $3.6 billion and had 
an opportunity to do something about what did not happen in the past on 
behalf of veterans, could I speak here on the floor of the House of 
Representatives representing to the Members of this House of 
Representatives that we did the right thing back on January 31 of this 
year?



Sometimes we know of the glory but we have to tell the story, and the 
story is having the will and having courage, willing to do something on 
behalf of those who have sent us here, in this case, since we are 
talking about the veterans tonight, those that have allowed us to be in 
the Capitol, saluting one flag and secure, those that allow my children 
to live in a free society, those that have had friends that have paid 
the ultimate sacrifice, those that it takes longer than 2 hours in the 
morning for them to get out the door because of the price they paid.

Members, this has to be bipartisan, and so when we look at what has 
happened under a partisan venue, we have to be excited about $3.6 
billion and counting in the future. We have to be excited about the 
oversight hearings that I have talked about that Mr. Murtha is going to 
have as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Appropriations. We talked about the Armed Services Committee, oversight 
committee, going and having hearings.

We talked about the Budget Committee that has already had a hearing. 
We are talking about the Senate doing the same thing on that side. We 
are talking about deployment of staff into veterans hospitals finding 
out the damage, what has happened because of the lack of funding that 
has been cut off over the years. That is substantial; that is 
substantial.

I would urge the Members on both sides of the aisle to go home and 
tell your constituents that we are on the job, that we are going to 
make it happen on behalf of their uncle, on behalf of their aunt, on 
behalf of their mother that may be deployed right now. But when she 
gets back, we are going to have her back. That is what is important, 
not lip service, but action.

Now, as a Member of Congress it gives me no pride to talk about the 
failures of the Bush administration or the past Congress, or even this 
Congress. We are not even 3 months into a new Congress. We have had 52 
hearings dealing with Iraq plus, and I have to make sure that staff 
gives me the new numbers when we get back here next week, and counting, 
to give the American people the accountability that they deserve, those 
that are in harm's way, that they deserve.

You let some tell you here in the House of Representatives, oh, 
Democrats are weak on defense. We are for the veterans, don't you know?

Well, you know something, the thing about the story is the fact that 
it has bumps in it. The thing about the Congressional Record is the 
fact that it tells the truth, and the truth will set you free like we 
have heard so many times in places of worship. But it will set you free 
when it comes down to the track record.

We have the Republican side that says the tax-and-spend Democrats. 
Okay, what does the record reflect? The record reflects great 
accountability.

Guess what, the only party in the history of this country that has 
ever balanced the budget was the Democratic Congress without one 
Republican vote, the only party.

They talk about budget reduction and all that, but the bottom line is 
you can't hold, you can't have one arm on special interest and another 
arm on responsibility and make sure it all gets out because you know 
what, in past Congresses, special interest has always won. So as we 
start to look at this issue, we learn more about what is going on in 
our outpatient services, and we learn more about the lack of service 
that our veterans are receiving, not just the new ones, but the ones 
that have been there and suffered for years, and have suffered even 
more of the cuts of the Republican leadership in the White House and 
here in Congress.

The story, goodness, a Republican chairman of a committee of the 
Veterans' Affairs Committee did the right thing at one point and said, 
I am going to do this on behalf of veterans here in the United States 
of America; and those that are abroad at foreign bases and their 
families, we are going to do the right thing for him, and he was 
stripped of his chairmanship. I challenge any Member to come down here 
and challenge me on that fact. They won't, because it actually 
happened.

I guarantee you, the present chairman of our Veterans' Affairs right 
now will not be stripped for working on behalf of veterans. That will 
not happen. I say that with great confidence.

So I am excited. I mean, we just broke for the week. I am just glad 
to be here tonight to just witness, like we say in the Baptist Church, 
a change in a new direction.

I am so glad that the Record will reflect, not just American people 
but Democrats, that when the American people voted for a new direction, 
it actually happened. We are moving in a new direction.

Every time I see the votes on the board right above our heads here, 
we have bipartisan votes, it makes me feel even better about what we 
are doing, because that means that you are doing the right thing. This 
is a partisan arena here in Washington D.C. By the rules it is 
partisan. By the fact that you cannot even call a committee hearing, it 
is partisan. It has been that way for a very, very long time.

When you start to see Members breaking ranks with partisanship to 
say, I need to vote for this very good thing for my constituents, that 
is powerful, because it hasn't happened before; and I am not talking 
about procedural votes to the Members. We know Members are going to 
vote on the issues.

As we start to do good things on behalf of our veterans, we look 
forward to that bipartisan spirit. We look forward to it, and we know 
that there will be votes that we have to be bipartisan on. But I can 
tell you one thing: when it comes down to our veterans, we have to be 
together on this. National security, we have to be together on this. We 
have to be together on a number of issues, health care, what have you, 
because the country is looking for us to be leaders.

I am so glad that we have a Speaker that is a leader. I am so glad 
that we have Members that are serving in leadership positions on 
oversight committees that are leaders and really don't mind being 
talked about and misunderstood from time to time, because the outcome 
measures will reflect, out of the appropriations committees, Ways and 
Means, you name it, the Budget Committee, the priority of American 
people.


They are not just Democratic ideas. These are ideas that are American 
and that are right. We can't point at another country and say, look, 
wow, they don't even have good uniforms, when we are not following, we 
are not doing, we are not leading by example, just put it that way.

So I wanted to point this out, and I am glad that I had this 
information handy here to be able to share with the Members and allow 
them to have a chance to reflect on some of the issues of the week and 
also issues that will be coming up next week.

The last point, and I think this is very, very important, at Walter 
Reed today a major general stepped down. But you know something, it 
goes higher than that; it goes higher than that. A two-star general 
stepped down today from Walter Reed, stepped down, resigned. It goes 
higher than that. This reminds me of other issues that because of a 
lack of oversight have taken place in our Federal Government, and the 
first person to go is the person almost to the bottom of the totem 
pole. This goes higher than that.

I am excited that the Secretary of Defense did go out there, but I am 
going to tell you something. As we start to peel back the issues on 
this issue of failing our wounded, because of a lack of funding, more 
and more individuals, more and more e-mails that will be uncovered of 
who knew what when, who did not act, and it may lead very well back to 
the White House, may very well lead back to the past Congress, it may 
very well lead back to a high-level bureaucrat that looked the other 
way, because it was okay to look the other way.

This is not a witch hunt; this is about making sure that our veterans 
understand that we are moving in a new direction. If the administration 
is not willing to be a part of that new direction and wants to hold on 
to their original thoughts, then we are just going to have to show them 
that direction; and that is going to take courage, it is going to take 
leadership, and I know that the majority Members of this House have 
that courage and leadership.

Again, before I close, I want to commend the workers at Walter Reed. 
I


want to commend those that came forward. I want to commend those 
individuals that have been working for 15, 20 years, taking care of our 
wounded, taking care of our men and women in said communities, and we 
look forward to continuing to support them in that effort, and help is 
on its way. As a matter of fact, help is already there.

I want to thank Mr. Ryan for being a part of this hour. I want to 
thank the Speaker and the Democratic leadership for allowing the 30-
something Working Group to come to the floor one more time. It was an 
honor to address the House of Representatives.
