`Ms. WATERS â€” 15 April 2008`

---


Ms. WATERS. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California for 
her consistent and persistent leadership on this issue of war in Iraq, 
and I thank her for coming to the floor this evening to help sound the 
bell against a possible march to war with Iran.

We have been joined by another one of our colleagues who too has been 
consistent in his opposition to this war. From the very day that he 
first came to this chamber, he made it clear where he stood on this 
war. He has joined with us on the floor on many other occasions and it 
is a constant part of his agenda wherever he is to remind people that 
we are in a war that makes no sense, where lives are being lost, and 
hopes and dreams are being dashed.

He brings a special kind of understanding about what is going on 
because of his familiarity with the Arab nations and with Islam, and he 
has done a wonderful job of helping to teach and introduce to the 
Members of this Congress other cultures and helping us to understand 
how they operate, what they are all about, and helping us to gain 
respect for those that sometimes are singled out for war, when, of 
course, problems and issues could be handled with diplomacy.

I am proud to yield time to Representative Keith Ellison to sound the 
alarm.
