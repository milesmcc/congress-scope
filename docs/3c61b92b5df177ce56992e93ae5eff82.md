# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `3c61b92b5df177ce56992e93ae5eff82`
`Mr. BERMAN â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. BERMAN. I yield myself 30 additional seconds.

And I was here for the vote a year later to authorize military force 
against Iraq. Please don't conflate the two. The fight in Afghanistan 
is the fight against those who attacked us.

I am not endorsing an open-ended commitment. I am not advocating that 
we remain without assessing our progress. But I do believe this 
strategy of our President deserves support, and I urge opposition to 
the resolution.

I reserve the balance of my time.
