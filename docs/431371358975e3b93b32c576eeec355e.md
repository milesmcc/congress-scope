`Mr. HUNTER â€” 29 September 2010`

Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a true American 
hero, United States Marine Cpl Aaron Howell from Potsdam, New York. On 
April 22, 2010, during a mortar attack in Afghanistan, Corporal Howell 
lost both his legs and most of his fingers on one hand. Close to death, 
he somehow summoned the will to live. His life and his experiences are 
an inspiring lesson to us all about the selfless sacrifice and courage 
of the men and women serving in the military today. As Corporal Howell 
meets his latest challenge to rebuild his life, we know that this 
Marine will climb the next mountain and, with his courage and can-do 
attitude, will serve as an example to us all. I ask that this poem, 
written by Albert Carey Caswell, in the honor of Corporal Howell's 
extraordinary courage, be placed in the Congressional Record.

















Howell?



 Howell does one go off to war?


 Howell do you walk though the valley of death, and yourself 





 ignore?


 Howell do you come back from the dead, and rebuild your life 





 again once more?


 Howell do you wake up and see your fine legs, and part of 





 your strong hands so gone?


 Howell do you find the courage, the strength to somehow move 





 on?


 Howell, do you raise your fine head up so high, and want to 





 live, with tears in eye?


 For only such things in a magnificent heart of courage so 





 lie!


 For only such things our Lord God up in Heaven, the courage 





 so gives!


 That against all odds, tells you I still have so much more to 





 this our world to give!


 For only such beauty, but comes and so emanates . . . from a 





 heart where faith and courage live!


 Yea, you Marine . . . who upon battlefield of honor were so 





 bravely and so heroically seen!


 As with your Brothers In Arms, who but did so such many most 





 magnificent 





 things . . .


 Living and dying for each other, all in that most heroic hue 





 of green . . .


 All in that great glory and high honor, of being a United 





 States Marine . . .


 And when on that morning you awoke, all in your tears as you 





 began to choke . . .


 As it was when your fine heart so spoke!


 Don't give in, don't give up . . . finding hope!


 Just Howell, did you find the strength to cope!


 Bringing the Angel's up in Heaven to tears, emote!


 Just Howell, do you wake on each new morn . . . as oh Howell, 





 you inspire us all with your life so worn!


 As you Teach Us . . . as You So Beseech Us . . . as upon our 





 souls your faith adorns!


 For you are but the kind of Son, every Father on earth would 





 wish for one!


 As you make us understand just Howell Heaven is won!


 And Howell against all odds, Thy Will Be Done!


 Now, I know Howell!
