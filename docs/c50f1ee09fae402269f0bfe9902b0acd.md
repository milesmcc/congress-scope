Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Specialist Quincy J. Green, who died on Monday June 2, 2008 of injuries 
sustained in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

operating in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in Tikrit, Iraq. 
Specialist Green was assigned to Headquarters Company, 601st Aviation

willing service, but for the extraordinary person that he was. His 
warmth and optimism brightened the lives of his family and friends.

Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of Specialist Quincy J. 
Green. Specialist Green made the ultimate sacrifice for his country 
while fighting the War on Terror and defending democracy and freedom.
