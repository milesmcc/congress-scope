Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the extraordinary 
leadership of Mr. David Obey, who understands that the strength of our 
country is indeed measured in our military might but also in the health 
and well-being of the American people.

Thank you for bringing this important legislation to the floor.

Mr. Speaker, today is indeed an historic day. Today, this new 
Congress will take the first step: it will vote to end the war in Iraq.

Any statement on the war in Iraq must begin with a tribute to our 
troops. Today and every day we thank our troops for their courage, for 
their patriotism, for the sacrifice that they and their families are 
willing to make.

For 4 years and under the most demanding and dangerous conditions 
imaginable, they have worked together to do everything that was asked 
of them. As Members of Congress, our first responsibility under the 
Constitution, the preamble to the Constitution to which we take an oath 
of office, is to provide for the common defense. We here in this body 
have an obligation to work together to do that for the American people.

Mr. Johnson, our colleague, you, Patrick Murphy, and everyone in 
between who has served our country have helped make it the home of the 
brave and the land of the free. I salute you both.

I would like to also acknowledge two people who have been the 
champions of our troops and experts on our national security in this 
body. The two of them are the leading proponents on the legislation 
that is on the floor today: the Chair of the Armed Services Committee, 
Ike Skelton; and the Chair of the Defense Appropriations Committee, 
Jack Murtha. The two of them care deeply about the well-being of our 
troops, the readiness of our troops and its importance to our national 
security, and they are proposing that we pass this legislation today.

I have said from the beginning of this war, this war is a grotesque 
mistake. Last year's bipartisan Iraq Study Group said: ''The situation 
in Iraq is grave and deteriorating.'' They called for action.

The facts on the ground are these: after 4 years, Iraq is in chaos 
and the


government is not being held accountable. The administration is sending 
troops into the battle who are not mission-ready.



And when they come home, our veterans are not being honored as the 
heroes they are. The revelation of appalling conditions at Walter Reed 
Hospital and VA facilities across the Nation remind us, once again, 
that our troops are being sent into a war without the right preparation 
to welcome them home when they return. What kind of message does that 
send to our troops?

In terms of the chaos in Iraq, our Commander in Iraq, General 
Petraeus, recently said, ''There is no military solution to a problem 
like that in Iraq.'' General Petraeus. Yet, the President's response to 
escalating levels of violence is to deploy more troops, a strategy that 
has been tried and failed, tried and without success three times 
already.

In the short time since the escalation began, disturbing facts have 
come to light.

The admission by General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, that he is, ''not comfortable'' with the readiness of Army 
units in the United States.

The declaration whereby the Department of Defense has finally 
admitted that elements of a civil war do exist in Iraq; in fact, it is 
even worse than that.

Yesterday, in terms of reconstruction, the conclusion of the Special 
Inspector General that the failure of the reconstruction effort in Iraq 
was caused by a lack of planning, coordination and oversight. In fact, 
more than $10 billion has disappeared, with no accountability. Waste, 
fraud and abuse are rampant in the reconstruction in Iraq.

How are we going to win the hearts and minds if the money is 
disappearing in thin air? We must address those and other facts about 
the war in Iraq.

The bill we debate today, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health 
and Iraq Accountability Act, does that by rebuilding our military, 
honoring our promises to our veterans, holding the Iraqi Government 
accountable, and enabling us to bring our troops home.

Rather than sending more troops into the chaos that is the Iraqi 
civil war, we must be focused on bringing the war to an end. We can do 
that by passing this bill that transforms the performance benchmarks 
that have already been endorsed by President Bush and the Iraqi 
Government into requirements.

When those benchmarks are met, or when it becomes clear, after a 
reasonable amount of time, that they will not be met, the bill requires 
that our troops leave Iraq on a schedule that our former colleague, Lee 
Hamilton, a cochair of the Iraq Study Group, called responsible, not 
precipitate.

Benchmarks without deadlines are just words. And after 4 years of 
this war, words are not enough.

As Former National Security Advisor Brzezinski wrote in a letter 
endorsing this bill, ''It is clear that a different approach is needed 
if the Iraqis are to be encouraged to make the political accommodations 
necessary to promote stability and national reconciliation.'' That 
should have been happening a long, long time ago.

Bring the troops home too soon? It is too late for that, 4 years into 
a war, a war in which we have been engaged longer than we were in World 
War II.

This bill, in its wisdom, calls upon the Defense Department to adhere 
to its own readiness standards. The benchmarks were endorsed by the 
President and the Iraqi Government. The guidelines for the readiness 
standards are the Defense Department's own. Those standards are 
intended to assure that before our troops are sent into harm's way, 
they have the training and the equipment they need to enable them to 
perform their missions successfully. That simply is not happening.

The war in Iraq has produced a national security crisis, well 
described by Mr. Murtha and Mr. Skelton and others in the course of the 
day. Our readiness is at its lowest level since the Vietnam war. By 
addressing that crisis, the bill supports the troops, supports the 
troops, and protects the American people.

How do we support the troops by sending them into harm's way without 
the proper training and equipment, without the proper dwell time at 
home, and taking them there and overextending their stays and 
redeploying them over and over again? This bill says, adhere to your 
own guidelines.

Over and over again, Senator Reid, the Democratic leader in the 
Senate, and I have appealed to the President to have a new direction in 
Iraq, change the mission from combat to training, enabling us to 
redeploy our troops for limited purpose in Iraq. Engage in diplomacy, 
encourage the Iraqis to engage in the regional diplomacy so necessary 
to bring stability to the region. Have real reconstruction. Real 
reconstruction, reform it; reconstruction, not corruption. And have the 
political change that is necessary, amend the Constitution to relieve 
the civil unrest and strife that has produced so much violence.

When we do that, we can bring our troops home. We can redeploy them 
out of Iraq, and we can turn our attention to the real war on terror in 
Afghanistan.

A matter of weeks ago I was in Afghanistan with some of our 
colleagues, and the commander of the coalition forces there told us, 
flat out, that if we had not taken our attention away from Afghanistan, 
if we had stayed focused there, the al Qaeda and the Taliban would not 
have the opportunity that they have there now to make a comeback. That 
is where the war on terror is. The war in Iraq is a separate war from 
the war on terror. It is a separate war.

Again, the American people have lost faith in the President's conduct 
of this war. The American people see the reality of this war. The 
President does not.

Today, the Congress has an historic opportunity to vote to end the 
war in Iraq. Each Member of Congress will make a choice. The world is 
watching for our decision. The choice is clear. Will we renew the 
President's blank check for an open-ended war without end, or will we 
take a giant step to end the war and responsibly redeploy our troops 
out of Iraq?

The American people want a new direction in Iraq. Today the Congress 
will provide it. The American people do not support a war without end, 
and neither should this Congress. I urge an ''aye'' vote.
