Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to be 
part of this important legislation which expands mental health services 
for PTSD and substance use disorders, among other initiatives, for the 
brave men and women who have selflessly served our nation.

Nationally, one in five veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan 
suffers from PTSD. Twenty-three percent of members of the Armed Forces 
on active duty acknowledge a significant problem with alcohol use. It 
is vital that our veterans receive the help they need to deal with 
these conditions.

The effects of substance abuse are wide ranging, including 
significantly increased risk of suicide, exacerbation of mental and 
physical health disorders, breakdown of family support, and increased 
risk of unemployment and homelessness. Veterans suffering from mental 
health issues are at an increased risk for developing a substance abuse 
disorder.

A constituent of mine, Lance Corporal Justin Bailey, was a 1998 
graduate of Las Vegas High School. Upon returning from a tour of duty 
in Iraq, he was diagnosed with PTSD, and was discharged from the 
Marines in 2004. He developed a substance abuse disorder and checked 
himself into a VA facility in West Los Angeles. After being given 5 
medications on a self-medication policy, Justin overdosed and died on 
January 26, 2007.

Justin's parents were treated with indifference and apathy at the 
West LA facility. They were even handed Justin's belongings in a trash 
bag. Last August, 8 months after Justin's death, the Baileys returned 
to Los Angeles to meet with the Chief of Staff at the West LA VA 
Hospital. They came away from the meeting feeling the Chief of Staff 
had been completely unprepared and seemed out of touch with the needs 
of veterans. He even went so far as to state his staff does not know 
how to treat veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan because they are young 
and the staff is not tough enough on the younger veterans--giving them 
anything they ask for.

I introduced the House companion bill to S. 2162--the Mental Health 
Improvements Act, H.R. 4053--because it is imperative that we provide 
adequate mental health services for those who have sacrificed for this 
great nation and those who continue to serve. I am so thankful that the 
House is considering S. 2162 today.

Passage of this bill will help to ensure that we have the mental 
health resources and substance abuse treatment programs needed to care 
for our veterans.

The assessments of residential mental health facilities required by 
the bill will help tell us how well the VA is performing and what we 
can do to improve these services, including expanding availability at 
VA hospitals.

The availability of treatment for PTSD, including substance use 
disorder counseling, literally saves lives--so this must remain a top 
priority. A review of the services provided to our veterans is needed 
to ensure that what happened to Justin does not happen to anyone else.

I am grateful that this bill also contains the final authorization 
for the new Las Vegas VA Medical Complex that is so desperately needed 
in Southern Nevada. The complex will feature a 90-bed inpatient 
hospital, 120-bed nursing home for veterans, and an outpatient clinic. 
The complex will be over 900,000 square feet and is scheduled to open 
by mid-2011.

I want to thank both the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and 
 Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees for working together to come to a 

 compromise on a bill that contains many vital initiatives for our 
veterans. I whole-heartedly support S. 2162 and I urge my colleagues to 















do the same.
