# JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE IRAQ WAR REPORT
## `73fb1e9e4bad574225ef522fd8ae8eaa`
`Mrs. MALONEY of New York â€” 15 November 2007`

Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last night House Democrats 
voted to send the President a smaller war-funding package with a clear 
message, send our troops home now. We know this rapid redeployment will 
save countless American lives.

The Joint Economic Committee estimates that a sharp downturn in U.S. 
forces in Iraq, like the plan we are advancing, would also lower the 
war's economic costs by about $2 trillion over the next 10 years.

The cost of this war has simply been too great and the human toll too 
high. We have already lost more people than this country lost on 9/11, 
162 from my home State of New York. In so many ways, we can no longer 
afford to stay in Iraq.

Democrats in Congress are committed to bringing our troops home soon; 
repairing our military; caring for our veterans; and charting a new, 
more responsible, course, a more secure course in Iraq.
