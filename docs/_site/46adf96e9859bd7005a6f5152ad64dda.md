Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that Congress is 
poised to approve a short-term funding proposal for Iraq without strong 
conditions to phase down this war. I, for one, will not vote for it. 
But the sad fact is that we don't yet have a majority in this House to 
end the war.

Yet it is hardly a victory for the Bush administration. Congressional 
support is slowly crumbling, even among Republicans, as the politicians 
are catching up to where most Americans are on this war.

I would urge people not to be discouraged by the vote today, but to 
keep up their spirits and their pressure. Americans will be heard, and 
this nightmare will end.
