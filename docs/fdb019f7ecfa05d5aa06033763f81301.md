# TRUST THE TROOPS

`Mr. SMITH of Texas â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this nonbinding resolution is really 
a nonsensical political statement. It would deprive the generals and 
the troops of the reinforcements they desperately need.

How would you feel if you were an American soldier in Iraq and 
Congress passed this resolution? It is like telling you to fight with 
one arm tied behind your back, and that is no way to defeat a 
terrorist. Let's trust the men and women in uniform who are sacrificing 
their lives to protect ours.

There is a reason there has been no terrorist attack on America since 
2001. It is not because some want to second-guess our military, it is 
because our troops want to win.
