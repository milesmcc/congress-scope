Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I would just close by 
noting that the mishandling of this application is just infuriating to 
read through what happened and to have lost this young man who 
volunteered for our service in such a way is so distressful. But I 
think we can take a stand by supporting this bill named in Kendell 
Frederick's honor to make sure this does not happen to another 
serviceman or servicewoman and also that his family can know that in 
addition to serving in Iraq, he served as a model for a change in the 
law and that they may take some comfort with that.

So I urge passage of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
