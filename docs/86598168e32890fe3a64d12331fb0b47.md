# A DANGEROUS SILENCE--FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR ED KOCH

`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 April 2010`

---


Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, no one is more dedicated to 
maintaining the strength of the American-Israeli relationship than 
former New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Mayor Koch is a true American 
patriot who knows that Israel is an indispensable partner in the war 
against Islamic terrorism. Israel, of course, shares America's belief 
in freedom and democracy. Like many of us, Mayor Koch is concerned that 
President Obama's policies have ''damaged the relationship between the 
U.S. and Israel . . . to one in which there is an absence of trust on 
both sides.'' Mayor Koch has written a very thoughtful article in which 
he describes his opposition to the Obama policies--policies which have 
caused the Mayor to ''weep''. I commend this article to my colleagues.














A Dangerous Silence




 I weep as I witness outrageous verbal attacks on Israel. 


 What makes these verbal assaults and distortions all the more 


 painful is that they are being orchestrated by President 


 Obama.



 For me, the situation today recalls what occurred in 70 AD 


 when the Roman emperor Vespasian launched a military campaign 


 against the Jewish nation and its ancient capital of 


 Jerusalem. Ultimately, Masada, a rock plateau in the Judean 


 desert became the last refuge of the Jewish people against 


 the Roman onslaught. I have been to Jerusalem and Masada. 


 From the top of Masada, you can still see the remains of the 


 Roman fortifications and garrisons, and the stones and earth 


 of the Roman siege ramp that was used to reach Masada. The 


 Jews of Masada committed suicide rather than let themselves 


 be taken captive by the Romans.



 In Rome itself, I have seen the Arch of Titus with the 


 sculpture showing enslaved Jews and the treasures of the 


 Jewish Temple of Solomon with the Menorah, the symbol of the 


 Jewish state, being carted away as booty during the sacking 


 of Jerusalem.



 Oh, you may say, that is a farfetched analogy. Please hear 


 me out.



 The most recent sacking of the old city of Jerusalem--its 


 Jewish quarter--took place under the Jordanians in 1948 in 


 the first war between the Jews and the Arabs, with at least 


 five Muslim states--Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq--


 seeking to destroy the Jewish state. At that time, Jordan 


 conquered East Jerusalem and the West Bank and expelled every 


 Jew living in the Jewish quarter of the old city, destroying 


 every building, including the synagogues in the old quarter 


 and expelling from every part of Judea and Samaria every Jew 


 living there so that for the first time in thousands of 


 years, the old walled city of Jerusalem and the adjacent West 


 Bank were ''Judenrein''--a term used by the Nazis to indicate 


 the forced removal or murder of all Jews.



 Jews had lived for centuries in Hebron, the city where 


 Abraham, the first Jew, pitched his tent and where he now 


 lies buried, it is believed, in a tomb with his wife, Sarah, 


 as well as other ancient Jewish patriarchs and matriarchs. I 


 have visited that tomb and at the time asked an Israeli 


 soldier guarding it--so that it was open to all pilgrims, 


 Christians, Muslims and Jews--''where is the seventh step 


 leading to the tomb of Abraham and Sarah,'' which was the 


 furthest entry for Jews when the Muslims were the authority 


 controlling the holy place? He replied, ''When we retook and 


 reunited the whole city of Jerusalem and conquered the West 


 Bank in 1967, we removed the steps, so now everyone can 


 enter,'' whereas when Muslims were in charge of the tomb, no 


 Jew could enter it. And I did.



 I am not a religious person. I am comfortable in a 


 synagogue, but generally attend only twice a year, on the 


 high holidays. When I entered the tomb of Abraham and Sarah, 


 as I recall, I felt connected with my past and the traditions 


 of my people. One is a Jew first by birth and then by 


 religion. Those who leave their religion, remain Jews forever 


 by virtue of their birth. If they don't think so, let them 


 ask their neighbors, who will remind them. I recall the words 


 of the columnist Robert Novak, who was for most of his life 


 hostile to the Jewish state of Israel in an interview with a 


 reporter stating that while he had converted to Catholicism, 


 he was still a cultural Jew. I remain with pride a Jew both 


 by religion and culture.



 My support for the Jewish state has been long and 


 steadfast. Never have I thought that I would leave the U.S. 


 to go and live in Israel. My loyalty and love is first to the 


 U.S. which has given me, the son of Polish Jewish immigrants, 


 so much. But, I have also long been cognizant of the fact 


 that every night when I went to sleep in peace and safety, 


 there were Jewish communities around the world in danger. 


 And there was one country, Israel, that would give them 


 sanctuary and would send its soldiers to fight for them 


 and deliver them from evil, as Israel did at Entebbe in 


 1976.



 I weep today because my president, Barack Obama, in a few 


 weeks has changed the relationship between the U.S. and 


 Israel from that of closest of allies to one in which there 


 is an absence of trust on both sides. The contrast between 


 how the president and his administration deals with Israel 


 and how it has decided to deal with the Karzai administration 


 in Afghanistan is striking.



 The Karzai administration, which operates a corrupt and 


 opium-producing state, refuses to change its corrupt ways--


 the president's own brother is believed by many to run the 


 drug traffic taking place in Afghanistan--and shows the 


 utmost contempt for the U.S. is being hailed by the Obama 


 administration as an ally and publicly treated with dignity. 


 Karzai recently even threatened to join the Taliban if we 


 don't stop making demands on him. Nevertheless, Karzai is 


 receiving a gracious thank-you letter from President Obama. 


 The New York Times of April 10th reported, ''. . . that Mr. 


 Obama had sent Mr. Karzai a thank-you note expressing 


 gratitude to the Afghan leader for dinner in Kabul. 'It was a 


 respectful letter,' General Jones said.''



 On the other hand, our closest ally--the one with the 


 special relationship with the U.S., has been demeaned and 


 slandered, held responsible by the administration for our 


 problems in Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle 


 East. The plan I suspect is to so weaken the resolve of the 


 Jewish state and its leaders that it will be much easier to 


 impose on Israel an American plan to resolve the Israeli-


 Palestinian conflict, leaving Israel's needs for security and 


 defensible borders in the lurch.



 I believe President Obama's policy is to create a whole new 


 relationship with the Arab states of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and 


 Egypt, and Iraq as a counter to Iran--The Tyrannosaurus Rex 


 of the Muslim world which we are now prepared to see in 


 possession of a nuclear weapon. If throwing Israel under the 


 bus is needed to accomplish this alliance, so be it.



 I am shocked by the lack of outrage on the part of Israel's 


 most ardent supporters. The members of AIPAC, the chief pro-


 Israel lobbying organization in Washington, gave Secretary of 


 State Hillary Clinton a standing ovation after she had 


 carried out the instructions of President Obama and, in a 43-


 minute telephone call, angrily hectored Prime Minister 


 Benjamin Netanyahu.



 Members of Congress in both the House and Senate have made 


 pitifully weak statements against Obama's mistreatment of 


 Israel, if they made any at all. The Democratic members, in 


 particular, are weak. They are simply afraid to criticize 


 President Obama.



 What bothers me most of all is the shameful silence and 


 lack of action by community leaders--Jew and Christian. Where 


 are they? If this were a civil rights matter, the Jews would 


 be in the mall in Washington protesting with and on behalf of 


 our fellow American citizens. I asked one prominent Jewish 


 leader why no one is preparing a march on Washington similar 


 to the one in 1963 at which I was present and Martin Luther 


 King's memorable speech was given? His reply was ''Fifty 


 people might come.'' Remember the 1930s? Few stood up. They 


 were silent. Remember the most insightful statement of one of 


 our greatest teachers, Rabbi Hillel: ''If I am not for 


 myself, who is for me? And if I am only for myself, what am 


 I? And if not now, when?''



 We have indeed stood up for everyone else. When will we 


 stand up for our brothers and sisters living in the Jewish 


 state of Israel?



 If Obama is seeking to build a siege ramp around Israel, 


 the Jews of modern Israel will not commit suicide. They are 


 willing to negotiate a settlement with the Palestinians, but 


 they will not allow themselves to be bullied into following 


 self-destructive policies.



 To those who call me an alarmist, I reply that I'll be 


 happy to apologize if I am proven wrong. But those who stand 


 silently by and watch the Obama administration abandon 


 Israel, to whom will they apologize?
