Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Snap-on 
Incorporated, headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on the celebration 
of the company's 90th anniversary.

The company was formed in 1920 by Joseph Johnson and William 
Seidemann as the Snap-on Wrench Company. Johnson and Seidemann used the 
new concept of interchangeable sockets and wrench handles to start the 
company.

Snap-on products are the foundation for many technicians throughout 
the state of Iowa and America who earn a living working their skills. 
Snap-on Incorporated has exported their business and ideals across the 
country and the world, including a manufacturing facility located in 
Algona, Iowa. Snap-on also continues to be a supplier to the U.S. 
Government since World War II. At the present time, Snap-on directly 
supplies the Armed Forces of the United States of America and NASA. 
Tools from Snap-on can be seen throughout the military operations in 
both Iraq and Afghanistan.

I congratulate Snap-on Incorporated and current chairman and CEO, 
Nicholas Pinchuk on this historic anniversary. I am proud to have a 
Snap-on facility located within my district and wish them great success 
in the future.
