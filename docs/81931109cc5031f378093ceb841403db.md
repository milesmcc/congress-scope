# RESOLUTIONS PROCEDURE
## `81931109cc5031f378093ceb841403db`
`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 7 February 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Briefly, it is hard for me to remember how many times 
we were told by the other side last year that you come to the Senate to 
cast tough votes, but I don't think Senator Gregg's vote was a tough 
vote. Why would it be a tough vote to vote on supporting the troops? To 
me, that is an easy vote. We all will be forced, because of the process 
in the Senate, to cast votes we don't like. If you are in the majority, 
you get more of those than when you are in the minority. I can't 
imagine being, in effect, afraid of voting on the Gregg amendment to 
support the troops. That would be one of the easiest votes we ever cast 
around here.


Let me conclude by saying I am disappointed, as other members of my 
party in the Senate are disappointed, we are not having the Iraq debate 
this week. The distinguished minority whip, in his remarks, summed it 
up quite well. We will continue to talk about this important subject. 
There is no more important subject in the country right now. I know we 
will be debating other proposals in the coming months.
