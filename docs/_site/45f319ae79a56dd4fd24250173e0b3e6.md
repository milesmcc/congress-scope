Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to 
SSG Christopher Stout, from Worthville, Kentucky. He lost his life on 
July 13, 2010, after receiving wounds during an insurgent attack on his 
unit in Kandahar City, Afghanistan.

He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry 
Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, 
NC.

Staff Sergeant Stout is survived by his parents Billy and Sharon 
Neuner of Worthville, Kentucky.

Staff Sergeant Stout was a dedicated husband to his wife, Misty Stout 
as well as a devoted father to his three daughters, Jacqueline, 
Audreanna, and Kristin.

Today, as we celebrate the life and accomplishments of this 
exceptional Kentuckian, my thoughts and prayers are with Staff Sergeant 
Stout's family and friends.

We are all deeply indebted to SSG Christopher Stout for his service 
and his sacrifice.
