# PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENT TO  SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2764, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN
## `516b5ed30d7fc2c922bfcea70fecbded`
`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 19 December 2007`

Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Speaker, as of today, 3,893 of our bravest men and women have 
lost their lives in Iraq. Tens of thousands more have been wounded. 
They have lost limbs, lost their sight and suffered severe brain 
injuries. We have spent half a trillion tax dollars, none of it paid 
for. When is enough enough? When will this Congress finally reflect the 
will of the American people and begin to bring our men and women in 
Iraq home to their families? I hope it is today. I think it can be 
today.

As I mentioned earlier, Madam Speaker, in today's Washington Post the 
U.S. military has found that the strongest point of agreement among all 
Iraqis across all sectarian and ethnic groups is the belief that the 
United States' military invasion of their country is the primary root 
of the violent differences among them and that the departure of 
''occupying forces,'' their words, is the key to national 
reconciliation.

Madam Speaker, I include today's Washington Post article for the 
Record.

 All Iraqi Groups Blame U.S. Invasion for Discord, Study Shows














 (By Karen DeYoung)




 Iraqis of all sectarian and ethnic groups believe that the 


 U.S. military invasion is the primary root of the violent 


 differences among them, and see the departure of ''occupying 


 forces'' as the key to national reconciliation, according to 


 focus groups conducted for the U.S. military last month.



 That is good news, according to a military analysis of the 


 results. At the very least, analysts optimistically 


 concluded, the findings indicate that Iraqis hold some 


 ''shared beliefs'' that may eventually allow them to surmount 


 the divisions that have led to a civil war.



 Conducting the focus groups, in 19 separate sessions 


 organized by outside contractors in five cities, is among the 


 ways in which Multi-National Force-Iraq assesses conditions 


 in the country beyond counting insurgent attacks, casualties 


 and weapons caches. The command, led by Army Gen. David H. 


 Petraeus, devotes more time and resources than any other 


 government or independent entity to measuring various 


 matters, including electricity, satisfaction with trash 


 collection and what Iraqis think it will take for them to get 


 along.



 The results are analyzed and presented to Petraeus as part 


 of the daily Battle Update Assessment or BUA (pronounced boo-


 ah). Some of the news has been unarguably good, including the 


 sharply reduced number of roadside bombings and attacks on 


 civilians. But bad news is often presented with a bright 


 side, such as the focus-group results and a November poll, 


 which found that 25 percent of Baghdad residents were 


 satisfied with their local government and that 15 percent 


 said they had enough fuel for heating and cooking.



 The good news? Those numbers were higher than the figures 


 of the previous month (18 percent and 9 percent, 


 respectively).



 And Iraqi complaints about matters other than security are 


 seen as progress. Early this year, Maj. Fred Garcia, an MNF-I 


 analyst, said that ''a very large percentage of people would 


 answer questions about security by saying 'I don't know.' 


 Now, we get more griping because people feel freer.''



 Iraqi political reconciliation, quality-of-life issues and 


 the economy are largely the responsibility of the State 


 Department. But the military, to the occasional consternation 


 of U.S. diplomats who feel vastly outnumbered, has its own 


 ''mirror agencies'' in many areas. Officers in charge of 


 civil-military operations, said senior Petraeus adviser Army 


 Col. William E. Rapp, ''can tell you how many markets are 


 open in Baghdad, how many shops, how many banks are open . . 


 . We have a lot more people'' on the ground.



 On Iraqi politics, ''we have four to six slides almost 


 every morning on 'Where does the Iraqi government stand on 


 de-Baathification legislation?' All these things are embassy 


 things,'' Rapp said. But Petraeus is interested in ''his 


 'feel' for a situation, and he gets that from a bunch of 


 different data points,'' he added.



 Even though members of the military ''understand the 


 limitations'' of polling data, Rapp said, ''subjective 


 measures'' are an important part of the mix. In July, the 


 military signed a contract with Gallup for four public 


 opinion polls a month in Iraq: three nationwide and one in 


 Baghdad. Lincoln Group, which has conducted surveys for the 


 military since shortly after the invasion, received a year-


 long contract in January to conduct focus groups.



 Outside of the military, some of the most widespread 


 polling in Iraq has been done by D3 Systems, a Virginia-based 


 company that maintains offices in each of Iraq's 18 


 provinces. Its most recent publicly released surveys, 


 conducted in September for several news media organizations, 


 showed the same widespread Iraqi belief voiced by the 


 military's focus groups: that a U.S. departure will make 


 things better. A State Department poll in September 2006 


 reported a similar finding.



 Matthew Warshaw, a senior research manager at D3, said that 


 despite security improvements, polling in Iraq remains 


 difficult. ''While violence has gone down, one of the ways it 


 has been achieved is by effectively separating people. That 


 means mobility is limited, with roadblocks by the U.S. and 


 Iraqi military or local militias,'' Warshaw said in an 


 interview.



 Most of the recent survey results he has seen about 


 political reconciliation, Warshaw said, are ''more about 


 [Iraqis] reconciling with the United States within their own 


 particular territory, like in Anbar. . . . But it doesn't say 


 anything about how Sunni groups feel about Shiite groups in 


 Baghdad.''



 Warshaw added: ''In Iraq, I just don't hear statements that 


 come from any of the Sunni, Shiite or Kurdish groups that say 


 'We recognize that we need to share power with the others, 


 that we can't truly dominate.'



 According to a summary report of the focus-group findings 


 obtained by The Washington Post, Iraqis have a number of 


 ''shared beliefs'' about the current situation that cut 


 across sectarian lines. Participants, in separate groups of 


 men and women, were interviewed in Ramadi, Najaf, Irbil, Abu 


 Ghraib and in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad. The 


 report does not mention how the participants were selected.



 Dated December 2007, the report notes that ''the Iraqi 


 government has still made no significant progress toward its 


 fundamental goal of national reconciliation.'' Asked to




 describe ''the current situation in Iraq to a foreign 


 visitor,'' some groups focused on positive aspects of the 


 recent security improvements. But ''most would describe the 


 negative elements of life in Iraq beginning with the 'U.S. 


 occupation' in March 2003,'' the report says.



 Some participants also blamed Iranian meddling for Iraq's 


 problems. While the United States was said to want to control 


 Iraq's oil, Iran was seen as seeking to extend its political 


 and religious agendas.



 Few mentioned Saddam Hussein as a cause of their problems, 


 which the report described as an important finding implying 


 that ''the current strife in Iraq seems to have totally 


 eclipsed any agonies or grievances many Iraqis would have 


 incurred from the past regime, which lasted for nearly four 


 decades--as opposed to the current conflict, which has lasted 


 for five years.''



 Overall, the report said that ''these findings may be 


 expected to conclude that national reconciliation is neither 


 anticipated nor possible. In reality, this survey provides 


 very strong evidence that the opposite is true.'' A sense of 


 ''optimistic possibility permeated all focus groups . . . and 


 far more commonalities than differences are found among these 


 seemingly diverse groups of Iraqis.''


Madam Speaker, the Iraqi people themselves firmly believe that 
reconciliation will not happen until we leave. If the Iraqi people want 
us to leave and a majority of the Iraqi Government wants us to leave 
and a majority of the American people want us to leave, then why on 
Earth are we still staying?

As I have said on a number of occasions today, what is contained in 
the underlying bill is a blank check. There are no restrictions on the 
tens of billions of dollars that we are going to give the President in 
support of his Iraq policy. There is no conditionality. There are no 
timetables for withdrawal. There is nothing. This is a blank check. We 
are into the fifth year of this war, and after all that we have seen, 
after all that we have been told that has turned out not to be true, it 
seems unbelievable to me that this Congress would vote for yet another 
blank check.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this latest blank 
check, which essentially is in support of an endless war in Iraq, and 
vote ''no'' on the underlying bill. I ask for support of the rule.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the 
previous question on the resolution.

The previous question was ordered.
