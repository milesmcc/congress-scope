Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, and 
as we have been discussing this hour, Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 97 demands 
accountability for how the money is being spent in Iraq.

We all support our brave men and women in uniform. We all support our 
troops. We are all Americans first and foremost, but just as when a 
small town in America receives a grant they must be held accountable 
for how that grant money is spent, so should the Iraqi government.

Again, Washington Post, Monday, April 30, by Dana Hedgpeth, entitled 
U.S. Rebuilding in Iraq Is Missing Key Goals, Report Finds. ''Before 
the U.S.-led invasion, Iraq's power system produced 4,500 megawatts a 
day with an aging infrastructure in which 85 percent of power plants 
were at least 20 years old, the report said. Reconstruction officials 
initially hoped to increase daily output to 6,750 megawatts by the 
summer of 2004, a target later lowered to 6,000 megawatts. But in the 
most recent quarter, Iraq generated only 3,832 megawatts a day.''

What does that mean? The story goes on to say, ''The shortage was 
particularly acute in Baghdad. Before the war, the city received an 
average of 16 to 24 hours of power a day. Last spring, Baghdad averaged 
8 hours of electricity a day.'' That was last spring. ''This year, 
during the last week of March, the city received only 6.5 hours of 
electricity a day. The rest of the country, however, received an 
average of 14 hours of power a day.''

At this time, I yield to the gentleman that helped write H. Res. 97, 
which is of course the Blue Dog bill, to provide for Operation Iraqi 
Freedom cost accountability, to provide an accounting for how this $12 
million an hour of your tax money is being spent in Iraq, the gentleman 
who helped white the bill, an active member of the Blue Dog Coalition, 
the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson).
