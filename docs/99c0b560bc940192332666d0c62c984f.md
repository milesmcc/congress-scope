`Mr. LARSON of Connecticut â€” 25 July 2007`

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
distinguished Congresswoman from California, Barbara Lee for her work 
on H.R. 2929, which bans permanent military bases from being 
established in Iraq. She has long been a voice on ending the war in 
Iraq and I commend her and the work of Congresswoman Maxine Waters and 
Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey for their fortitude on this issue. I would 
also like to recognize Congressman Tom Allen and Congressman David 
Price for their commitment and contributions to the bill.

In-line with the Iraq Study Group report, this bill would prohibit 
the establishment of permanent U.S. military bases. It would also 
prohibit the United States from exercising control over Iraqi oil 
resources. This bill signals a larger issue and bigger picture--our 
presence in Iraq is not permanent. Let it be clear to the Bush 
Administration and the Iraqi people that this Congress will not support 
an open-ended military occupation in Iraq.

The American people have spoken. The American Congress has acted. If 
necessary, we will go on the record everyday until we bring the troops 
home--we owe it to them and their families. I am proud to support this 
bill and I urge my colleagues to join me.
