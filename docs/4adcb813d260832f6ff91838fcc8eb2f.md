Mr. REED. Mr. President, what the President is suggesting to us, his 
policy, is more of the same for a much longer period of time. As we all 
know, recently General Odierno suggested this surge is probably going 
to last not until the end of this year but into next year, and probably 
into the following year. That is putting a huge strain on our troops.

I think also we have to recognize our focus in Iraq, our 
preoccupation with Iraq, is inhibiting our strategic flexibility across 
the globe. It has enhanced the relative power of Iran, ironically, and 
it has caused us, belatedly, to begin serious negotiations with North 
Korea, which might be a profitable and progressive thing to do, but the 
focus on Iraq is serious.

Let me tell you, one of the most interesting comments that I have 
heard is when I asked Admiral McConnell, the head of our intelligence 
establishment, where is the most likely threat coming from, engaging in 
an attack on the United States, Pakistan or Iraq? He answered quite 
quickly: Pakistan.

We have to change our policy. This resolution will do that, and I 
urge its support.
