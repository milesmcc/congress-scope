# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION

Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I believe it is time to bring the United 
States Military's involvement in Afghanistan to a close. Last year I 
became a cosponsor of H.R. 2404, to require the President to issue a 
plan for withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2009; and I voted 
for an amendment to the FY2010 Defense Authorization Act to mandate the 
same. Although a majority of my colleagues did not join me in 
supporting those measures, H. Con. Res. 248 is not the right approach.

It is unrealistic to ask President Obama to remove military forces 
from Iraq within the next 30 days or even the next 10 months as H. Con. 
Res. 248 demands. Ending a war is unfortunately more complicated than 
beginning one. Even as a candidate in 2008, President Obama recognized 
an expedited withdrawal of troops from Iraq would take 15 to 24 months. 
Asking for a 10 month window for withdrawal from Afghanistan is 
unrealistic.

With thousands of Oregon Guardsmen currently serving in Iraq and 
hundreds more deploying to Afghanistan, such a resolution at this time, 
in this manner, would be inappropriate.
