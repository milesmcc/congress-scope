Mr. BYRD. It meets the critical needs of this country. It moves us 
forward in our efforts to change the dynamic in Iraq. We must 
challenge--we must challenge--this President, our President, to open 
his eyes to the truth and adopt the new direction in Iraq that this 
Nation and the world so eagerly--yes, so anxiously--awaits.

I yield the floor.
