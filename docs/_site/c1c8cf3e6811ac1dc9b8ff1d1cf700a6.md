Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2346, but I 
do so reluctantly. I am reluctant because as someone who has spent the 
last 30 years studying Afghanistan and having been in and out of that 
country and being someone who has studied the current administration's 
plan, I am sorry to say that the current administration's plan will not 
work. It is doomed to failure.

Thus we are here allocating money, supplemental money, for our troops 
to send them overseas, but we are not backing them up with a political 
plan, a structure for Afghanistan that will work, that is consistent 
with the customs of the people of Afghanistan. Also their plan does not 
focus on drug eradication and how we are going to eliminate the problem 
in Afghanistan. How will our people succeed without the drug 
eradication problem that we know, the alternative that exists, that is 
being ignored? No. We are sending our people over. They deserve our 
support financially. But we should get together and work with the 
administration to reform their plan because it will not work.
