Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill designating the 
facility of the United States Postal Service located at 101 Tallapoosa 
Street in Bremen, Georgia, as the ''Sergeant Paul Saylor Post Office 
Building.''

Friendly. Dedicated. Hardworking. These are but a few of the 
magnificent words of praise that arise when friends and family speak of 
the memory of Sergeant Paul Saylor.

A native of Bremen, Georgia, Paul was a shining star in his 
community. A starter on the football team and committed thespian, Paul 
was voted ''best personality'' by his graduating class of 2002. After 
graduation, Paul attended North Georgia College and State University, a 
military college.

Tragically, on August 15, 2005, Sergeant Saylor lost his life while 
serving as part of the National Guard's 48th Infantry in Al Mahmudiyah, 
Iraq.

Described by his brother, Jamie, as the ''. . . type who would help 
you, but he wouldn't let you know it,'' Sergeant Saylor served his 
family, community, and country with selfless devotion.

I rise today in honor of not only a tremendous patriot, but an 
outstanding citizen. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution in 
honor of a valiant life that should not, and will not, soon be 
forgotten by a grateful Nation.

I yield back the balance of our time.
