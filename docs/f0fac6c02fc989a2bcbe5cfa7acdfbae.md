`Mr. GRAHAM â€” 26 February 2008`

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Oklahoma will 
return in a moment. If it would be appropriate, I would suggest that he 
go. I think he will go next, followed by myself, a Democrat, then 
Senator Sessions.

I will get started. Senator Coburn, I think, has been to Iraq just a 
week or so ago. I look forward to hearing what he has to say about the 
condition on the ground as he found it.

And to my friend, Senator Feingold, one thing I think all of us 
should agree upon is that you pushed this idea of withdrawing from Iraq 
for a very long time. There is no question in my mind that you are very 
sincere, that you believe it makes America stronger not weaker, and 
that if the polls were 90-10


to stay, you would be doing this, simply because that is what motivated 
you as a Senator.

I have nothing but the utmost respect for what makes you tick as a 
Senator. I know you take on some very difficult challenges, sometimes 
not popular, and this particular piece of legislation, I think, is ill-
advised. I will speak for a while as to why it should be defeated.

But the author of the amendment is consistent, is as patriotic as 
anybody else who will speak, and we need more of this, not less. So 
what is the Senate all about? We are talking about important things. 
There are a million things going on in this country that need to be 
addressed. But I think taking some time to talk about Iraq, where we 
are, where we are going to go, and how we are going to get there is 
probably time well spent. I think most Americans are very interested in 
the outcome in Iraq.

Having just returned from Iraq, I think Senator Coburn can give us 
his view of what he found.

I yield the floor and will speak after he is through.
