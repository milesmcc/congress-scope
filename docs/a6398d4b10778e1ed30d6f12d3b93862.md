Mr. KUCINICH. Let's speak of the consequences of a ''yes'' vote on 
the Iraq supplemental.

A ''yes'' vote would keep the war going through the end of President 
Bush's term. It would provide money to fuel an attack on Iran. It would 
force the privatization of Iraqi oil. It would escalate the insurgency. 
A ''yes'' vote would increase the number of troop casualties in the 
middle of a civil war. It would increase the number of civilian 
casualties. It would create a demand for more troops. It would force a 
cutback in the agenda of many in Congress because money that could be 
used for schools, health care, seniors and the environment would 
continue to be spent for war. It would force the destabilization of the 
Middle East and would erode the public's confidence in Congress.

It is time to end the war; to bring the troops home; to use the money 
that is in the pipeline to bring the troops home; to set in place a 
parallel process to stabilize Iraq. That is what House Resolution 1234 
is about. I urge its consideration and support of Members of Congress.
