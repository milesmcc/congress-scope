`Mr. WARNER â€” 16 July 2007`

Mr. WARNER. I wanted to read the important second sentence--I 
actually wrote this provision myself; Senator Lugar concurred in it--
the second sentence, after addressing the fact that we felt it required 
review by the Congress of the United States. That is the one required 
under the appropriations bill language, which we passed here--not 
passed; 50-some-odd Senators voted for it when I put it up.







 Therefore, as part of the September 15th, 2007, report, 


 Congress expects that the President will submit to Congress a 


 proposal to revise Public Law 107-243.


So Senator Lugar and I come foursquare and address that issue 
straight-on. There is concern. I was one of the four Senators who wrote 
the language, and if I may engage my colleagues, the law, 107-243, 
provided support for U.S. diplomatic efforts. That is section 2.




 The Congress of the United States supports the efforts by 


 the President to



 (1) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security 


 Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding 


 Iraq, and encourages him in those efforts; and



 (2) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security 


 Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, 


 evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies 


 with all relevant Security Council resolutions.



 Section 3. Authorization for the use of United States Armed 


 Forces.


That is the provision Senator Lugar and I address in our amendment. 
That authorization is very short, and I would like to engage in the 
reading of it.




 Authorization for use of United States Armed Forces. The 


 President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United 


 States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in 


 order to



 (1) defend the national security of the United States 


 against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and



 (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council 


 resolutions regarding Iraq.


So one is the benchmark, the underlying statement by the Congress 
which gives rise to the actions today to support the President, but I 
believe that in view of all that has transpired in the nearly 5 years--
this will be 5 years since we passed this in October--it is the duty of 
the Congress to review it, and we have asked in our amendment for the 
President to come forth with proposals.
