Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the people 
of the Republic of Turkey in their celebration of their country's 
historic eighty-seventh anniversary and founding by Mustafa Kemal 
Ataturk on October 29.

The anniversary is cause for us to pause and reflect upon the many 
accomplishments of the people of Turkey, most notably Turkish Republic 
founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's vision of a secular, pluralistic 
democracy.

The United States and Turkey have invested a great deal of energy in 
cultivating a critical and robust bilateral relationship. Time and time 
again, Turkey has proven itself to be a strong ally in our fight 
against Islamic extremism, and a key supporter of our operations in 
Afghanistan.

As the people of Turkey enter their eighty-eighth year, Ataturk's 
vision continues to ring true. I know my colleagues and fellow 
Americans share my sentiments in wishing the people and Government of 
the Republic of Turkey all the prosperity and opportunity of a bright 
democratic future.
