Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 502 provides for 
consideration of H.R. 2771, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act 
of 2008, under a structured rule.

The rule provides H.R. 2771 with 1 hour of general debate, equally 
divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations.

The rule waives all points of order against the bill and its 
consideration except for those arising under clause 9


or 10 of rule XXI. The rule also waives points of order against 
provisions of the bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI.

The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for three 
amendments, two offered by Republican Members and one bipartisan 
amendment.

Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit, with or 
without instructions.

Madam Speaker, the legislation we will consider today, H.R. 2771, 
funds the legislative branch of our government. This includes funding 
for the House of Representatives so Members of Congress have the 
resources we need to serve our constituents.

It includes funding for the Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget 
Office, the Government Accountability Office, the Office of Compliance 
and other government agencies.



The bill also takes a bold step forward and begins implementing the 
Speaker's Green the Capitol Initiative. For the first time ever, the 
House of Representatives will take steps to address the threats of 
global warming by ensuring the House operates in a carbon-neutral 
manner.

The bill provides initial funding to Green the Capitol by switching 
to 100 percent renewable wind energy for the House's electricity needs, 
increasing the use of cleaner-burning fuels, and making congressional 
offices more energy efficient.

This is necessary as Members of Congress must set an example for our 
constituents by being as environmentally friendly as possible, 
especially as we ask them to do the same in their own homes.

Most importantly, however, this bill shows the Democratic majority's 
commitment to change the way our government is run. This bill 
demonstrates a commitment to fiscal responsibility, increased oversight 
and increased accountability.

Madam Speaker, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have 
attested to, this bill is fiscally responsible. It provides an increase 
of only $122 million, or 4.1 percent over the 2007 enacted level. This 
is significantly lower than the 13 percent increase requested by the 
President. And much of the increase is attributable to unavoidable 
expenses that come in a Presidential election year.

Reducing the President's budget request by nearly one-quarter of a 
billion dollars shows that the Democrats are committed to holding the 
line on unnecessary spending, while ensuring that government is still 
able to deliver services to the American taxpayer.

While funding is increased by 4.1 percent over the 2007 enacted 
level, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee chose to 
invest heavily in critical life and safety and security measures for 
the Capitol complex.

The world changed on September 11, and we now know that the United 
States Capitol will forever be a target of a terrorist attack.

We owe it to our staff members, our visitors, our constituents, our 
distinguished guests, and to ourselves to ensure that the Capitol 
complex is as safe and secure as possible.

In a post-9/11 world, we cannot be too lax when it comes to securing 
the Capitol complex. Security enhancements are no longer an option. 
They are a necessity.

The Legislative Branch appropriations bill provides almost $50 
million for security and lifesaving projects, including $5 million for 
new, interoperable police radios, $275,000 for utility, tunnel, health 
and safety process, $1.2 million for visitors escape hoods, $16 million 
for building security enhancements, $1 million for emergency exit signs 
and lighting in the Capitol, and $4.4 million in emergency lighting 
upgrades for the Rayburn Building.

The bill also provides a 7.7 percent increase for the Capitol Police 
Department and a 23 percent increase for the Office of Compliance so 
they can ensure health and safety of the Capitol complex.

Finally, Madam Speaker, one of the defining traits of the Democratic 
Congress has been increased government oversight. As such, this bill 
provides the tools Congress needs to hold the government accountable to 
the American taxpayer.

The Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee is determined to 
crack down on unnecessary spending by government agencies. The 
subcommittee held 11 agency budget hearings and is requiring government 
agencies to reexamine their needs based on priority, cost 
effectiveness, and fiscal responsibility.

The bill provides for additional staff at the Government 
Accountability Office to enable the GAO to better support congressional 
oversight efforts and address important issues such as health care, 
changing security threats, education, and continued audit work on the 
war in Iraq.

The Congressional Budget Office receives an increase in funding to 
better advise Congress on controlling runaway health care spending.

Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz and I discussed CBO staffing in a 
colloquy during a Rules Committee hearing on Wednesday. We both agree 
that the current funding staff levels are insufficient to meet our 
needs. We'll work together with CBO Director Orzag to address the 
staffing and enhance this important agency's efforts in the future.

The bill increases support for the Inspector General overseeing the 
Capitol Police Department. It also establishes a statutory Inspector 
General at the Architect of the Capitol. It is absolutely essential 
that there is stringent oversight of the Architect's office to improve 
its financial and management practices.

The subcommittee is 100 percent committed to improving the oversight 
and completion of the Capitol Visitors Center. I have personally toured 
the Visitors Center, and it is a beautiful addition that, when 
finished, we will all be proud of. However, no Member of Congress is 
proud of how this edifice has been produced. The project has spiraled 
out of control due to an inexplicable lack of oversight and 
accountability in prior Congresses, resulting in unnecessary delays and 
massive cost overruns. This bill assures that there will no longer be a 
blank check and no questions asked.

The subcommittee has held, and will continue to hold, monthly 
hearings, and the Architect will be required to submit a detailed plan 
to the House and Senate before one cent can be spent.

Madam Speaker, this bill delivers on the promises that Democrats 
made. It's fiscally responsible. It focuses on life, safety, and 
security measures, and provides much needed accountability to the 
process.

I would like to thank Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee 
and the full Appropriations Committee for all their hard work and 
thoughtful work that went into this legislation.

In particular, I want to thank the gentlelady from Florida, 
Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz. She has been a true champion for the 
Democratic majority's efforts to bring efficiency, fiscal 
responsibility, accountability to the Federal Government, and to this 
Chamber.

Madam Speaker, this bill is well thought out, well crafted, and sets 
the right priorities. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
