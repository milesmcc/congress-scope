`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 23 April 2008`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 100th 
anniversary of the establishment of the United States Army Reserve. On 
this date, we should take a moment to honor their proud tradition of 
service and sacrifice.

The Reserve was first established by President Theodore Roosevelt on 
April 23, 1908, when he signed into law the Medical Reserve Corps. Four 
years later, the Regular Army Reserve was established, and they have 
gone on to duty and served in every major conflict operation of the 
last century. America's Army Reserve has served in both world wars, the 
Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and in Iraq and Afghanistan 
as the central fronts of the global war on terrorism.

As a veteran of the Army Reserve, the 460th Replacement Detachment of 
Florence, South Carolina, and the 815th Personnel Service Company of 
Orangeburg, South Carolina, I wish to express my immense gratitude for 
the hard work and dedication of our Reserve soldiers. Our Nation is 
safer because of their sacrifice. The best way to protect American 
families is to defeat terrorism overseas.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
