Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, $183.7 billion war-funding request in 
light of more than 4,000 U.S. troops who have died, tens of thousands 
injured, a million dead or more innocent Iraqis, a cost of $2 to $3 
trillion. We're borrowing money from China to fight this war. We're 
ruining our economy. We're ruining our moral standing in the world. 
We're ruining our children's future and making the world more dangerous 
for a war based on lies.

Why do we keep funding it? Support the troops by bringing them home. 
End the war. End the occupation. Close the


bases. Bring the troops hope. Set in motion an international security 
and peace-keeping process that can create the circumstances for our 
troops to come home. Have a program of reconciliation and 
reconstruction in Iraq. Return all oil assets to Iraqi control. End the 
war. Stop funding it.

Vote ''no'' on the war appropriations.
