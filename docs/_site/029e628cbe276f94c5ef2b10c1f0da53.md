`Mr. INHOFE â€” 15 May 2007`

Mr. INHOFE. The main thing I want to get across, I can't get across 
in 3 minutes. But I can tell you right now--and by the way, the reason 
I wasn't here earlier is that I have been, in the last 3 days, in Iraq. 
And by the way, good things are happening there in spite of what the 
press will tell you.

I came back somewhat shocked to see some of these amendments because, 
quite frankly, a lot of people don't understand the process. I don't 
want anyone out there watching what we are doing today saying that we 
are killing some useless project. It has nothing to do with that. This 
is an authorization bill. I will make this clear, but I can't do it in 
this time unless the Senator from Oklahoma would like to yield 5 
minutes of his time.
