Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of my bill, H.R. 3530, which will rename the post office on 
Highway 41 in Inverness, Florida, after Chief Warrant Officer Aaron 
Weaver.

Aaron was a resident of my district from Floral City who gave his 
life for his country while serving in Iraq. After graduating from 
Citrus High School in 1989, Aaron Weaver joined the Army. Aaron's 
grandfather served in World War II and the Korean War, and his father 
was a very proud marine. Following in the family tradition, Aaron and 
his two brothers joined the military as well.

As a member of the elite Army Rangers in 1993, Aaron Weaver received 
the Bronze Star with valor for extreme courage for saving another 
soldier's life in the battle of Mogadishu in Somalia. Weaver's actions 
that day and the battle in Mogadishu were portrayed in the book and 
film ''Black Hawk Down.''

Aaron Weaver also fought another battle. He was diagnosed with 
testicular cancer, but would not let that get in the way of his mission 
to serve his country. The cancer could have easily been his way out of 
Iraq, but instead, Aaron urged his officers to let him enter the combat 
zone. In Iraq, Aaron served as a member of the 82nd Airborne Division 
and arranged to have his medical checkups for cancer while he was 
there. Aaron was actually on his way to a checkup not long before his 
tour of duty in Iraq was to end when his helicopter crashed on January 
8, 2004, in southern Fallujah.

I hope that in the simple of act of renaming this post office that we 
will memorialize Aaron's incredible story. Aaron Weaver epitomized 
courage and patriotism. We must never forget his great sacrifice to our 
Nation.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
