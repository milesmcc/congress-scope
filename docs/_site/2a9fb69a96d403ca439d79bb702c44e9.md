Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding me the 
time.

I believe that the prevalence of PTSD, post-traumatic stress 
disorder, among our servicemembers is a critically important issue that 
we must continue to focus on.

It is distressing that a rising number of our brave service men and 
women are coming back from conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq suffering 
from the signature injuries of this conflict, PTSD and traumatic brain 
injury.

I'm sure that my colleagues are aware of the recent Rand report that 
up to 300,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans may currently be suffering 
from PTSD or depression. My amendment would ensure that recommendations 
have been put forward to close identified gaps in access to care, to 
fight stigma and improve treatment are actually implemented.

Unfortunately, an Iraqi veteran in my district lost his battle with 
the PTSD, despite his parents' frenetic and futile efforts to get the 
desperately needed services.

We must never lose sight of the fact that it's our goal not just for 
DOD to have a plan, but to actually make the changes and do it in a 
timely manner.
