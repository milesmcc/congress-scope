 Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to state my support for 
the extension of unemployment benefits that was included in H.R. 3548. 
Recent reports on gross domestic product by the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis indicate that we are out of the recession. However, 
unemployment is a lagging indicator, and we will need to see more GDP 
growth before employers start hiring again. In the meantime, families 
in Missouri and across the country are hurting. The unemployment rate 
in Missouri is 9.5 percent. American Airlines announced just last week 
that it would close its maintenance facility in Kansas City, and 490 
workers are losing their jobs.

I believe we have a responsibility and an obligation to help good, 
hard working Americans who are struggling in these difficult times. To 
that end, the extension of unemployment benefits will provide a vital 
lifeline to people struggling to find work through one of the most 
severe recessions in our lifetime, and I fully support it.

I also strongly support inclusion in this bill of the provisions from 
the Service Members Homeownership Tax Act, which I introduced. These 
provisions will ensure that our troops deployed overseas this year and 
next will not be penalized for their service when they seek to buy 
their first homes. You cannot shop for a house while you are hunting 
al-Qaida in Afghanistan or supporting a diplomatic mission to NATO 
Allies, so it is only fair that service members have additional time to 
take advantage of the first-time homebuyer tax credit. This bill will 
give members of the armed, intelligence, and foreign services who were 
stationed abroad in 2009 or 2010 an additional year to qualify. It will 
also eliminate the ''recapture'' requirement for servicemembers. Unlike 
other recipients, they will not have to pay the credit back if they 
move within 3 years, as long as the relocation is service-related. 
Finally, Housing Assistance Program benefits that were expanded in the 
Recovery Act will be exempt from taxation. These temporary benefits are 
helping cushion the financial blow to military families who are forced 
to sell their homes in the current, depressed market. Families who are 
reassigned or are relocating to seek treatment for service-related 
injuries are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the program. I would 
note that the cost of extending the first-time homebuyer tax credit for 
servicemembers will be less than one percent of a full extension of the 
credit, and that the cost was fully offset in the bill I introduced.

Unfortunately, H.R. 3548 went further than only taking care of our 
men and women in uniform. It also contains a fiscally irresponsible 
extension and expansion of the first-time homebuyer tax credit for many 
other Americans. I do not support this extension.

Congress created the first-time homebuyer credit last year as a 
timely, targeted, and temporary response to the housing crisis, 
designed to reduce excess housing inventories by encouraging home 
purchases. Judging from home sales over the past few months, the credit 
has helped stabilize the housing market. However, the Treasury 
Inspector General for Tax Administration has found serious instances of 
fraud within the program, and economists have suggested that extending 
the credit is not the most effective way of addressing the remaining 
problems in the housing market. Now that we are out of crisis, it is 
time to let the first-time homebuyer credit expire. We simply cannot 
continue to expand one-time programs from the stimulus and ever expect 
to return to a state of fiscal responsibility. If we say it is a one-
time program, it should be a one-time program.

In conclusion, I applaud the important, commonsense steps we have 
taken for Americans looking for work and for military families. I am 
disappointed that a broad extension of the first-time homebuyer credit 
was included in this legislation. I would not have supported an 
extension of the credit independently. However, the positive elements 
of this bill outweigh the negative, and I support the overall 
bill.
