Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we are told that those who have refused 
to learn from history are destined to repeat it, and it is true. We are 
not learning from history.

I love the President, and I disagree about Iraq. But last night, the 
statements that came to a conclusion had an extremely faulty premise, 
and that premise was that the Federal Government is the only one that 
can properly manage these assets long enough, that has the patience.

That's ridiculous. We serve in this Congress. We can't even keep the 
same incentives in place for a year or two.

China, we just heard, is now telling its banks, don't loan to us. 
They are totalitarian, and we should be concerned about it, but they 
are moving toward capitalism. Let the private sector make its money and 
pay us tax. We are moving that way.

This will be the biggest socialist move in American history, and it 
breaks my heart that so many are thinking maybe this is all we can do. 
The Soviet Union lasted 70 years when they did this type of thing.

We won't make it that long. I beg colleagues on both sides, let's 
look at this and not move socialist.
