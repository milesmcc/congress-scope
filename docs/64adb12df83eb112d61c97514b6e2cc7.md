`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 4 October 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Some of them are saying, well, yeah, I'm with 
you, you know, I'm all impressed, and they go in and take a picture 
with the President in the Oval Office and they go back home or they 
come back over here to the Capitol. That's what's happening very 
quietly. I just want to put that out because that's the way the White 
House has been successful in getting this kind of picture.

Now, I know every last Member here in this picture, and I know the 
conversations I've had with them one-on-one about the war in Iraq, but 
better yet, they're down there with the President. All I'm saying is 
that all of the groups, some, was it 270 and counting, are saying that 
we want health care for children.

And all of the Members, I want to the make sure I say it right, a 
number of Republicans in the Senate that voted for this measure, and 
over here in the House?
