Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the 2010 Department 
of Defense Appropriations Act. This bill provides $636.3 billion to 
fund the defense, military family support, humanitarian assistance and 
oversight priorities of the American people.

This bill provides the resources to implement President Obama's 
national security strategy, including the new approach he is taking 
with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill also provides funding to 
support the general quality-of-life needs of our troops and their 
families. Specifically, the measure provides a 3.4 percent pay increase 
for military personnel; $8.3 million in additional funds to compensate 
personnel subject to ''stop loss'' requirements; and $2.6 billion to 
support military families--including $472 million for family advocacy 
programs that help children and families manage the many challenges of 
military service.

The bill also provides $29.9 billion for the defense health program, 
including $500 million for traumatic brain injury treatments and funds 
to treat Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome. And finally, the Defense 
Appropriations Act includes a number of provisions to improve oversight 
of defense contractors and $110 million for international humanitarian 
assistance including foreign disaster and emergency relief assistance.
