`Mr. PAULSEN â€” 23 September 2009`

Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, just in closing, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. This is a good, bipartisan bill. It was crafted by 
Senators Dodd and Shelby in consultation with Mr. Watt and Mr. Bachus. 
It passed the Senate last week under unanimous consent.

Although we're in the middle of hurricane season and in a tough 
conflict in Afghanistan, these powers will expire at midnight 1 week 
from today if we do not reauthorize them. So I hope that all Members 
will support this legislation and send it to the President quickly so 
he can sign it.

I yield back the balance of my time.
