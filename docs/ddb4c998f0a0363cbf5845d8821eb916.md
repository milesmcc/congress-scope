Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2/1/2/ minutes.

We need to change course in Iraq. That is why I support the 
supplemental bill now before the Senate and oppose the Cochran 
amendment that is pending. This underlying bill finally sets a new 
direction for our mission in Iraq. It begins to redeploy our troops, 
and it helps us refocus our efforts on fighting and winning the war on 
terror.

Mr. President, our troops have done everything we have asked them to 
do. Now it is time to start bringing them


home. It is time for the Iraqi people and for the Iraqi Government to 
take responsibility for their own country. We should not be sending 
more and more Americans into the middle of a civil war. The conflict in 
Iraq is not going to be solved by military force alone. It is going to 
require a political solution among Iraqis. So this underlying bill sets 
benchmarks for the Iraqi Government on the types of progress that we 
all agree they ought to be making. They should not be stricken from 
this by the Cochran amendment.

The President wants to commit more American servicemembers to an 
open-ended conflict. This bill recognizes that we need a new strategy. 
We need to do what the Iraqi Study Group and what many generals and 
what the American people have called for. We need to redeploy our 
troops. The bill says a redeployment should begin within 120 days, and 
it sets the goal of having most U.S. forces out of Iraq by next March.

Importantly, this bill helps us take care of those who are injured 
fighting for our country. It is time we focused our attention on those 
men and women who have sacrificed so much, who have come home and have 
endured the hardship we have seen at Walter Reed and other facilities 
across this country. We need to make sure they get the resources they 
need, and this bill does that.

I am pleased to support the underlying bill. I oppose the Cochran 
amendment, and I support this bill because it sets a new direction for 
our policy in Iraq and it provides important new support for our 
servicemembers and veterans who are here at home.

I retain the remainder of our time.
