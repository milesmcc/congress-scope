Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor those who wear the uniform 
and serve their Nation in the U.S. armed services. We have more than 
1.3 million active duty troops stationed throughout the world, and we 
owe these men and women much for their dedication and service. As a 
Naval Reserve intelligence officer who just returned from 2 weeks of 
active duty in August, I would also like to thank those who serve in 
our military's Reserve forces. More than 800,000 Americans serve in the 
seven Reserve branches, including the Army National Guard, Army 
Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air National Guard, Air 
Force Reserve and Coast Guard Reserve.

Several weeks ago, I learned of one individual in my district that 
demonstrates the strong commitment to community and country that every 
Reserve enlisted person and officer has.

Tom Baier resides in Libertyville, IL, where the 53-year-old doctor 
has an orthopedic surgery practice. He serves as a team physician for 
several local youth sports teams, as well as a teacher for other 
doctors for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction surgery.

Dr. Baier's son Mike enlisted in the Marine Corps last spring and is 
currently stationed in Iraq. In part because of his son's service and 
his specialized surgical knowledge, Dr. Baier joined the Army Reserve's 
medical corps. On August 9, he was commissioned as a major and will 
report for training in the coming months.

Like many serving in our Reserve forces, Dr. Baier brings with him an 
expertise that will be an incredible asset to our military. Our men and 
women in the military deserve nothing but the finest medical care 
possible and I am grateful that we have individuals like Dr. Baier to 
provide that care. For all the men and women serving in the 10th 
Congressional District, from active duty to Reserve, as well as their 
families, we are honored by your sacrifices and selfless dedication to 
the Nation. We are a stronger country because of individuals like Dr. 
Baier.
