Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to say on behalf of the people I 
represent that we, too, send our condolences to the family of the 
soldier who was lost. My State has suffered many losses in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and we understand the extraordinary sacrifice these 
families make. We wish to say to the people of New Hampshire, and 
especially the family of the soldier, that our thoughts and prayers are 
with them as well.
