Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, more than 8 years after the September 11 
attacks, our country is still fighting against terrorism. The attempted 
attack on Christmas Day has renewed the discussion of how to keep our 
country and its citizens safe and our Nation's interests protected. Our 
military is fighting every day to protect the world from these 
extremists.

Arkansans have proudly served to defend our country since the global 
war on terror began. Most recently, last week, 50 members of the 188th 
Fighter Wing, based in Fort Smith, Arkansas, left for a 120-day 
deployment in Afghanistan. These men and women are continuing the 
Arkansas tradition of service to our Nation. In the coming months, an 
additional 250 members of the 188th will deploy to provide close air 
support for ground troops in Afghanistan. This is an important mission 
that I am confident these men and women will accomplish successfully.

I ask my colleagues to keep the members of the 188th and their 
families and friends in their thoughts and prayers during this time.
