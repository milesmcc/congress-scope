Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I personally thank the Senator from 
Florida for a fine statement. I listened very carefully to what he had 
to say on FISA, and then his message of hope to the Iraqi people. I 
have had an opportunity to serve with the Senator from Florida in the 
Senate and I feel very honored to be able to do that. I also had an 
opportunity to interact with him when he was a member of the 
President's Cabinet. He is a leader whom I think has a future and I 
certainly appreciate his leadership here in the Senate as well as in 
the President's Cabinet. I thank him for his dedication to our country.
