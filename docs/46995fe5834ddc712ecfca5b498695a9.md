Mr. KUCINICH. There are some numbers that bear reflection right now 
that came out of the marketwatch.com report today that the Labor 
Department estimates 3.3 million people could lose extended 
unemployment benefits by the end of July if they're not renewed. And 
all together, 9.2 million people were collecting some type of 
unemployment benefits in the weekend of June 12.

It goes on to say that the 4-week average of initial claims rose by 
3,250, to 466,500, the highest level in almost 3 months. And then it 
says the claims data, however, had little impact on the U.S. stock 
market.

So there's a separation between Wall Street, which is still doing 
well, because the taxpayers bailed out Wall Street, and Main Street, 
which, in many places across the country, is falling apart.

Now, I've traveled my district at countless meetings and events, 
parades and church services, festivals; and I hear the same thing. 
People are calling out from crowds asking for help. And this 
unemployment compensation issue is huge because people are having 
trouble putting food on the table.

We're going to give them a lecture about the budget? Who among us, if 
our brother asks for a loaf of bread, we give him a stone instead?

This Congress this afternoon is due to appropriate $33 billion to 
keep the war in Afghanistan going. And yet the amount of money we're 
asking here for the unemployed workers of America, for those who are 
trying to support their families, almost an identical amount, about $34 
billion. And we're saying, well, we can't afford that. But you don't 
hear many people saying we can't afford the war, because the truth is 
we can't afford the war. We have to afford to put people back to 
economic sustenance and pass the unemployment compensation bill.
