`Mr. BIDEN â€” 17 January 2007`

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, Senator Hagel, Senator Levin, and I 
are submitting a bipartisan resolution that opposes the President's 
plan to escalate the war in Iraq.

This resolution says what we and many of our colleagues, Democrats 
and Republicans, are against: deepening America's military involvement 
in Iraq by escalating our troop presence.

Just as important, it says what we and many of our colleagues are 
for: a strategy that can produce a political settlement in Iraq.

That's the only way to stop Shiites and Sunnis from killing each 
other and allow our troops to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.

Last week, when Secretary of State Rice presented the President's 
plan to escalate our troop presence in Iraq to the Foreign Relations 
Committee, the reaction from Democrats and Republicans alike ranged 
from profound skepticism to outright opposition.

This resolution will give every Senator a chance to say where he or 
she stands on the President's plan.

I believe that when a President goes way off course on something as 
important as Iraq, the single most effective way to get him to change 
course is to demonstrate that his policy has waning or no support--from 
both parties.

The more we make Iraq a partisan issue, the more the President is 
likely to dig in. The more we show that Americans across the board 
don't want to go down the path of escalation, the better our chance to 
stop it.

Iraq is not a partisan issue. It's a challenge we must meet as 
Americans.

The very first sentence of our resolution says something the three of 
us believe profoundly: ''U.S. strategy and presence on the ground in 
Iraq can only be sustained with the support of the American people and 
the bipartisan support of Congress.''

This resolution will demonstrate that, right now, the support is not 
there for the President's policy in Iraq. The sooner he recognizes that 
reality and acts on it, the better off all of us will be.
