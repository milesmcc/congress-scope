Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the 
majority party's Iraq supplemental appropriations bill. I returned from 
Iraq last week where I met with our troops. The one question I was 
asked repeatedly was, ''Why doesn't Congress support us?'' I told them 
that I do support them. Unfortunately, this bill does not.

Right now, we have the A-Team in Iraq and they are producing results. 
I saw it firsthand:

Sunnis working with Shia and the United States Marine Corps in the 
al-Anbar province.

Sunnis looking forward to the next elections.

An oil distribution plan that is on the brink of completion.

The majority supplemental bill is simply defeat on the installment 
plan. How can Congress convey our support for the troops in Iraq and at 
the same time pass a bill which pulls the rug from the very people we 
claim to support? Plain and simple, this supplemental as written by the 
majority is a blueprint for defeat.

I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and pass a clean 
supplemental bill that provides support to those who are fighting and 
dying. We owe them that much.
