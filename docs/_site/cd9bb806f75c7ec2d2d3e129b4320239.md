`Mr. ROSS â€” 15 May 2007`

Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his 
work with the Blue Dog Coalition, 43 of us, fiscally conservative 
Democrats. I welcome the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, to remain 
on the floor with me, if time will permit for him, for a discussion 
more in depth over the next 40 minutes as we talk about restoring not 
only fiscal sanity, but also accountability to our government, not only 
here at home but to the money being spent in Iraq.

We all support our troops, Democrats and Republicans alike. Up until 
now,


the President would have you believe that we are sending $12 million an 
hour to Iraq, and if you question how any of it is being spent, he 
would tell you you are unpatriotic.

Well, the Blue Dogs have said enough is enough. It is time to demand 
accountability for how that money is being spent, to ensure it is being 
spent to provide the very best equipment and the best of the best for 
our brave men and women in uniform serving us abroad today, not only in 
Iraq but also Afghanistan.

I am joined this evening by the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Earl 
Pomeroy, and a fellow Blue Dog member. Welcome.
