Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, I rise with great respect for Mr. Skelton, 
but I did want to express my real hesitation and my real concern over 
what is occurring.

When I have gone and sat through this with lawyers, a lien is not a 
hold, and we are actually not freezing these assets. My concern is 
this, that here men and women who have worn the cloth of this Nation 
and have actually been tortured, successfully won a judgment, are now 
precluded by a President because the Iraqi Government, to whom we are 
providing $12 billion a month in terms of our natural resources, has 
threatened to pull out of the United States' trillion dollars of 
markets $25 billion. I don't think this is right.

There are a lot of good things in this bill that need to pass, the 
pay raise to the readiness. But I honestly believe the President has 
not taken care of those who sacrificed the most for this Nation, and I 
would like us to look upon ourselves as to what we are doing here 
today.
