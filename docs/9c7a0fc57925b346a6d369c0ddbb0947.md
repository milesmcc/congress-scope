Mr. POE of Texas. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, we sometimes forget how great an ally Poland is to the 
United States. They have not only had a quest for freedom for their own 
people, but they have been an ally to this Nation. As the United States 
and other NATO countries are engaged in the battle against terrorism in 
Afghanistan, there are over 2,000 members of the Polish military who 
are there as well, side by side with the United States and with other 
NATO forces, the freedom fighters that they are, helping to seek 
freedom and liberty in Afghanistan and against those international 
terrorists who do us all harm.

I think Mr. Pascrell, the gentleman from New Jersey, said it well 
today. ''We are all Poles,'' and we honor them, and we suffer their 
loss and their grief at this time because of the tragedy that occurred 
not only on Saturday but at the massacre that occurred in that forest 
in the Soviet Union many, many years ago.

I yield back the balance of my time.
