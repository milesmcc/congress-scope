Mr. KINGSTON. I want to read you this statement by the Speaker of the 
House, third in line for the President, March 19. This is Nancy Pelosi 
talking, ''When we do this, when we transition, when we change the 
mission, when we redeploy the troops, build political consensus, engage 
in diplomatic efforts and reform and reinvigorate the reconstruction 
effort, then we can turn our attention to the real war on terror in 
Afghanistan. I hear the voice of the future in the Chamber. What a 
beautiful sound. What a beautiful sound.''

Now, I guess that qualifies you to micromanage the war in Iraq 
because you have acknowledged there is no terrorism in Iraq, that it's 
all in Afghanistan. I guess if the real war is in Afghanistan, then the 
fake war is in Iraq. Therefore, it's okay, at the hands of the troop.
