Mr. ISSA. Reclaiming my time, I might note that under our PAYGO 
rules, the bill that will come before the floor will even be less than 
that. It has been reduced below the mark that was set and passed 96-1 
in the Senate in order to maintain a balance under PAYGO.

So the gentleman is absolutely right. This represents one or two days 
of the cost of what we're doing for our future veterans in Iraq and 
Afghanistan and, in fact, should not be controversial. And I hope when 
it comes to the floor on a bipartisan basis, it clearly shouldn't and 
wouldn't be controversial.

I reserve my time.
