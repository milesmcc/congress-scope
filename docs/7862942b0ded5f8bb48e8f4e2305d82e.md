Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding.

Let me just say very quickly that obviously I'm very sympathetic with 
the concern and I argue that the revelation of this WikiLeaks, you 
know, thousands and thousands of documents that came forward, is 
evidence that we need to work to continue to build the democratic 
institutions and greater economic opportunity and civilian control.

Now it is no secret over the past several decades the relationship 
between the ISI and problems in Afghanistan; everyone has been aware of 
that. These documents have underscored the importance of it, but I 
would argue, Mr. Speaker, that it is essential for us to make sure we 
build up greater civilian control, and I think that's what we are 
trying to do.
