`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 24 September 2007`

Mr. LIEBERMAN. The war Iran is fighting against American troops and 
our allies in Iraq is an undeclared war, but it is, nonetheless, a real 
war in which real Americans and Iraqis are being murdered by Iranian 
agents. We cannot close our eyes to that outrageous reality. This 
amendment exposes that behavior and demands justice.

As we speak, the President of Iran is in the United States. There is 
no better time than that for us to stand together, united as Americans, 
regardless of our position on Iraq or our party affiliation, and send a 
crystal clear message to Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad and the fanatical 
terrorists and tyrants who now run the great country of Iran and 
oppress its people that their campaign of terror against our troops in 
Iraq must end and we will stand united as Americans against it. Ahmadi-
Nejad should not be given any American platform to speak from until he 
acts to stop his government's killing of Americans. They have been 
shouting for almost three decades ''death to America.'' He leads those 
chants of tens of thousands in Iran today. But they have done more than 
shout; they have acted to bring that death to Americans in the marine 
barracks in Beirut, Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and today in Iraq.

Giving this evil and fanatical man a platform at a great American 
university is an insult to the hundreds of Americans whose blood he and 
his extremist allies in Iran have on their hands. He deserves no 
audience, no respect, no opportunity to explain away his hateful words 
and murderous actions. He and the ruling clique in Iran deserve the 
punishment, and more, this amendment Senator Kyl and I are introducing 
would impose on them as the terrorists they are.

I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.
