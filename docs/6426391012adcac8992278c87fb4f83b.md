Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday tens of thousands of 
protesters protested on the National Mall the war on Iraq, and in 
particular, the 21,500 troop surge. These Americans exercised their 
first amendment right, and indeed, I am grateful to live in a Nation 
where we can protest government policies. However, my colleagues, I 
read in The Hill newspaper one troubling incident that arose. It says, 
300 self-described anarchists spray-painted symbols and slogans on the 
west front steps of the United States Capitol building.

More puzzling, the article says that helpless Capitol Police officers 
watched, reporting that they were ordered to avoid confronting the 
group. It seems U.S. Capitol Police Chief Phillip Morse defends that 
the graffiti was ''easily removed'' and, most significantly, the 
building was secure from the artists' entry.

I am not sure I agree with such dismissiveness. Protected free speech 
does not include vandalism. I ask the Speaker to investigate. 
Peacefully assembling to protest is permissible, defacing public 
property is unacceptable and it should not happen again.
