Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, today the House of 
Representatives will debate an emergency supplemental spending bill 
meant to provide needed resources to our military. It should only 
provide money for the brave men and women fighting terrorists in Iraq 
and Afghanistan to protect American families at home. It is, therefore, 
disappointing that the supplemental bill crafted by the Democratic 
leadership contains billions of dollars in nonemergency spending.

While there may be components of the bill that should be debated, 
this is not the time and certainly not the bill to be having those 
debates while our


troops are desperately in need of additional funding.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates and our military leadership have told 
Congress that the money is vital to ensuring our troops have the 
resources they require to defeat terrorists overseas. Including 
billions of dollars in unrelated spending is a dangerous impediment. I 
hope my colleagues will instead support the clean supplemental bill 
introduced by Representative Jerry Lewis of California.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
