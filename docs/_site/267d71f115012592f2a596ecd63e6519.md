Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Madam Speaker, I believe that the statements made 
earlier by our good friend from North Carolina was right to the point. 
Unilateralism was our policy. We told the world, We don't need you. And 
what are we doing now? We are practically begging the world to come and 
help us with this mess that we created.

Diplomacy? Look at the success of the multilateralism that we have 
now advocated in our dealings with North Korea. But that was not the 
case with Iraq, and this is why we are having this problem.

Madam Speaker, I gladly yield 5 minutes to my good friend, the 
gentleman from Missouri, who currently chairs the Subcommittee on 
Information and Policy, and I am very, very happy to introduce the 
gentleman for 5 minutes (Mr. Clay).
