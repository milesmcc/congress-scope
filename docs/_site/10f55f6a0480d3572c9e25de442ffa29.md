# EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `10f55f6a0480d3572c9e25de442ffa29`
`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 5 February 2007`

Mr. LIEBERMAN. When we send a message of irresolution, it does not 
support our troops. When we renounce their mission, it does not support 
our troops. We heard recently in the Senate Armed Services Committee 
from GEN Jack Keane, a former chief of staff of the U.S. Army, who said 
of a resolution like this one:




 It's just not helpful . . . What the enemy sees is an 


 erosion of the political and moral will of the American 


 people . . .



 Our soldiers are Americans first. They clearly understand 


 there's a political process in this country that they clearly 


 support . . . But at the end of the day, they are going to go 


 out and do a tough mission, and I certainly would like to see 


 them supported in that mission as opposed to declaring 


 nonsupport. . . .


I agree. Everyone here knows the American people are frustrated about 
the lack of progress in Iraq. Everyone here shares that frustration. 
And as elected representatives of the people, everyone here feels 
pressure to give expression to that frustration. This is not a new 
challenge. It is one that every democracy in every long war has had to 
confront. Nearly a century and a half ago, an American President 
wrestled with just this problem. It was in the midst of a terrible war, 
a civil war in which hundreds of thousands of Americans were fighting 
and dying to secure the freedom of millions long and cruelly denied it.

''We here highly resolve,'' that was Lincoln's message at Gettysburg. 
It was a message of resolution.

I ask unanimous consent for an additional moment from the time of 
Senator McConnell to finish the statement.
