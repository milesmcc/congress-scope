Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, this week Congress takes up its obligation 
to finally change course in Iraq. This week as we enter the fifth year 
of the Iraq war, more than 3,200 American lives have been lost, tens of 
thousands more are wounded, and sectarian violence threatens to spill 
over into the entire Middle East with no prospect for a stable, 
constitutional democracy in Iraq in sight. We must judge this war not 
for what we wish it were, but for what it has so clearly and tragically 
become, a mistake of historic proportions.

I believe America should be sending a clear signal by beginning to 
reduce our troop levels now so the Iraqi Government takes 
responsibility and diplomacy can begin for real. I support phased 
redeployment over the next year and will seek every opportunity to 
mandate such change in law. Let us serve our men and women fighting 
overseas and recognize their sacrifices by charting a new course in 
Iraq.

By voting for this supplemental appropriations bill, we vote for 
accountability in Iraq. We vote to force a change in policy and in law, 
requiring a phased, responsible redeployment of our troops over 12 to 
18 months. There are too many lives at stake here, and, personally, I 
have crossed the Rubicon on this war.

Regardless of whether this bill is blocked by a filibuster from 
Senate Republicans or a threatened veto from President Bush, we must 
support this bill today. Passing this bill in the House will be the 
first formal act, the first step toward requiring a new course in Iraq. 
We all know our troops will do anything their country asks. But let us 
make sure their courage and their sacrifices advance a mission that 
enhances our security and our interests.

We need to begin reducing our troops and pursuing a new strategy in 
order to achieve a stable Iraq, a peaceful Middle East, and a more 
secure America.

That is our obligation. Let us honor it by voting in favor of this 
supplemental bill.
