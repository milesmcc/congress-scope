Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, instead of working together like President 
Reagan and Speaker O'Neill did in the early eighties to extend the 
solvency of Social Security, this week the Republican leader announced 
his plan to raise the Social Security retirement age and decrease 
benefits for older Americans to pay for the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on the backs of 
seniors? You've got to be kidding me.

This is the same Republican Party when, in the majority under 
President Bush, refused to pay for the two wars, and gave tax cuts to 
the wealthiest Americans, doubling our national debt, and laying the 
groundwork for the worst financial crisis in a generation.

And some Republicans are still trying to privatize Social Security. 
Do I need to remind people that personal retirement funds have been 
wiped out under failed Republican economics?

The other side refuses to work together to create additional jobs and 
to help those who have lost their jobs.

Despite Republican foot dragging and nay-saying, this year we're on 
track to create more jobs than were created during the entire 8 years 
under President Bush.

Missourians simply cannot afford more failed economic policies.
