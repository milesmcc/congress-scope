Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Upholding our international treaty obligations 
not to absolve sponsors of terrorism and deterring other countries from 
engaging in the same type of state-sponsored terrorism that Iraq 
engaged in should be the message that this legislation sends.

This is a bipartisan agreement. We want to work with the 
administration to see that these deserving heroes finally get the 
justice they deserve after 17 years.
