`Mr. REID â€” 21 October 2009`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the prayer of the Chaplain today was right 
on point for something that has taken place in the last 3 or 4 days. In 
Afghanistan, we are at a critical juncture. For Afghanistan to move 
forward and win the fight against the Taliban, the country must have a 
legitimate government.

The first round of elections in Afghanistan was tainted by 
allegations of significant fraud, and we faced the possibility of a 
potential political crisis in Afghanistan. I am pleased President 
Karzai has recognized the need for a runoff election.

The reason I mention sacrifice and service is in relation to Senator 
John Kerry. If you look at his life, it has been one of sacrifice, it 
has been one of service to our country--whether in the jungles of 
Vietnam, where he was wounded three times and received a Silver Star 
for his heroism, or whether it was in his capacity as the Democratic 
nominee for President or whether it has been as chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Committee.

He took off for Afghanistan and Pakistan at a time when he was badly 
needed. I missed him here. We had some votes I wish John Kerry could 
have been here for. I told him that when he called me. But he explained 
what he was doing there, and immediately upon his hanging up, I 
received a call from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, saying: He is 
doing extremely good work there. Don't be upset at him because he can't 
be here because what he is doing in Afghanistan is something that is 
vitally important to not only our country but to the world.

That sacrifice and that service--and also the Chaplain mentioned 
labor--this man worked very hard. He has labored, as chairman of this 
Foreign Relations Committee, as I have never seen. He has been so 
involved in what is going on there. Not only is he dealing with the 
issues we see every day--


Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea, with what is going on on the 
continent of Africa--he is involved in global warming because of the 
treaty implications of the treaty we are trying to negotiate in 
Copenhagen in December.

I am extremely impressed with Senator Kerry always but especially in 
the last few days. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he 
has played a central role in resolving the crisis in Afghanistan.

As many have read in the news, he had been trying to persuade 
President Karzai that a second round of elections was necessary--and 
they were necessary. If you read the press today, it was a touch-and-go 
thing. It was not until President Karzai and Senator Kerry took a walk 
together to talk about what is going on in that part of the world that 
the decision was made by President Karzai that he would go along with 
the second election.

Senator Kerry has worked closely with our diplomatic team, including 
Ambassador Eikenberry; Secretary Clinton; our National Security 
Adviser, General Jones; and others to send a clear message to President 
Karzai.

We all know the situation in Afghanistan remains fragile and that 
there will still be many steps needed to be taken so we have a credible 
and legitimate government in Kabul. But I believe very sincerely 
Senator Kerry played a pivotal role in preventing a crisis in 
Afghanistan and that his work has not only stabilized Afghanistan but 
the entire region.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.
