Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this vote and the debate that we are 
having is about politics and providing some political cover. It does 
nothing to help our soldiers win.

Remember, it is a nonbinding resolution. What does that mean? It 
means that we could talk, as my mother used to say, until the cows come 
home. It has absolutely no effect. It has no power, no teeth and 
absolutely no effect.

To be more specific, there is not one single mention in the Democrat 
resolution of how we will send more body armor for the troops, not a 
single mention of new tools to detect IED explosives, not one word 
dedicated to up-armored Humvees.

Mr. Speaker, there is not one mention of the method to fund the 
health care needs of the veterans who come home. Not one mention. And 
this is important to remember: It has absolutely no mention of sending 
one soldier, let alone the 20,000 additional who are going over there 
or our fine young men and women who are already there, when they are 
going to come home one day sooner.

In my district, Floridians have seen through this nonbinding 
resolution. The headline of the Orlando Sentinel calls it an ''empty 
measure.'' It says, ''The pointless House resolution on Iraq fails to 
set goals.'' The editorial goes on to say that the resolution ''isn't 
thoughtful policy; it's political cover.'' It is not just me saying it. 
This is certainly not a conservative newspaper, the Orlando Sentinel.

My constituents know over the past few days we have debated a 
resolution with no teeth, no enforcement, delivered in a way that has 
no guts, no character and provides no leadership.

Need to hear more? The Veterans of Foreign Wars said that, ''Other 
generations have learned the hard way when military decisions are 
second-guessed by opinion polls or overruled by politicians.''

The VFW and the American Legion know what happens when politicians 
play politics with war. Our veterans' message to Democrats is to 
support the surge and give our soldiers a chance to win. That is really 
what they want. They want to win.

In closing, I must echo the American Legion and the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars with the words that ring in the hearts of veterans 
everywhere: Give our sons and daughters in this fight the chance to 
win. That, Mr. Speaker, is exactly what they are asking for.
