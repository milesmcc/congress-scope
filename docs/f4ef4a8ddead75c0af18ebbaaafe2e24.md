`Mr. LaTOURETTE â€” 3 October 2008`

Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

There is something in life called the Hobson's choice. And I never 
thought I would be here, and I think Dave Hobson who is retiring 
probably thinks it is named after him, but it is not. And what we are 
being told today is that we either give $700 billion to the Secretary 
of the Treasury because he says that is what is needed, in a plan that 
is untested, unworked; or, and if we don't just write this check, we 
are being told that all of our constituents are going to lose their 
life savings, their 401(k)s, their retirements. That is one hell of a 
choice, Madam Speaker.

And I come today with a big problem. The big problem is, where did 
the number come from? The number, Forbes Magazine last week, Treasury 
spokeswoman: It is not based on any data point. We just wanted to 
choose a really large number. Well, you know what: $700 billion is a 
really large number.

Last night we took an amendment to the Rules Committee, asked them to 
make it in order to stop this process, slow it down by a day. The vote 
was 8-4, along party lines. Eight Democratic members of the Rules 
Committee, who represent about 4.8 million people, told 305 million 
Americans we couldn't have a vote on that or anything else, including 
measures that are important to Democrats, such as bankruptcy and things 
of that nature.

This bill left the House and it went over to the Senate, and they 
larded it up: $192 million for rum. I guess we got the pirate vote in 
November. $100 million for NASCAR. $81 million for Hollywood. And my 
favorite, $2 million for wooden arrows for children. Now, I want 
children to have wooden arrows, but it doesn't belong in this bill.

And I have got to tell you, as a Republican I have never seen--I am 
finishing my 14th year--what just happened on the last vote. And we all 
know that folks back home don't pay attention to the rules. Twenty 
Republicans voted for the Democratic rule. If those 20 Republicans had 
not voted for that rule, we could have had an amendment on the floor, 
saving America $450 billion, which, as our friends like to tell us, is 
4 years in Iraq, and we could have cut the pork.

As John McCain says, and sadly, for those 20 Republicans and those 
who aided and abetted them: we will make you famous, and you shall know 
their names. Shame on you.
