Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. One of the things that we face every year is 
something called an emergency supplemental, which is a request from the 
President for billions of dollars of additional funding to fund the 
ongoing war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Now, I would just ask my colleagues, and I'll pose this first to you, 
Mr. Hall. Where I come from in Iowa, an emergency is something that is 
unexpected and unanticipated that you can't plan for. But I am at a 
loss to understand why, after being in Iraq longer than we were engaged 
in the Civil War, after being in Iraq longer than we were engaged in 
World War II, we continue to face emergency supplemental funding 
requests for these wars, when the Department of Defense and the 
Pentagon and the President have to know how much they anticipate when 
they send their budget down for us to consider.
