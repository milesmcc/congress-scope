Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the gentleman. And as the gentleman has said, 
he has been to Walter Reed with his wife; I have, also. And I think 
about one time I went and I was there with a soldier that had gotten a 
new prosthesis. He had lost part of his leg. And he said he was so 
proud of it. He said, Congressman, this is state-of-the-art, and I'm 
going to be able to walk again, and do you know what I want to do? I 
said, what do you want to do? He said, I want to go back and be with my 
buddies and finish the job that I went to do.

Those are the kind of men and women that I'm going to be celebrating 
during this Memorial Day weekend.

I am proud to see that a great Member of Congress from Iowa, the 
gentleman from Iowa Mr. King, who I know has been to Iraq on a number 
of occasions, and I am pleased that he has joined us this evening and 
would yield to the gentleman.
