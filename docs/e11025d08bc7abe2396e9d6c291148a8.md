Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I have consistently voted against 
funding for this ill-conceived and miserably run war, but I reluctantly 
support this additional funding because it will require the beginning 
of a withdrawal from Iraq. It also contains important provisions to 
prevent torture and ensure that our troops are fully equipped and 
trained.

Because President Bush has done nothing to earn the trust of Congress 
or the American people, this funding is only for a few months, giving 
Congress the chance to exercise oversight and hold the President 
accountable to ensure that the withdrawal is actually occurring at a 
responsible pace.

With a veto likely, we must tell the President that Congress will not 
provide this $50 billion, and certainly not the entire $200 billion 
he's asked for, as a blank check. But I am pleased that, in this 
legislation, Congress is saying that we will only fund an end to this 
war, not its continuation. Bringing this nightmare to a quick and 
responsible close is my highest priority.
