`Mr. GINGREY of Georgia â€” 11 June 2009`

---


Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this week the residents of a 
small town in Georgia's 11th Congressional District are grieving 
together as they say goodbye to a native son who died while bravely 
serving his Nation in Afghanistan.

Sergeant Jeffrey W. Jordan was killed in action on June 4, 2009, near 
Kapisa, Afghanistan, of wounds suffered from an improvised explosive 
device and small arms fire.

Jeffrey was born and raised in Floyd County and, after high school, 
he settled in a very close-knit town of Cave Springs, Georgia, with his 
wife, Lacey, and his son, Tailor. Tragically, the Jordan family marked 
Tailor's first birthday on the very same day his father gave his life 
in defense of our Nation.

Jeffrey is remembered as a loving husband, father, son, brother, 
grandson, friend and patriot whose sacrifice for our Nation will never 
be forgotten.

Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Jordan leaves behind his wife, Lacey Lambert 
Jordan, his son, Tailor Jordan; his parents, Mary Lou and Tracy Lorin 
Dowdy; his brothers, Robert Jordan and J.R. Thomason; a sister, Candice 
Dials; and his grandparents, C.W. and Barbara White, and Mrs. Delores 
Thomason and Mrs. Delane Ingram; also a great-grandmother, Mrs. Ruth 
Wilson, as well as so many aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews and 
in-laws. Tomorrow, I will join this group of Sergeant Jordan's family, 
friends and supporters at his funeral to honor the life of this brave 
soldier.

Mr. Speaker, my prayers go out to his family, and my deepest 
gratitude goes out to Sergeant Jordan for his selfless sacrifice, yes, 
for our Nation.

I ask all Members, please join me in honoring the distinguished 
memory of Sergeant Jeffrey W. Jordan.
