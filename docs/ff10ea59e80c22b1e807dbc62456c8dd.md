`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 3 April 2008`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I have been aware of it because we have listened 
to our good leaders, including yourself, Senator Durbin, Senator 
Schumer, and Senator Dodd, talking about between 8,000 and 12,000.

I had a chance to be out in Youngstown, OH, recently. Five-thousand 
homes are empty there, and it is increasing every single day just in 
that one community. That is being replicated in my State. People are 
saying:


Where is the action? Where is the leadership? When are you going to do 
something on this issue? We are interested in getting something done.

Mr. Bernanke was asked, after he became Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve: How are things going in terms of our economy? ''Fine,'' he 
said. He never exercised the bully pulpit to stop the explosiveness 
that is taking place in the housing market and put so many homeowners 
at risk.

This is as bad as Katrina and as bad as the Iraq war. We have a 
similar response from the administration, and that is a failure of 
leadership and a failure of action. The American people ought to 
understand that.
