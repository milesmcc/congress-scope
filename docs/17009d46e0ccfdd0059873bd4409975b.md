Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, for almost 4 years the 
administration has been saying, just give us more time, just give us 
more money, our plan will bring peace. And now they are saying, we need 
more troops, 48,000 of them. But we have already had four troop 
increases since we went into Iraq and none of them have brought 
stability.

Tragically, this war has cost more than 3,100 American lives, 143 
from my home State of New York, and thousands of Iraqi lives, as well 
as more than 20,000 injured American soldiers who will carry their 
wounds for the rest of their lives.

The bipartisan Hamilton-Baker Commission called for a different 
approach. They said: ''The situation in Iraq is grave and 
deteriorating.'' As Mr. Hamilton said: ''The current approach is not 
working. And the ability of the U.S. to influence events is 
diminishing.''

The commission called for greater use of diplomacy. And the 
commission's report stated clearly that we must not make an open-ended 
commitment to keep large numbers of American troops in Iraq. They 
warned that doing so would continue to stretch our troops too thin, 
hampering our abilities to simultaneously face other threats in the 
world.

It would severely affect America's army readiness, and it would not 
give the Iraqi Government the incentive needed to help bring security. 
If this assessment is so clearly in opposition to a long-term 
deployment in Iraq, why is the administration doing the exact opposite?

They are calling for a bigger commitment of troops, for more 
expenditure of lives and treasure with no end in sight. They speak of 
victory, but what is victory? Was it finding weapons of mass 
destruction? There were none. Was it a nuclear weapons program? There 
was not one. Was Iraq an imminent threat to our security? We were told 
it was, but in fact it was not.

They claimed that they would exhaust all options before taking 
military action. But they did not even wait for the weapons inspectors' 
final report. Was our goal to impose democracy on the entire Middle 
East? The war has inflamed and destabilized the region. Whatever their 
justification, they have embarked on a policy that is dragging America 
into the mire of another country's civil war.

In this civil war we don't know who's shooting. We just know that all 
sides are shooting at us. We also now know that there was no al Qaeda 
connection in Iraq before we invaded. The Pentagon's Inspector General 
has reported that Douglas Feith, the Pentagon's Under Secretary, cooked 
intelligence reports to make a case to go to war based on al Qaeda. It 
is tragically ironic that now by invading we have actually made Iraq 
fertile territory for al Qaeda recruitment.

Madam Speaker, on top of their rush to war and their insufficient 
planning, their mismanagement is legendary. They initially estimated 
that the war would cost 50 to $60 billion. But by the end of this year, 
Congress will have spent about half a trillion dollars, ten times the 
original estimate.

Last week, we had a hearing on $12 billion that was airlifted into 
the war zone and now $8.8 billion is unaccounted for, completely 
missing. Madam Speaker, how much mismanagement and misdirection can 
this country tolerate?

In November, Americans voted for a new direction for the war, a new 
direction for Congress. I rise in support of this new direction and 
against this escalation in Iraq.
