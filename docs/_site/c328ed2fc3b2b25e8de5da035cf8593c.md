Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from New 
Hampshire, I can't think of anything more relevant to an Iraq debate 
about the appropriateness of this new mission, which General Petraeus 
will lead, than the amendment which Senator Gregg has authored and 
which we request be our proposal as this debate goes forward.
