Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, the Justice and Victims of Torture and Terrorism Act, 
introduced by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley) and the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak), will enable American POWs and civilians 
to hold the Government of Iraq liable for the physical and emotional 
injuries they sustained while held captive by Iraqi officials during 
the Gulf War.

During the Persian Gulf War, American pilots captured by Iraq were 
brutalized in horrendous ways. They were starved, exposed to extreme 
temperatures, severely beaten, and subjected to mock executions.

Because Iraq believed that these pilots had more sensitive 
information, they were subjected to especially brutal treatment. They 
sustained long-lasting physical and emotional injuries.

American civilians who had the misfortune of being held in Iraq at 
the time it invaded Kuwait were held hostage as ''human shields,'' used 
as leverage to interfere with the campaign to liberate Kuwait and 
defeat the Iraqi forces. These civilians were held in cruel and 
degrading conditions and forced to live in constant fear.

While Congress has supported giving terrorism victims the right to 
obtain effective relief, the executive branch has allowed State 
Department sensitivities to overshadow the fundamental rights of these 
victims to fair redress.

In amending the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in 1996, Congress 
intended to create a Federal statutory cause of action for American 
victims of terrorism, so that they could hold foreign States that 
commit or provide material support for terrorist acts accountable in 
United States courts.

Congress reaffirmed that intent last December in the National Defense 
Authorization Act. Unfortunately, the President vetoed the bill on that 
basis and insisted that the Congress give him waiver authority for 
Iraq, which he promptly exercised, once again placing relief out of 
reach for these victims.

In its introduced form, the bill simply rescinded that waiver 
authority. It has now been amended, with the assistance of the 
sponsors, as well as the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), working 
with the victims and their families.

The bill we are considering today would give the Iraqi Government 90 
days after enactment to satisfactorily settle the claims of American 
victims to prevent the waiver authority from being rescinded.

The waiver authority would also survive if the President certifies 
that Iraq has no settlement claims of non-Americans that are similar to 
the claims of the POWs and human shields and has not settled commercial 
debts to foreign corporations.

The amended bill also specifies limits on the damage awards, to 
remove any argument about potentially open-ended liability. The 
specified amounts are a fraction of the outstanding judgment awards and 
pending claims.

Under this proposal, the Iraqi Government would be required to pay 
approximately $415 million. The amount of recovery sought is de minimis 
relative to the 20 to $32 billion in commercial claims that Iraq has 
reportedly settled with the corporations in Japan and Korea. It also 
amounts to perhaps 1 percent of the Iraqi Government assets held in 
United States banks.

I believe that holding Iraq accountable is an essential element in 
its full rehabilitation in the community of nations. This holds true to 
well-settled international law, as well as the Geneva Convention.

I commend my colleagues, Mr. Braley and Mr. Sestak, for their 
leadership and unwavering dedication in bringing this important 
legislation forward. I also commend the Judiciary Committee ranking 
member, Mr. Smith, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) for 
their leadership in making this a bipartisan effort.

I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

I reserve the balance of my time.
