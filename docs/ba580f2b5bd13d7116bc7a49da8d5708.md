Mr. ALTMIRE. Reclaiming my time on that point, what the President has 
done does not coincide with what the Congressional Budget Office says 
the cost of these programs is. Just because in his budget he estimates 
costs and ignores issues like the Alternative Minimum Tax, which needs 
to be fixed, doesn't mean those things aren't going to happen.

He can ignore some of the costs of the Iraq war and the actions in 
Afghanistan and pretend like we are not going to spend as much money as 
it is going to take to carry on activities there. That doesn't mean 
those dollars don't add up. And the Congressional Budget Office and any 
reasonable economist who has taken a fair look at this budget shows 
that he is hundreds of billions of dollars below in his estimations 
what it is going to cost to carry out those.
