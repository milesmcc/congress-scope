Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant First Class 
John ''Gary'' Brown of Nashville, Arkansas, who died on January 20, 
2007, while fighting for our country in Iraq, supporting Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. Gary Brown was 43 years old when the military convoy he 
was riding in was attacked.

After graduating from Nashville High School, Brown attended Ouachita 
Baptist University before enlisting in the Army where he served his 
country for over 20 years. SFC Brown's first tour of duty was in Kuwait 
during Operation Desert Storm and at the time of his death he was 
serving in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Gary Brown was a member of Agape Church in Little Rock where he was 
an active participant in the men's Bible study and the children's bus 
ministry. Brown was also a member of the VFW and the Otter Creek Home 
Owners Association. His dedication to making the communities he lived 
in a better place could not have been greater.

Gary Brown gave his life to serve our country and will forever be 
remembered as a hero, a father, and a husband. My deepest condolences 
go out to his wife Donna; his two stepdaughters Brandy Edmondson and 
Crystal Lunnie both of Little Rock; his brothers Larry Brown of Seguin, 
Texas, and Phil Brown of Nashville; his sister Wendy Wesson; two 
grandsons Christian Edmondson and Joshua Edmondson; and to his many 
nieces and nephews. He will be missed by his family, his church, his 
community and all those who knew him and called him a friend. I will 
continue to keep John ''Gary'' Brown and his family in my thoughts and 
prayers.
