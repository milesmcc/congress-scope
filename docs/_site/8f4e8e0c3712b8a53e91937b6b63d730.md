`Mr. REID â€” 10 April 2008`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate will soon have the 
opportunity to vote for legislation that will help lift struggling 
homeowners, neighborhoods and our economy.

This bipartisan housing bill--forged through compromise and 
cooperation on the part of Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby and others, is 
not perfect.

It is not a magic bullet that will solve the problem. Either coauthor 
would be the first to say that. But it is an important step.

Experts now predict 3 million foreclosures in the next 2 years. 
Another 45 million homeowners will experience reduced value in their 
homes as a result of these foreclosures.

Nevadans are facing the fallout of this crisis more than any other 
state.

In February alone, one out of every 165 homes was in foreclosure. 
That is the highest rate in America.

Nevada's economy is suffering, just as it is throughout America, and 
this bill will help begin to turn things around.

If passed into law, the housing bill now before us would improve the 
prospects and options for families and communities all across our 
country.

During our country's last great banking crisis in the 1930s, the 
Federal Housing Administration, FHA, was created to stabilize the 
economy and help Americans secure the benefits of homeownership.

Over the past three quarters of a century, millions of American 
families have become homeowners with the help of the FHA.

But the rules that govern the FHA have limited the effectiveness of 
the program.

Our housing bill addresses this problem by modernizing the FHA. One 
of the principal benefits will be to permanently raise loan limits to 
$550,000 and to introduce more flexibility into the lending process.

President Bush has announced his support for FHA modernization. 
Democrats and Republicans in Congress agree that it is the right thing 
to do for American families.

This bill will achieve that crucial and bipartisan goal.

Among the many little-noticed consequences of the war in Iraq is that 
thousands of service men and women stationed overseas are struggling to 
meet their mortgage obligations.

The sacrifice of our men and women in uniform is more than enough. 
They should not ever be forced to sacrifice their homes.

Our housing bill will help avoid that terrible prospect. We extend 
for service members the protection period against foreclosure and make 
it easier for them to afford their mortgages.

These are just some of the important provisions that this bill 
includes.

But as I have said before, we must recognize that the upcoming vote 
is just the beginning of a process that begins here in the Senate and 
will continue in the House of Representatives.

I hope that when the process is complete, we will have a strengthened 
bipartisan bill that will do even more to help families, communities 
and our economy.

Yesterday, the administration announced a new program at the FHA that 
would insure new loans that refinance existing mortgages for homeowners 
who are ''underwater,'' meaning that they owe more than their house is 
now worth.

There are reports that 9 million homeowners are now under water. The


administration's proposal is predicted to help just 100,000 of them.

It is encouraging that President Bush is beginning to address the 
core of the crisis, but his proposal does not go far enough.

Chairman Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank have been discussing a 
similar proposal for weeks that could help as many as 2 million.

The importance of our work to help our country weather this crisis 
cannot be overstated.

This week, the Washington Post reported that experts at the Federal 
Reserve have said this:




 The nationwide drop in home prices could put the economy in 


 uncharted territory, as there are no clear precedents for how 


 consumers will respond.


It is time for Congress to take action. Our vote today marks not the 
end but the beginning of that process.
