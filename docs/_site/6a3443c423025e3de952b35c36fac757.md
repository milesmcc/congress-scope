Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I thank the gentleman.

The cost to society, to businesses and our families is unacceptable, 
and we need to move forward. Seventy-nine percent of those treated 
experience reduction of symptoms. We will continue to see these things 
crop up, whether it is veterans returning from Iraq, catastrophic 
happenings in our country such as 9/11, the hurricanes, the floods, the 
fires, all of that is going to cause us to continue to have a better, 
longer look at the effects it is costing our society, and the cost to 
our businesses and to our country. Our government cannot continue to 
ignore this issue. It affects our businesses and our health industry. 
They need to recognize this, and Congress has got to be able to 
recognize they can no longer ignore this. It affects the quality of 
life, and it is vital for the health and well-being of our communities 
and our schools.

I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation. Let's move on 
and remove the stigma for mental health.
