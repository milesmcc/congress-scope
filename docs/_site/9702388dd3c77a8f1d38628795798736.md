Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to enter 
into the Congressional Record today an article that was written by a 
constituent of mine, Thomas J. Carty, PhD, Associate Professor of 
History and American Studies at Springfield College in Springfield, MA. 
His article is entitled, The Risks and Rewards of the Pope's Visit to 
the U.S., and it outlines the history of the interaction of politics 
and religion as it related to papal visits in the past. I thought it 
was a pertinent piece in light of Pope Benedict's recent visit to 
Washington, DC and New York City.





 The Risks and Rewards of the Pope's Visit to the U.S.














(By Thomas J. Carty)




 Pope Benedict XVI's meeting this week with a U.S. president 


 during an election year demonstrates how Americans 


 increasingly tolerate the confluence of religion and 


 politics. While George Bush does not face the prospect of 


 election this year, his meeting with Pope Benedict may affect 


 the presidential campaign. Bush's policies have both 


 delighted and disappointed the Pope. The president's 


 opposition to legalized abortion and embryonic stem-cell 


 research earned him praise by John Paul II, but this pope 


 also critiqued Bush and his father for resorting excessively 


 to war in Panama, the Persian Gulf, and Iraq. For Bush, this 


 meeting offers an opportunity to burnish his legacy as a 


 defender of traditional values.



 Bush can maximize benefit from this meeting by studying the 


 successes and failures of Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and 


 Bill Clinton. Johnson's 1965 decision to greet Pope Paul VI 


 strained traditional diplomatic protocol because no pope had 


 previously set foot in the United States. Prior to the pope's 


 landing in New York in order to deliver a speech at the 


 United Nations, therefore, Johnson arranged elaborate plans 


 to avoid appearing biased in favor of the Catholic Church. 


 The president agreed to wait in New York's Waldorf-Astoria 


 hotel for Pope Paul VI to visit Johnson's suite so that the 


 president could deny having initiated the unofficial summit. 


 Johnson certainly hoped such appeals to the pope might have 


 helped his standing among Catholics in an eventual run for 


 reelection. Yet the pope's public criticisms of U.S. bombing 


 in Southeast Asia contributed to Johnson's later decision to 


 withdraw from the 1968 presidential campaign.



 By contrast, Pope John Paul II boosted Ronald Reagan's 


 political popularity among




 Catholics and conservative non-Catholics in the 1980s. 


 Although the U.S. Catholic bishops opposed the construction 


 of nuclear weapons and criticized Reagan's movement to expand 


 U.S. armaments, John Paul and Reagan shared an uncompromising 


 anticommunism. Meeting with the pope allowed the president 


 to deflect attention from the American Catholic 


 hierarchy's opposition to his arms buildup. When Reagan 


 appointed an official, full-time ambassador to the Vatican 


 in 1984, the president had established a direct diplomatic 


 line of communication with the pope, and subverted the 


 American bishops. Reagan showed none of Johnson's protocol 


 concerns when deciding to stay an extra night in Alaska to 


 coordinate an informal meeting with the pope, whose plane 


 arrived the next day, in May 1984, a year in which a 


 majority of Catholics voted to help him win reelection.



 In the most analogous case with George Bush's position this 


 year, Bill Clinton met with John Paul II in 1999 as a second 


 term president unable to run again for reelection. Absent the 


 Cold War, Clinton aggressively pursued common cause with Pope 


 John Paul II in other areas. Due to Clinton's unapologetic 


 support of legalized abortion and artificial contraception, 


 the policies of this president clashed with the pope's 


 absolute opposition to late-term, or ''partial birth'' 


 abortions. Yet Clinton sought closer connections between U.S. 


 and Vatican economic assistance programs while the Republican 


 congress planned to curtail funding for foreign aid. The 


 Catholic Church also endorsed Clinton's ambitions to provide 


 government assistance to the poor and immigrants. These 


 efforts may have helped Clinton obtain the meeting and photo 


 opportunity with John Paul II at the same time as two Papal 


 Knights in Congress (House Judiciary Committee Chairperson 


 Henry J. Hyde and his legal counsel David P. Shippers) 


 prepared the case for the president's eventual impeachment.



 Since George W. Bush cannot legally compete in the 2008 


 presidential election, Pope Benedict may have more to gain or 


 lose than the president in this year's papal-presidential 


 meeting. Some reports indicate that the pope will court 


 controversy by highlighting abortion in this presidential 


 election year visit to the United States. If so, many 


 Americans will charge the pope with a partisan appeal which 


 threatens America's recent tolerance for Catholicism and 


 church-state cooperation. If Benedict addresses respect for 


 immigrants and the poor, as well as the unborn, however, he 


 can avoid the appearance of favoring one political party 


 platform over another.
