Mr. HODES. Well, as I said at the beginning of the hour, Mr. Murphy 
and Mr. Altmire, I'm on the ''something'' side of 30, but I am glad to 
be with you because I am hoping that we, together, have brought an 
energy to this Congress that really has set a new tone and will help us 
set a new direction for this country, not just on the war on Iraq, but 
on health care, on energy, on education and all the policies that the 
American people want us to get to work on and we've been working hard 
on.

Before we go, I do want to say that Speaker Pelosi's 30-Something 
Working Group can be e-mailed at 30somethingdems@mail.house.gov. The 
30-Somethings, whom I am now a proud guest, being on the something 
side, can be visited, and here is the Web site address on this chart, 
www.speaker.gov/30something/index.html.

So I invite everybody who has been working tonight to visit the 30-
Something Web site for information on what the agenda for America is 
that Democrats have been working on. And I thank you for the 
opportunity to be with you.
