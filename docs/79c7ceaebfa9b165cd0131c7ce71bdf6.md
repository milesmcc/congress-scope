`Mr. BOEHNER â€” 23 March 2007`

Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I think the moment is here, a moment that 
we have been debating over the last 2/1/2/ months and an issue that I 
think the American people care deeply about.

It is an historic moment, and I thought to myself this morning how 
will history judge what it is that we are doing on the floor of the 
House today. What will they write 50 years from now about the decisions 
that we are making here today?

When I handed Ms. Pelosi, our new Speaker, the gavel back in January, 
I said that the battle of ideas should be fought on the floor of the 
House, but as we do it, we should respect each other's opinion. We can 
disagree without being disagreeable.

I have great respect for Mr. Murtha and Mr. Obey, those that have 
brought this bill to the floor today, along with Mr. Young and Mr. 
Lewis, and we should respect all of our opinions and each other's 
opinions when we get into this difficult decision.

All of us wish that Iraq had gone better. We all wish that the 
mistakes had not been made and that the terrorists would not have shown 
up and made this a central front in our war with them.



The fact is, we are in Iraq. We are in the midst of a fight with an 
enemy that is just not in Iraq, that is all over the world, and we are 
there. You begin to think about the bill that we have before us to pay 
for the war in Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq. Somehow we have room 
for $10 billion worth of nonmilitary spending.

I don't need to go through all the details for the money for spinach, 
the money for the Capitol Hill power plant. That is a real emergency, 
things that don't belong in this bill.

But I think all of us know what the greater issue is here, and the 
bigger issue. That is that the ideas of our friend from Pennsylvania, 
to put his benchmarks in there, which are very different than the 
benchmarks that I proposed. The benchmarks I proposed were to measure 
progress, for trying to help ensure that we win. The benchmarks I see 
in this bill are intended to bring about failure, to bring about 
stumbles.

If you look at all of the handcuffs, all of the hoops and hurdles 
that are in here, I believe there is only one outcome, only one outcome 
if we support all this brings and the handcuffs, and that outcome is 
failure. I don't believe that failure in Iraq is an option. There is a 
lot riding on this.

Just think for a moment what signal, what signal this sends to our 
enemies. What does it say to them, we are not willing to stand behind 
our troops, that there is a hard deadline out there, that we are going 
to withdraw our troops; what signal does it send to them?

Our enemies understand what happened in Vietnam. When this Congress 
voted to cut off funding, we left Vietnam. We left chaos and genocide 
in the streets of Vietnam because we pulled the troops out and didn't 
have the will to win.

Our enemies know what happened in 1983 after the Marine barracks were 
bombed in Lebanon, and we pulled out. What did we see? Chaos and 
genocide all through Lebanon, and continuing to this day. Then in 1993, 
we decided to pull out of Somalia; left chaos and genocide in our wake 
that continues to this day.

Who doesn't believe, who doesn't believe that if we go down this 
path, we are going to leave chaos and genocide in Iraq, and we are 
going to tell our enemies all around the world that you can take on the 
United States, you can push them to the edge? At the end of the day, 
they will just go home.

The spread of radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to our Nation and 
is a threat to the free world, not just in the Middle East. They are in 
Asia, they are in Europe, they are in Africa. Cells are growing right 
here in America, people dedicated to killing Americans, killing our 
allies, and ending freedom and wanting to impose some radical Islamic 
law on the entire world.

I ask you, what are we to do, just walk away from the fight? What 
message does this action that we take


today, what does it send, what kind of message does it send to our 
allies, to people who have worked with us over the course of the last 
50 years, 100 years, to bring freedom around the world, to end tyranny 
around the world? What message do we send to them, that we are there as 
long as it doesn't get too tough?

Think about what Franklin Roosevelt must have felt like in the midst 
of World War II when things weren't going so well either in Europe or 
over in the South Pacific. I am sure there was a big debate here in 
Congress, the same way, same time. But Franklin Roosevelt knew that the 
world had no choice but to stop Imperial Japan and to stop Hitler's 
Germany, because he knew that the consequences of failure in World War 
II were going to lead to more tyranny and less freedom all around the 
world. He didn't shrink from that challenge.

But more importantly, think about what this message sends to our 
troops. Our troops are on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan doing 
their duty to protect freedom and to end tyranny. They are there 
watching this debate that we are having in the House today and 
wondering, will Congress do its duty? Will Congress stand up and 
support the mission that I am in?

Think about the soldiers right this moment who are on a mission 
somewhere in Baghdad trying to bring safety and security to those 
people while this debate goes on and this vote is about to occur as to 
whether we are going to support what they are doing. This is an 
important moment.

Our forefathers, our forefathers had this moment many times before. 
Whether it was George Washington or Abraham Lincoln in the middle of 
the Civil War, when it wasn't going very well, they had a decision to 
make. Was failure an option for any of them? No, it wasn't.

I know this is difficult, and I know there are deeply held opinions 
on both sides of the aisle and amongst both sides of the aisle, but I 
would ask all of my colleagues, is failure an option? Do we want to 
give victory a chance?

We sent General Petraeus over there, 84-0, was confirmed by the 
Senate. The plan is under way. What this bill will do will be to 
undercut his opportunity at success.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to say to you that we have no choice 
but to win, because if we fail in Iraq, you will see the rise even 
further and faster of radical Islamic terrorism all around the world. 
We will see chaos in Baghdad. We will see genocide there. We will 
provide safe haven for our enemies. We will destabilize the moderate 
Arab countries in the Middle East. If anybody doesn't believe that this 
won't end Israel as I know it, you are kidding yourself. If you don't 
believe that these terrorists won't come here and fight us on the 
streets of America instead of the streets of Baghdad, I think you are 
kidding yourself.

So we have our moment of truth. We have our opportunity to do what 
our forefathers have done, and that is to stand up, support our troops 
and to win, because the outcome of failure is actually too ominous to 
even think about.

So I ask my colleagues today, let's not vote for spinach, let's not 
vote for more money for the power plant and all the other silly things 
in here. We all know what this bill is about, and it is about whether 
we have got the courage to give victory a chance, or whether we are 
just going to bring our troops home and give up.
