Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, as we approach the 
Fourth of July, I want to thank our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and 
across the world. It is because of their service that we are able to 
celebrate our freedom.

In my seven visits to Iraq and three to Afghanistan, I have seen 
firsthand the new greatest generation. Our coalition forces are 
stopping the terrorists overseas to protect American families at home. 
Osama bin Laden's right-hand man and al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri has 
proclaimed that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central fronts in the 
global war on terrorism.

I look forward to honoring the sacrifices of our troops this Fourth 
of July weekend at the Celebration of Liberty service with Pastor 
Wendell Estep of First Baptist Church in Columbia.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th.
