Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the gentleman for his comments.

Now I would like to yield some time to a good friend who has been 
patiently waiting here, Dr. Gingrey of Georgia, a fellow physician, a 
member of the Armed Services Committee who has traveled to Iraq, and we 
would like to hear what he has to say.
