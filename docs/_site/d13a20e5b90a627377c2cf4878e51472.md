Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of America's 
bravest, Private First Class Clay McGarrah, who sacrificed his life in 
Afghanistan on our Nation's birthday in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom. Private First Class McGarrah, also a specialist in the United 
States Army, was a lifelong resident of Arkansas' Third District, where 
he attended Harrison High School. His loved ones describe McGarrah as a 
hardworking hero before he ever made his free choice to join the United 
States Army.

In addition to being described as a joy who brought happiness to the 
loved ones around him, McGarrah was also extremely patriotic and 
sacrificed himself for his life's passion for the military and our 
great Nation. Specialist McGarrah was assigned to C Company, 2nd 
Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division in 
Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He deployed to Afghanistan in June.

Private First Class Clay McGarrah made the ultimate sacrifice for his 
country at the young age of 20. He is a true America hero. I ask my 
colleagues to keep his family and friends in their thoughts and prayers 
during this very difficult time, and I humbly offer my appreciation and 
gratitude to this American hero for his selfless service to the 
security and well-being of our country.
