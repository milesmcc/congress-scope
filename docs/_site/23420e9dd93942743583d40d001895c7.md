Mr. REID. Mr. President, if one of the Democratic hopefuls had said 
it, I would also be trying to spin it in a way that looked good. The 
fact is, you can't spin what Senator McCain said at that town hall 
meeting in a favorable light. His record speaks for itself as to how he 
feels about the war in Iraq.

My friend always talks about the fact the American people don't want 
attacks here. Of course, they don't want attacks here at home. Of 
course, they don't. Everyone should understand, though, that prior to 
the invasion of Iraq, there was not a terrorist in Iraq, and now, of 
course, there are lots of them. We need to focus on Osama bin Laden, on 
his safe haven he has in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and as General Casey--
also an active member of the military--said, we need to get more troops 
into Afghanistan. We can't do that when we have 140,000 troops this 
July in Iraq.
