Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor the 
heroic sacrifice of a courageous Alabamian who selflessly risked 
himself to save members of his unit under attack.

PFC Johnathon M. Millican was tragically killed on January 20, 2007, 
in Karbala, Iraq. A member of the 377th Parachute Field Artillery 
Regiment from Fort Richardson, AK, he risked his own safety to cover an 
enemy grenade with his body during an attack by insurgents.

For his gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States, 
Private First Class Millican was posthumously awarded the Silver Star, 
our Nation's third highest award for combat valor. While this is a 
great honor and one deserving of Private First Class Millican's 
actions, I believe his act of heroism and bravery deserves our Nation's 
highest honor. Therefore, I have asked the Department of Defense to 
consider him for the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration 
awarded by the United States. Private First Class Millican went beyond 
the call of duty and risked his own life not only to protect our Nation 
but to save members of his unit.

I offer my thoughts, prayers and condolences to Private First Class 
Millican's family. His loss symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice one can 
make for our county. His service represented his commitment to protect 
his family, community, and our Nation.

I am honored to stand before the Senate today to pay tribute to the 
life and service of PFC Johnathon Millican. Private First Class 
Millican's dedication to the principles of freedom and democracy will 
serve as an example to all of us, for generations to come. It is my 
hope that he will be duly honored with the Medal of Honor, but even if 
Private First Class Millican is not awarded the Medal of Honor, he is 
no less a hero.
