# RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT
## `8fdc4870b77e8b834c3f34bdd6d528cb`
`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 12 July 2007`

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.

For all that we disagree on here today, we agree on one thing: We all 
want a stable, independent Iraq. What I can't understand is how anyone 
can still believe that our continued, open-ended military intervention 
there will lead to a stable nation. In fact, it's doing the opposite.

The Iraqi Parliament and ministries are in unprecedented disarray. 
The President's own report to Congress will say that we haven't met any 
of our political benchmarks there, and an estimated 13,000 Iraqis are 
dead since the escalation began.

The fact is, as someone much wiser than I said, the Iraqis today are 
paying wholesale rather than retail for their political decisions. So 
long as we are the military bodyguard for every major Iraqi political 
group, so long as we are subsidizing the political decisions of Iraqi 
political leaders, they will never make the difficult political 
concessions necessary to create a stable society there.

I support this bill, Mr. Speaker, because not another American 
soldier should die for a strategy that is unfathomably making Iraq less 
safe and less stable.
