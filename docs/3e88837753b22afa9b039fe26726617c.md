`Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas â€” 12 June 2008`

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. The highest number of unemployment in 20 
years in the month of May, and over the last 12 months, the number of 
unemployed workers have grown by 1.6 million, 200,000 more long-term 
jobless.

Who will be the Good Samaritan for the American people who have 
helped build this country? Who will tell the Iraqi soldiers and 
Afghanistan soldiers that the mother and father that is there longing 
for their return does not have a job and cannot pay for gasoline and 
rent and food? We have to stand today. Who will be the Good Samaritans?

This legislation is written the way it is to solve the problems of 
Americans. I will stand with them.

I ask you to support the underlying legislation and the rule.
