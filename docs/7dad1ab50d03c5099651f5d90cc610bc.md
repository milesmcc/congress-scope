Mr. McGOVERN. A great deal of attention has been focused on the 
recent Rolling Stone article which resulted in the resignation of 
General Stanley McChrystal. But even more troublesome to me than the 
general's inappropriate remarks were the comments by senior military 
officials about the state of the war and the future of our involvement 
in Afghanistan, which seem to contradict what the Obama administration 
has told us. ''If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to 
this war, it would become even less popular,'' a senior military 
adviser said. Another said, ''Instead of beginning to withdraw troops 
next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its 
counterinsurgency campaign even further.''

Madam Speaker, the American people and our troops deserve to know the 
truth about what we are doing in Afghanistan. We need clarity. We 
should have clarity before we bring up any war supplemental 
appropriations bill.
