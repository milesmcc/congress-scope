Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, another 8 months have passed, and more 
American troops have lost their lives overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
I wish to honor their service and sacrifice by including their names in 
the Congressional Record.

Since I last included the names of our fallen troops on November 2, 
2009, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 313 troops in Iraq and 
in Operation Enduring Freedom, which includes Afghanistan. They will 
not be forgotten, and today I submit their names into the Record:
