Mr. WHITFIELD. I rise to support the en bloc amendments. All of us 
know all too well that many young men and women returning from Iraq and 
Afghanistan have suffered serious physical and emotional injuries, 
including post-traumatic stress syndrome.

Camp Lejeune, Camp Pendleton, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and Walter 
Reed have rehabilitative programs that include the therapeutic use of 
animals to treat these wounded warriors, and preliminary results show 
that these programs are particularly effective.

In the en bloc amendment I have an amendment that simply directs the 
Department of Defense, working with HHS and the Veterans' 
Administration, to conduct a study to determine whether the therapeutic 
use of animals to treat these wounded warriors should be expanded to 
other facilities and military installations around the country.

I urge support of the en bloc amendment and this amendment.
