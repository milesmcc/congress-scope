Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I still anticipate that. With reference to the gentleman's question 
regarding the number of bills, based upon the comments of Mr. Murtha, I 
have not talked to him personally but that have been reported, it is my 
understanding that he is thinking of one bill, not both an Afghanistan 
and an Iraq.

The problem is while there is, I think, pretty universal support for 
the effort in Afghanistan as being critical to our fight on terrorism, 
there is more disagreement on the Iraq component and what we ought to 
be doing there. But the way the budget is structured, it would be very 
difficult to consider them discretely, Afghanistan and Iraq. So it is 
my understanding that Mr. Murtha has recommended and intends to pursue 
it as one bill.
