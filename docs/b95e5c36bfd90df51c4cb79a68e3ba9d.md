Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield to a gentleman, in 
fact, the next two gentlemen have sons who have served in the Iraqi 
theater. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline) has a son who is a 
Blackhawk helicopter pilot who has served, I believe, in both theaters 
and has quite a bit of experience in some very difficult operations. 
The gentleman always has an excellent insight on this important 
operation. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), I would like to 
give him 3 minutes.
