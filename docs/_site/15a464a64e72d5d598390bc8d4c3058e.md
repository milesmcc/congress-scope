Mr. McDERMOTT. I will give you a reason why we ought to have this 
amendment. We know what happens when we give this President a blank 
check. It always goes badly. We get a


banner, Mission Accomplished, and he gets to continue a failed war that 
has now claimed the U.S. economy as its latest casualty. That is why I 
urge my colleagues to approve this Lee amendment.

This lame duck President must not be able to indenture the next 
President to carry on a disastrous war of security. This is a lame duck 
administration trying to rewrite history, and they will tie the hands 
of the Nation into a knot in the process if we let them. The next 
President and the next Congress are the only ones who should determine 
the future policy in Iraq. This amendment ensures this will happen.

The President has had a blank check since 2001, and we see where we 
are. This amendment brings some balance to the process. It's time to 
close the blank check account for a lame duck President. We ought to 
approve the Lee amendment and preserve our chance in the future to get 
out of Iraq.
