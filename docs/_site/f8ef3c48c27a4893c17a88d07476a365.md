Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, before I begin, I would first like to thank 
you for reminding the body of the need for decorum in our remarks

Madam Speaker, several points. First is, it is stunning to me that 
this body will consume over 36 hours of floor debate on a nonbinding 
resolution. This should be on the consent calendar. Irrespective of 
one's position on the war in Iraq, all taxpayers are right to be 
incensed at such waste in this Congress.

This legislation will not have the effect of law, will neither 
inspire nor impede military action in Iraq or elsewhere, will not 
encourage our troops on the ground nor foster victory over America's 
enemies that practice terror. It will have one effect: poking the 
President of the United States in the eye, diminishing his credibility 
among the international community and eroding his ability to lead here 
at home. It will also have the very genuine result of undermining and 
demoralizing our soldiers that are now in harm's way.

Second, equally stunning is the apparent preoccupation with demeaning 
President Bush while ignoring those who are our real enemies. Our 
enemies are not in the White House or the Defense Department. They are 
not people like David Petraeus or his staff. They are not the vast 
majority of Muslims throughout the world, who, like us, want simply to 
live peaceful and secure lives.

America's enemies are radical Islamists, less than 1 percent of all 
Muslims, whose faith requires that a pure Islamic state be established 
and that violence is the instrument by which to establish it. Their 
faith requires terrorist acts against the West and all Muslims who 
stand in the way of that agenda. That is why Osama bin Laden can say 
that he and his followers are ''in love with death.'' Indiscriminate 
slaughter is, for these sick people, merely a tool in their arsenal of 
moral barbarity.

That is why his second-in-command has declared that Iraq and 
Afghanistan are ''the two most crucial fields'' in their war. That is 
why al Qaeda in Iraq has declared an Islamic state in Iraq's Anbar 
Province.

Third, how do America's enemies view us? For one thing, they fear 
George W. Bush and our military. That is why Libya's Mu'ammar Qadhafi 3 
years ago surrendered his nuclear materials to the U.S. That is why 
Moqtada al-Sadr, Iraq's most powerful militia leader, just made a 
beeline for Iran; not for a sunny vacation from long, tiresome days of 
planning suicide bombings, but because he feared for his life.



But America's enemies view Congress quite differently. They see us as 
divided, irresolute, unwilling to face honestly their concerted plan 
for our destruction. Hence, this nonbinding resolution.

In light of this reality, I would ask my friends across the aisle, 
what is your binding plan for defeating America's enemies? America, our 
allies and our enemies are still waiting for your binding plan.

More than 3,000 Americans have died upholding the hope of defeating 
America's real enemies and bringing freedom to Iraq. We must not allow 
their deaths to become a pretext for the abandonment of that hope of 
victory or abandoning the Iraqi people. But rather, they must serve as 
the inspiration of a renewed commitment to hope of victory and security 
for Iraq. We owe to their heroism and sacrifice nothing less than one 
thing, victory over America's enemies in Iraq.

America is the last best hope of man on Earth. A victory in Iraq is 
our last best hope of defeat of America's most dangerous enemies and 
also the freedom and security in the Middle East. We must not fail.
