Mr. KUCINICH. We're destroying our Nation's moral and fiscal 
integrity with the war supplemental. Instead of ending wars in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and Pakistan now, by appropriating only enough money to 
bring our troops home, Congress abdicates its constitutional authority, 
defers to the President and asks for a report. That's right. All we're 
asking for is a report on when the President will end the war.

There's money, too, for the IMF, presumably to bail out private 
European banks, billions for the IMF so they can force low- and middle-
income nations to cut jobs, wages, health care and retirement security, 
just like corporate America does to our constituents.

And there's money to incentivize the purchase of more cars, but not 
necessarily from the U.S. because a ''Buy America'' mandate was not 
allowed. Another $106 billion, and all we get is a lousy war. Pretty 
soon, that's going to be about the only thing made in America: war.
