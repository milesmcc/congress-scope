Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for 
yielding, and also for your leadership on this issue.

I am very concerned with Iran's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, 
like I am concerned about any country's efforts to acquire nuclear 
weapons. Preventing this, though, will not happen through military 
action.

Unfortunately, the President's saber rattling against Iran is only 
increasing and is eerily similar to the march to war with Iraq. We must 
act to prevent another war of preemption, this time against Iran.

That is why this amendment is so important. It would clarify that no 
previous authorization constitutes an authorization to use force 
against Iran.

Secondly, this amendment would make certain that no funds would be 
used to take military action against Iran in the absence of specific 
congressional authority or a direct attack as defined by the War Powers 
Act.

Beyond this, we must make certain that the United States is not 
funding covert action intended to cause regime change in Iran. 
Unfortunately, the Rules Committee did not rule in order an amendment 
that I would have that allowed for this sort of debate.

I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and also to recognize 
that this is a critical first step this body can take in preventing war 
with Iran.
