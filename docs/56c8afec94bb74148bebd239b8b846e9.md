Mr. MITCHELL. Can I add one other thing? And I think this is very 
important.

We just introduced this last week the Dignity for Wounded Warriors 
Act; and this is to look at the long-term effect, not just of what is 
happening right now.

The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act of 2007, we introduced this to 
ensure that injured soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan 
receive the care they deserve. It sets the standard of care for our 
wounded. It sets the standard for military medical facilities, and it 
cuts through the red tape our wounded and their families have to 
navigate through.

So we are looking at not just now but, as you said, this is a long 
term, and I think we are going to address that with this Dignity for 
Wounded Warriors Act. I am very excited about that, and I think when 
you see this come to the floor this will have overwhelming support.
