`Mr. YOUNG of Florida â€” 24 May 2007`

---


Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lewis for yielding the 
time. And I rise in very strong support of the warfighting 
supplemental. Mr. Murtha and I have worked together very closely to 
make sure that the numbers were what our soldiers and sailors and 
airmen and Marines and Coast Guardsmen were what they needed as they 
continue this battle in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The suggestions that I have seen today in the media that this 
political group lost or this political group won, I don't believe 
either one, any of those. The victory goes to the members of our 
military who are going to have the funding that they need to make sure 
that they have the equipment that they need and whatever else that they 
need.

Something else that it does, it proves that the Constitution is good. 
It proves that, by legislators working together along with the 
executive branch of government, that we can come to a solution.

Mr. Murtha and I strongly support the dollars. We did disagree, and 
there was no secret about that, on the language that he had originally 
inserted. But we all worked that out. And during our many 
conversations, we both agreed, and we both knew that we had to come to 
an agreement, not only here in the House and in the Senate, but with 
the White House. And that's what we've done.

And I think this is a good package, and I hope that for those who 
might be wavering and thinking that they're not going to vote for this 
warfighting supplemental, think about that, because it is a good 
package, and it's one that I strongly support.

And I commend leadership on both sides for having been able to come 
to this agreement and this compromise on a very good piece of 
legislation.

I'm not sure if that's going to be amendment No. 1 or amendment No. 
2, but whichever amendment it is, I hope that all of us will vote for 
it and support it sincerely and aggressively.
