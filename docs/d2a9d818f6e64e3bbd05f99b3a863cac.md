Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would just say again, this is a temporary 
measure. We have these brave men and women who are leaving to care for 
our troops in Iraq, we're in a time of war, and I think it's just a 
very special circumstance right now. So I would urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support passage.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
