Mr. LAUTENBERG. Fort Monmouth researchers also develop critical 
technology for our Armed Forces, such as ''Warlock Jammers,'' which 
were engineered at Fort Monmouth and modified for use in Iraq. This 
equipment emits radio frequencies that interfere with the signals that 
set off improvised explosive devices known as IEDs. The military was 
able to deploy them within 60 days of their development, and they 
started saving American lives.
