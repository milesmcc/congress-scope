Mrs. BLACKBURN. I would like to put that photo back up, if you do not 
mind.

Now, I think it is significant that you're talking about Ramadi, 
which is in al Anbar Province. And you're talking about a photo that 
was made during the summer, July 14, 2007, which is the photo stamp 
date that is there on the photo. And if I am picking all of this up, it 
looks like tools and implements that are hanging in the ceiling of the 
shop, and plastic buckets, rubber buckets, and probably some plastic 
hampers that are there. And when I was in Iraq, I noticed that there 
was lots of produce that was also being sold in some of the shops.

But one of the things that is of interest to me is the photo that 
you're showing indicates to us that we do have import and export that 
is taking place, and we do have commerce that is taking place. And so, 
as you were on that street in Ramadi, how many shops did you see; do 
you remember a number? How many were lining the street? And how far did 
you drive from the base into town to begin to see this type of commerce 
and the happy kids that are obviously learning how to do a little bit 
of retail merchant work there?

I yield back to the gentleman.
