Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, 
sacrifice, and heroism


of Marine Corps Lance Corporal Nathaniel Schultz, of Safety Harbor, FL.

LCpl Schultz, an assistant gunner, was killed in the line of duty in 
Afghanistan on August 21st while supporting combat operations in 
Helmand Province. In the finest tradition of the U.S. Marine Corps, 
LCpl Schultz wanted to serve his country because he wanted to serve the 
American people and help the young children of Afghanistan.

Outside of the Marine Corps, Nate was an extraordinary young man. He 
was a graduate of Countryside High School who enjoyed skateboarding, 
playing guitars, and participating in outdoor activities.

Madam Speaker, though proud to have such a fine example from the 
Tampa Bay community, it is with great remorse that I rise to 
commemorate the life of LCpl Schultz. The young men and women, such as 
Nathaniel Schultz, who choose to serve their countrymen in the armed 
forces, amaze me. I appreciate their professionalism and dedication. 
Their sacrifice, like that of LCpl Schultz, will not be forgotten.
