# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes just to give some 
information that my great friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes), 
commented on.

I made a comment a few minutes ago that I had understood that the 
Democrat leadership or a member of that leadership had stated that they 
would use DOD management policies to cut off the sending of either 
reinforcements or supplies to the warfighting theater and that I would 
oppose that very strongly.

My friend Mr. Reyes expressed doubt that that had happened. He said 
he had not heard about it.

I just wanted to inform him I have the Reuters report here, and it 
quotes our colleague Mr. Murtha: ''A leading congressional opponent of 
the war in Iraq on Thursday said his plans for placing conditions on 
how President George W. Bush can spend $93.4 billion in new combat 
funds would effectively stop an American troop buildup.'' This is 
quoting Mr. Murtha.

Mr. Murtha says: ''They won't be able to continue. They won't be able 
to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment, they don't have 
the training, and they won't be able to do the work. There's no 
question in my mind.''

That is the statement upon which I based my remarks a few minutes 
ago. It appears that statement has been made.
