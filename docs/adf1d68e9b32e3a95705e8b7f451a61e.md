Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in 
consideration of H. Con. Res. 198, as amended, which expresses the 
sense of Congress that the United States has a moral responsibility to 
meet the needs of those persons, groups and communities that are 
impoverished, disadvantaged or otherwise in poverty.

H. Con. Res. 198 was introduced by Representative Barbara Lee on 
August 1, 2007, and was amended and reported from the Oversight 
Committee on December 12 by a voice vote. The measure has the support 
and sponsorship of 80 Members of Congress and reminds each of us of the 
important role we play in the battle against poverty.

Madam Speaker, I want to continue with certain of my remarks in the 
Record, but I would like to make other remarks at this time.

We have just come from the celebration of the birth of Martin Luther 
King, Jr. His signature issues, of course, were war and peace and 
poverty, falling only behind civil rights. It's clear that he achieved 
what he desired, certainly much of what we desired, because during the 
1960s there were three seminal civil rights bills passed, long-time 
goals of African Americans, other people of color, and many in this 
Chamber.

But two of King's goals remain completely without remedy. One, of 
course, is war and peace, and you can imagine where he would have been 
on the war in Iraq. But perhaps, most telling, is that we celebrated 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday at a time when the gap between rich 
and poor is considerably wider than when King died.

Therefore, I am not sure whether the gentlewoman from California had 
in mind that we would bring this bill up right after Martin Luther King 
Jr.'s birthday, but there it is, and that makes it all the more timely.

As it turns out, though, Madam Speaker, the state of the economy has 
rendered this issue high on the national agenda for the first time in 
many years. For the first time, the entire Congress will be looking or 
should be looking at those who have the least in our society and why. I 
am afraid it's not because of their high priority. They are the lowest 
voting group. They sometimes are invisible. But the fact is that 
economists across the board have said that we need to enact a stimulus 
package yesterday, and that in order for it to have any effect, and, in 
fact, not be effective when it might do more harm than good, we need to 
get the stimulus package in the pockets of people who can spend the 
money immediately.



Therefore, many of us think that the people we know who will spend 
the money tomorrow are the people who have no money to spend. The 
people who run out of food stamps in the middle of the month. The 
people who have run out of unemployment security. The people who need 
the most but who have the lowest profile often in the Congress now have 
assumed importance because of the state of the economy.

Madam Speaker, what is most distressing was to see that the poverty 
rate increased even for people 65 and over by almost 400,000 people. 
The one group of people that, in fact, gets some attention in the 
Congress, of course, are the elderly. They are the highest percentage 
of voting people; yet, their poverty rate is going up. That is very 
distressing since they are on fixed incomes and are least able to do 
something about it. They don't get unemployment insurance, many of them 
don't.

I am particularly concerned about the people who don't show up on the 
tax rolls. Many, if not most of them, pay payroll taxes. The only way 
to focus on them is to focus on them who needs, who will spend the 
money first should get the money first.

My concern about the baby boomers, those over 65, is not only that 
they should be in this group. I know they will spend the money 
instantly. But my concern is to wonder whether or not this is a 
harbinger of the baby boomers, the first baby boomers have just come 
forward, whether we are about to see that huge group of people show up, 
bringing increased pressure on the economy.

So I compliment the gentlelady from California for coming forward 
with a bill that I am sure will have bipartisan support.

In the District of Columbia, I have to tell her that we are not a 
poor city. We are second per capita in Federal income taxes and, 
therefore, a lot of middle-class and rich people in the District of 
Columbia, but one of every three children in the District of Columbia 
lives in poverty.

I want to make sure that whatever we do to stimulate the economy or 
to pay attention to this resolution hits those children very quickly. 
We have 10 percent of District residents living in extreme poverty, 
even though the District cannot be counted among those cities which 
have lost so much, many of them lost a base, because we have the 
Federal Government here, because even our real estate industry 
continues to boom.



Madam Speaker, I think this timely resolution is important not only 
for its own sake, but because it draws our attention to what I believe 
will be a first priority for the Congress this session, especially 
today as our congressional leadership on both sides of the aisle are 
meeting with the President of the United States on the very stimulus 
package that I have described.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
