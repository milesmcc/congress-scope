Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I will just take 1 minute to observe this: 
The gentleman from Arizona has said, in reference to this project, 
enough is enough. Let me ask why don't we say enough is enough to 
spending $600 billion in a futile and fruitless and misguided war in 
Iraq? Why don't we say enough is enough in putting the needs of 
millionaires who are going to get $57 billion in tax cuts this year 
ahead of the needs of average working people with respect to 
investments in their education, their job training, and their community 
development and their health care? I think, indeed, enough is enough, 
but we ought to be saying that about the right things.

Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
