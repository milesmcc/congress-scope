`Mr. AKAKA â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to express my very deep concern 
about the administration's ongoing policy in Iraq. As a member of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Readiness, I have had the privilege to hear the testimony of our troop 
commanders, to hear our soldiers, to hear their families, and now--now 
more than ever--I insist we bring an end to this conflict.

Already too many lives have been lost, too many men and women have 
been wounded and permanently injured, and too many spouses, parents, 
and children have suffered the pain of separation and too often 
permanent loss of a loved one.

Yet according to the new National Intelligence Estimate, al-Qaida is 
growing stronger, and we are no closer to achieving a sustainable 
security in Iraq. We must make it clear to the Iraqi political leaders 
that the future of Iraq is in their hands, and they must learn to reach 
the political compromises necessary for a functioning democracy.

Once again, we are at a crossroads. We can either continue to pursue 
a policy that is no longer working or we can move forward and implement 
a strategy that will set us on a new course. The time is now to 
reevaluate the costs of this war.

We must understand that the long-term responsibility for caring for 
those injured during their service and for the families of those who 
died is a true cost of war. Over 3,600 members of the Armed Forces have 
given their lives in the service of this Nation. Thousands more will 
come home with injuries, both physical and psychological, that will 
require treatment and rehabilitation, processes that can take, as we 
know now, many years. Invisible wounds that are difficult to detect, 
such as PTSD and mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, will affect a 
great many servicemembers. In addition, it will make it difficult for 
them to adjust to civilian life as they deal with long-lasting visions 
and experiences they encountered in combat.

While we can help the brave troops by passing critical legislation 
that will provide much needed counseling, these invisible wounds will 
take a long time to heal. Clearly, the total cost of the current 
conflicts includes both the loss of lives and resources needed to help 
a new generation of young combat veterans heal.

The American people also believe that now is the time to begin the 
process of bringing our troops home. According to a recent poll, 63 
percent of Americans believe that we should no longer continue on the 
present course of action set by the administration. They believe, as I 
believe, that the present surge has not been a success, and waiting 
until September to reconsider our approach is simply prolonging a war 
that is no longer our fight.

I urge my Senate colleagues to support the Levin-Reed amendment to 
the Defense authorization bill, which will send a clear message to the 
citizens of this country that we hear their concerns and we agree it is 
time to bring our loved ones home.

I yield the floor.
