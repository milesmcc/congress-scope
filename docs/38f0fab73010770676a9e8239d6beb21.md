Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I rise in support of this en bloc amendment, which includes my 
amendment to improve oversight of contractors in Afghanistan. The 
United States employs over 100,000 contractors in Afghanistan, and we 
need to ensure that we have adequate oversight. Reckless behavior by 
contractors can endanger our mission in Afghanistan, and failure to 
adequately oversee money can leave billions of taxpayer dollars 
vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse.

My amendment requires the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan 
Reconstruction to report to Congress on existing contractor oversight 
and make recommendations for increasing oversight and preventing 
contractors with a history of waste, fraud and abuse from getting 
future contracts.



I would like to thank Chairman Skelton for supporting this amendment, 
as well as cosponsors Congressmen McGovern, Conyers, Hinchey and Moran.
