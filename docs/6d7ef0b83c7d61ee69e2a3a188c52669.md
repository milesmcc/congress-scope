`Mr. LEWIS of Georgia â€” 30 April 2009`

---


Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. I want to thank my friend for yielding.

You know by now that we have had a very busy agenda during this break 
period, including the bills we have already completed: National Water 
Research and Development Initiative Act, credit card legislation, hate 
crimes legislation, the budget conference report; and next week, we 
expect to pass the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act and 
the Fight Fraud Act of 2009.

I must tell you that in addition before the Memorial Day break, we 
will need to pass the supplemental appropriation for Iraq and 
Afghanistan. The President sent his request on April 10 for more than 
$83 billion. We expect the House and Senate to act on the request 
before the Memorial Day recess.
