Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.

Madam Speaker, there was an old comedian who used to say: When 
somebody says it's not about the money, it's about the money. When the 
gentleman says it isn't about the Labor, Health and Education bill, 
it's about the Labor, Health and Education bill.

The gentleman objects to the fact that we are doing what has been 
done in this institution for many years. We are taking the bills that 
are finished in both Houses at this time and we are trying to get them 
to the President in the fastest possible way. And the way to do that is 
to send them down together.

Now, the President wants to cherry-pick. He wants to pick and choose. 
He said you have got to send me 11 separate bills. He didn't send us 11 
separate bills. The President sends us one omnibus budget. He put all 
the departments together in one document and sent them down to us. We 
are sending him back whatever proposals we can put together in the 
fastest possible time.

Madam Speaker, he says that the Labor-Health bill is bloated. Well, 
let me compare it to the President's budget. The President says that he 
is the ''great decider'' and that he is going to decide how much money 
is going to be in this bill and we have got to live within that limit 
or else he's going to veto anything else we send him. If we live under 
the President's budget, we would cut vocational education by 50 
percent. Anybody think that is a good idea? If we live under the 
President's budget, we would eliminate all student aid but Work-Study 
and Pell Grants. Anybody here really believe that is a good idea?

In all my years in Congress, I never heard anybody say: Obey, why 
don't you guys get together and cut cancer research. Yet, that is what 
this previous Republican Congress and the President have done the last 
2 years; they have cut 1,100 grants out of the National Institutes of 
Health, medical research grants. If you want to live under the 
President's budget on law enforcement, we would cut what the committee 
has in its bill by one-third. The President wants us to cut handicapped 
kids' education by $300 million. Mr. Walsh, the ranking Republican 
member of the Labor-Health Subcommittee, led the objection to that, and 
in fact persuaded the committee to put a higher number in the bill than 
I had put in in the chairman's mark; yet the President says we ought to 
follow his budget for Labor-Health. If we do, we will cut rural health 
by 54 percent.

He also wants us down the line to cut the Clean Water Revolving Fund 
by 37 percent. He wants us to cut disabled housing assistance by 47 
percent. He has ordered his Secretary of Veterans Affairs to send us a 
letter indicating that they don't want the $4 billion that we have 
added to veterans health care.

So you don't think this is about priorities? You bet you, it's about 
priorities. I submit to you, the teachers of this country, the school 
kids of this country, the parents of this country, and the veterans 
aren't going to be fooled. Veterans aren't going to be very thrilled if 
you take care of their needs so long as they are in Iraq, but the 
minute they get home you forget the help their kid's need to get an 
education, you forget the help their wife's needs or husband's needs if 
they run into medical problems.

Veterans are whole people, just like everybody else. This Congress 
has an obligation to meet all of their needs, not just their needs so 
long as they are wearing the uniform and then forget them once they 
take it off. That is not the American way. It shouldn't be the 
Congress's way. That is why we are proceeding as we are proceeding.
