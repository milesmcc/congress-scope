`Mr. INOUYE â€” 19 May 2009`

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to thank both leaders of the Senate 
for their gracious remarks.

Today, the Senate will begin to consider the request for supplemental 
appropriations for fiscal year 2009. As we all know, the President has 
requested $84.9 billion in new budget authority, first, to cover the 
costs of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it includes 
funds for the supporting costs to those operations, and to prepare for 
natural disasters, including wildfires and the swine flu. In addition, 
last Tuesday, the administration requested proposals to increase the 
borrowing power of the International Monetary Fund. This proposal would 
cost $5 billion under the scoring of the Congressional Budget Office.

After reviewing the President's request, the proposals made by the 
committee and included in the recommendation before you total $91.3 
billion, $1.3 billion above the President's estimate. This amount is 
$5.4 billion below the measure just passed by the House. I would point 
out that the House did not consider the $5 billion request for the IMF 
by the administration.

The President requested funding in four basic areas: national 
defense, international affairs, protection against swine flu, and 
funding in response to natural disasters, all of which I will briefly 
discuss.

The President's request included $73.7 billion for items under the 
jurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee. The committee has provided 
$73 billion for this purpose. The remaining $700 million was requested 
for programs that more appropriately are funded by other subcommittees, 
such as Military Construction; Commerce, Justice, State; and Homeland 
Security. So in this mark, we recommend transferring these funds to the 
relevant subcommittees.

I would note there are several differences between the specific items 
requested and the amounts recommended by the committee. For example, 
the committee recommended $1.9 billion to cover the costs of higher 
military personnel retention and other necessary personnel bills.

We provide an additional $1.55 billion for the purchase of the all-
terrain MRAP vehicle and $500 million for equipment for our National 
Guard and Reserve forces. The committee also addressed the readiness 
needs of the Navy and provides for an increase in the enhancement of 
our intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.

For the Department of State and other international affairs funding, 
including the IMF, the committee recommends $11.9 billion, nearly the 
same as the amount requested. The committee recommendation is similar 
to that requested, but I would note that additional funding has been 
allocated for Jordan and for the Global AIDS Program within the overall 
total.

For military construction, the committee is recommending $2.3 
billion, about the same as that sought by the administration.

The committee has recommended $1.5 billion, as requested, for the 
swine flu, and has worked with the administration to identify the best 
allocation of these resources among the relevant Federal agencies.

Funding of $250 million is recommended for fighting wildfires, and 
$700 million is provided for international food assistance under PL-
480.

The committee has responded to damage caused by natural disasters by 
adding nearly $900 million to the amount requested for damage from 
flooding in the Midwest and in response to Hurricane Katrina.

Each subcommittee was tasked with reviewing the President's request 
in their jurisdiction and recommending funding both for items in the 
request and other items necessary to meet legitimate emergency needs.

The vice chairman, Senator Cochran, and I also offered each 
subcommittee the opportunity to recommend earmarks or other 
nonemergency increases so long as the costs were offset within existing 
funding.

As the Senate considers this bill, I would point out that under the 
budget resolution, any item which seeks to add funding to the bill will 
be subject to a Budget Act point of order unless it is offset.

This is an important bill which responds to the requirements of our 
men and women in uniform and to members of our population who have been 
ravaged by natural disasters. It also seeks to protect our people and 
our country with funding to deter wildfires and the swine flu, in 
addition to terrorists.

This is a good bill. It is necessary to deal with a myriad of 
problems. We should act expeditiously to pass it, get it to conference, 
and on to the President for his signature. Therefore, I join my leaders 
in urging my colleagues to help us attain quick passage of this very 
important measure.

Mr. President, I yield to the vice chairman of the committee.
