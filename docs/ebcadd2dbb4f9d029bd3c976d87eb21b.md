Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill that Bill 
Young and I worked out.

Let me say this to the Members: We did everything we could to work 
this out. We worked diligently. We sent a bill to the White House. They 
vetoed it. We've done everything we could do to change it.

I feel a direction change in the air. I see the Iraqis are starting 
to talk about redeployment. I see the administration starting to talk 
about other countries being involved. I see them asking the U.N. to get 
involved, something that should have happened a long time ago. But the 
point is, I see a new political diplomatic effort which is beginning to 
take effect here that's going to make a big difference.

But, in the meantime, we have to fund the troops. They'll run out in 
the next few weeks. They'll run out of money. There's no question about 
that. We send our staff continually to find out exactly how long it'll 
go. There'll be tremendous problems if we weren't to fund the troops.

And let me say what's in this bill. There's $94 billion for the 
Department of Defense military, and $24 billion of that is for reset 
and re-equipment; $7.7 billion for four critical initiatives; $1.1 
billion for family housing allowances; $1.6 billion for strategic 
reserve readiness. We're trying to change. We're trying to stabilize 
the military.

We've already found with some of the work that we've done a couple of 
billion dollars in contracting that we can use and divert, and Bill 
Young and I were talking about this earlier today; $1.6 billion for 
strategic reserve; $34 billion for MRAP. That's the new vehicle that 
resists the IED attacks. Almost $2 billion in additional funding for 
health care; we have funded the health care that was not funded last 
year. We put extra money in for Walter Reed. We put extra money in for 
care giving. We put extra money in for all kind of things.

But let me just say this: I saw the other day, to show you the kind 
of problem we have, I saw the other day a young fellow who got 20 
percent disability when he got out of the military. And then he went to 
the VA, and he got 100 percent disability. But the point is, he gets no 
health care for his family, and he has four children. So even though he 
gets 100 percent disability and he's taking care of himself, and he'll 
probably be paralyzed at some point because he's getting worse instead 
of better, and these are the kinds of things we're trying to fix.

So we have several problems. First of all, we have the short-term 
problem; we have to take care of the funding for the military for the 
next 4 months. As Chairman Obey says, we need to take care for an extra 
2 months from the original bill we passed.

Then we need to start to work on a nurse shortage. We're looking at 
paying the nurses $25,000 more. We're looking at doctor shortages. We 
are looking at an administrative shortage in the hospital. We, finally, 
Bill Young and I worked, and we got General Casey going to all the 
hospitals finding out what the shortages are. We've got a lot of work 
to do here, and this bill starts us in that direction.

But let me just end this by saying, we're now in a position where I 
see that, by September, we'll be able to judge. When we pass our bill, 
and the 2008 bill will come up as a basic defense bill, then we're 
going to hold the supplemental until September. By that time, we will 
know that the surge is working or not working. And I predict, and I've 
been right in every one of my predictions, that incidents are going to 
continue to increase; oil production will not be above pre-war level; 
and that electricity will not be above pre-war level. And incidents 
will continue to increase, and more and more people will be killed by 
IEDs.

So I do not wish for a bad result, but I see the administration 
finally changing and finally recognizing this can't be won militarily. 
I think we're moving in the right direction.

It's very painful because people are frustrated. They'd like to see 
this thing over overnight. All of us are frustrated. But we have to 
take what we can get, and I think here we have a good bill, as good a 
bill as we could put together.

The two bills put together are good bills. I hope that everybody will 
vote for both bills because one takes care of the troops and the 
funding that's necessary, and the other takes care of all the other, 
the change in direction that we're trying to get in the military.



I would request that all the Members vote for both amendments to the 
bill.
