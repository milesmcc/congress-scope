Mr. BUYER. I rise in opposition to the rule.

Why would the VFW National Commander state that he is furious? 
Because Congress is moving a flawed bill that does not protect 
America's military, dependents, veterans, widows, nor orphans.

The VFW stated, ''The President and the Democrat leadership are 
betraying America's veterans.''

The VFW is asking for a ''no'' vote on this bill because it breaks 
the promises the President made to veterans at their national 
convention. This flawed bill covers neither our military and dependents 
under TRICARE, nor VA programs for widows and orphans, nor the program 
for children of Korea and Vietnam veterans with spina bifida. None of 
these programs are considered minimum essential coverage. And where are 
the protections for the Secretaries of DOD and the VA to preserve the 
integrity of their health care systems? Absent from the bill.

Buck McKeon and I and others tried to fix this bill, but were denied 
by this rule and our suspension efforts, even though Mr. Levin and I 
tried to have an agreement. Many veterans groups support efforts to 
correct these errors. Vote ''no.''

 National Healthcare Bill Betrays Veterans




 Washington.--The national commander of the nation's oldest 


 and largest combat veterans' organization is furious that 


 Congress is moving ahead with a flawed healthcare bill that 


 does not protect the health programs provided to veterans, 


 servicemembers or their families.



 ''The president and the Democratic leadership are betraying 


 America's veterans,'' said Thomas J. Tradewell Sr., a combat-


 wounded Vietnam veteran from Sussex, Wis., who leads the 2.1 


 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. and its 


 Auxiliaries.



 ''And what makes matters worse is the leadership and the 


 president knows the bill is flawed, yet they are pushing for 


 passage today like it's a do-or-die situation. This nation 


 deserves the best from their elected officials, and the rush 


 to pass legislation of this magnitude is not it.''



 At issue is H.R. 4872 does not fully protect the healthcare 


 programs provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and 


 the military's Tricare system. Specifically, the bill covers 


 Tricare For Life but not the other Tricare programs that 


 serve millions of beneficiaries; it does not cover children 


 suffering from spina bifida as a result of a parent's 


 exposure to Agent Orange; and it does not cover dependents, 


 widows and orphans who are served by CHAMPVA, the Civilian 


 Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans 


 Affairs.



 ''The president was very clear at our VFW national 


 convention last year when he said he was going to protect 


 these programs, as did the Democratic leadership in the House 


 and Senate repeatedly throughout the year. Now we have this 


 flawed package that everyone is trying to rush through that 


 blatantly omits any protections of the healthcare programs 


 our nation provides to millions of veterans, military 


 personnel, military retirees, and their families or 


 survivors.



 ''This is Washington doubletalk at its very worse, and the 


 uproar is going to be huge in America's military and 


 veterans' communities,'' said Tradewell, who wants Congress 


 to vote against H.R. 4872 today.



 The issue surfaced publicly Friday when House Armed Service 


 Committee Chairman Ike Skelton (D-Mo.) introduced legislation 


 to explicitly protect Tricare and other Defense Department 


 nonappropriated fund health plans from any health reforms 


 currently under consideration by Congress.



 Yesterday, Reps. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.) and Buck McKeon (R-


 Calif.) tried to introduce an amendment to H.R. 4872 to 


 protect the integrity and independence of the VA and Defense 


 Department healthcare systems. Buyer is the ranking member of 


 the House Veterans Affairs Committee and McKeon is the 


 ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.



 ''The VFW salutes the congressmen and their supporters,'' 


 said Tradewell, ''and I hope their messages were heard loudly 


 and clearly throughout Congress. Healthcare is important, but 


 so is protecting the programs that were promised to our 


 nation's veterans, military and their families,'' he said.



 ''Those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan should not have to 


 worry about their dependents' healthcare programs, but they 


 are today, and so are millions of military retirees, 


 veterans, survivors and children.



 ''Military service is based on the fundamental principle of 


 trust, and once lost, it is virtually impossible to regain,'' 


 said Tradewell. ''That is why I am urging the House to vote 


 'no' today, then go back and fix the bill with the language 


 proposed by Skelton, Buyer and McKeon, and then come back and 


 vote your conscience. Let's not rush to pass flawed 


 legislation that could tremendously impact our nation's true 


 heroes.''
