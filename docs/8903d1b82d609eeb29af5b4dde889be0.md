Mr. MEEK of Florida. That is right. In full effect. You have here 
U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans Healthcare, and Iraq Accountability 
Act. Expanding funding for veterans healthcare and hospitals. What is 
wrong with that? Nothing.

The Bush administration must meet military standards for troop 
readiness. Mr. Ryan, this is the DoD policy as it relates to troop 
readiness. The Congress had nothing to do with the policy. The 
Department of Defense came up with the policy.

So basically what we are saying, Mr. Speaker, through this act, 
follow your policy, because it is in the best interests of the American 
people and the troops that are in harm's way.

What is in that policy? Making sure troops have what they need when 
they are deployed. What else? Making sure we have a military that is 
ready to respond at a moment's notice when we need them. We will go 
deeper into that.
