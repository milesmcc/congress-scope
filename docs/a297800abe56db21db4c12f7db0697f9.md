Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker I rise today in support of H. Res. 
1009, honoring the seven Americans killed in Khost, Afghanistan in a 
suicide attack on December 30, 2009. I extend my sincere condolences to 
their families and friends, as well as to the entire intelligence 
community.

The men and women of the clandestine services face great personal 
danger to protect the United States. Their work is largely done in the 
shadows and seldom do they receive the credit and recognition they so 
deeply deserve. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their courageous 
service.

As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have seen firsthand the 
work these men and women are doing to protect Americans on the 
frontlines of international conflicts. While their names may never be 
made public, their memory and the impact of their service will not be 
forgotten.

The loss of seven American men and women in the December 30th attack 
is a tragedy for both the intelligence community and our country, and 
my thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who were killed.
