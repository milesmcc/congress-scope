Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, this week the House is conducting the most 
important debate of this Congress, whether Members will support the 
President's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq. I oppose the 
President's plan, and during this debate I am hoping that those who 
support the escalation of the war can answer a couple of questions.

First, if the President is allowed to move forward, how do we 
guarantee these troops have the protective armor they need? Earlier 
this month we learned that troop escalation would create logistical 
hurdles for both the Army and Marines, which are already short 
thousands of vehicles and armor kits. Members who support the 
President's plan need to explain how do we provide the troops the 
equipment they need.

Members who support the plan also need to explain where do we come up 
with the additional troops that will be needed to support 21,500 combat 
troops. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates as many 
as 48,000 troops may be required to implement the plan.

Mr. Speaker, these are questions that supporters of escalating the 
war in Iraq should ask before they vote to escalate the war in Iraq.
