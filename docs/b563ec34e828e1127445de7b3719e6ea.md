Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to PFC Shawn 
Falter, who gave his life in service to our Nation on Saturday, January 
20 in Karbala, Iraq.

Shawn grew up in the town of Homer, NY, and was a dedicated and 
loving son, brother and friend to many. As a student at Homer High 
School, Shawn excelled both on the field and in the classroom. He was a 
hard-working student, a natural leader, and a selfless friend who could 
light up a room with impeccable timing.

Shawn enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 2005, following in the 
footsteps of his three older brothers. He was assigned to the 2nd 
Battalion, 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat 
Team, 25th Infantry Division deployed out of Fort Richardson, AK. 
Sadly, Shawn was killed during an ambush in Karbala, Iraq earlier this 
week in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Shawn was truly an exemplary American who served his country bravely. 
Our Nation is blessed to have dedicated, talented men and women like 
Shawn Falter fighting to protect us and others around the world.

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring PFC Shawn 
Falter, along with all of the other brave Americans who have made the 
ultimate sacrifice for our country.
