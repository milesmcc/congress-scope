Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues suggested earlier that 
debating the war as we are today is breaking the will of the American 
people.

On the contrary, it's the people's will that is breaking down the 
wall of a tragically mistaken policy. It has become painfully obvious 
that the White House is incapable of changing course in Iraq.

The Bush administration's talking points about the situation change 
from week to week, but the fundamental strategy remains the same. The 
President has determined our troops will remain in Iraq no matter what. 
The reality is that the government of Iraq is not meeting the 
benchmark.

Six months into the surge, there is no indication that the Iraqis are 
coming together to make the political decisions necessary to end the 
sectarian violence that's tearing the country apart. They are unlikely 
to do so as long as the U.S. military commitment remains open-ended.

We need to change course. Support this bill.
