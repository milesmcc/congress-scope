Mr. GREGG. The Senator has pointed out that we passed none of the 
obligations for operating the Government prior to the beginning of the 
fiscal year. As the Senator pointed out, we have only passed 1 of those 
bills out of the 12. We are now almost 3 months into the fiscal year. 
That happens to be the worst record in the history of the Congress, I 
believe.

That dysfunction of this Congress was not necessary, was it? Did we 
not vote I think almost 60 times on issues involving Iraq, on 
repetitive issues involving Iraq, to the point where the Democratic 
leaders have essentially said: We are going to ignore the operation of 
the day-to-day business of the Government in order to call up 60 votes, 
many of which were simply political votes, and use up the entire 
calendar of the Congress in order to make political points, when they 
knew they were not going to be able to do a great deal in this area 
other than what they should do, which is fund the troops in the field?
