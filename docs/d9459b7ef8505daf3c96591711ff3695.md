Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mitchell Igneri and 
Stephen Clarke of SS. Cyril and Methodius School in Deer Park, NY.

Mitchell Igneri and Stephen Clarke are the second prize winners in C-
SPAN's ''StudentCam'' contest. ''StudentCam'' is a video documentary 
contest which invites middle and high school students to produce a 
video exploring a current political topic using C-SPAN programming. 
Igneri and Clarke won for their video ''War in Iraq: The Current 
Controversy.''

The war in Iraq is a tough issue for young Americans to grapple with 
today, and I would like to acknowledge these students for their 
excellence and creativity in exploring the political realm which 
surrounds our current situation in Iraq. I am proud to have been 
interviewed for this award-winning production.

I congratulate these two students on their achievement and thank them 
for their contribution to our understanding of the war in Iraq.
