Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a young American hero 
who has given his all in service to our Nation, a 1970 graduate of 
Methacton High School, Marc Small of Collegeville, Pennsylvania. He 
represented the very best of our community and country when he decided 
in 2003 to follow in the patriotic footsteps of his father, Sergeant 
Major Murray Small, U.S. Army, Retired, and he enlisted in our U.S. 
Army.

As importantly, in following his mother's compassionate and caring 
nature, he chose to become a medic with the Army Special Forces to 
assume the responsibilities of caring for his comrades in arms as well 
as some of the poorest people on this earth. As testament to his 
intelligence, motivation and courage, in less than 5 years this 
remarkable young man quickly rose to the rank of staff sergeant, 
learned the invaluable skills necessary to heal soldiers and civilians 
and earned the extraordinary honor of wearing the treasured ''Green 
Beret.''

Tragically, on February 12, 2009, at Faramuz, Afghanistan, Staff 
Sergeant Marc J. Small, of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group 
(Airborne) U.S. Army, succumbed to wounds sustained in combat. Before 
his life was cut short, this young warrior had treated hundreds of 
Afghani civilians and in the process displayed the very best of the 
American spirit and character.

By the loss of Staff Sergeant Marc J. Small we are a much lesser 
Nation and community, but only for the briefest of periods. Because 
given the very special nature of this healer and warrior, I am certain 
that from this tragedy other young men and women will be inspired by 
the heroism and selflessness of Staff Sergeant Small. From their 
skills, valor and compassion, the best traditions of our Nation will 
live on, as they must, for this world remains a very challenging place, 
and the need for our Nation to tend to the needs of poor and oppressed 
in many remote regions of the world is great.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that we take a moment to reflect on the service 
Staff Sergeant Marc Small has made on our


behalf in making so much possible. We thank his mother, Mary 
MacFarland; his father, Sergeant Major Murray Small, U.S. Army, 
Retired; his stepfather, Peter MacFarland; his stepmother, Karen Small; 
his brother, Matt; sisters Heather MacFarland Wellock, Jennifer 
MacFarland and Megan MacFarland; stepbrothers Travis and Tyler Baney; 
and Amanda Charney, who Marc Small very deeply loved.

I join all of the constituents of Pennsylvania's Seventh 
Congressional District and good Americans everywhere when I pledge that 
the service and sacrifice of Staff Sergeant Marc J. Small, U.S. Army, 
will always be remembered and forever honored.
