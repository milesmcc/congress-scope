Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, for months now, economic experts have 
been warning that our economy was in trouble. After some disturbing 
signs about job losses in this country, the President finally came out 
and made some comments saying that there were ''mixed signals'' about 
the state of the economy.

These are not mixed signals about the state of the economy, and 
Americans understand. Americans know they are having more trouble 
paying for their mortgages, having trouble paying for their heating 
bills, having trouble paying for their gas, having trouble paying for 
all the costs of living in America right now.

The President should not continue to call these signs ''mixed 
signals,'' should acknowledge that we have some problems, and work in a 
bipartisan manner to straighten this out.

He might also wonder what impact the war in Iraq is having as we pour 
billions of dollars into Iraq and take the money from our own people 
and then borrow the money to continue the fight in Iraq. He might ask 
himself if this, too, is hurting our economy.

I ask the President to work with us to find answers for America's 
working people.
