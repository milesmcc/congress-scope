`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 1 July 2010`

---


Mr. KUCINICH. Just a few days before his dismissal, General 
McChrystal wrote what has been described as a devastating report on his 
mission. He pointed out that he faced a resilient and growing 
insurgency with too few troops, and he expected no progress in the 
coming months. Why are we continuing to send our troops into a mission 
impossible? Why are we committing our troops to a situation which is 
certainly bound to bring about more casualties, both of our troops and 
innocent civilians?

General Petraeus is promising an escalation of the war which will put 
more American lives on the line and more innocent civilians killed. Do 
we support our troops? If we do, and if we really paid attention to 
what's going on in Afghanistan, if we really supported our troops, we'd 
bring them home. And that's exactly what the Barbara Lee amendment is 
designed to do, and that's why we should support it.

As related by William Polk in his recent article in 
''Counterpunch''--Just a few days before his dismissal, General 
McChrystal wrote what has been described as a ''devastating report on 
his mission.'' He pointed out that he faced a ''resilient and growing 
insurgency'' with too few troops and he expected no progress in the 
coming months.

Why are we continuing to send our troops into a mission impossible? 
Why are we committing our troops to a situation which is certainly 
bound to bring about more casualties, both of our troops and innocent 
civilians? General Petraeus is promising an escalation of the war which 
will put more American lives on the line and more innocent civilians 
killed.

Do we support our troops? If we do, and if we really paid attention 
to what's going on in Afghanistan, if we really supported our troops we 
would bring them home. That's exactly what the Barbara Lee Amendment is 
designed to do, and that's why we should support it.
















 What Now?














 Afghanistan Sitrep














(By William R. Polk)




 On June 24, the International Herald Tribune published an 


 editorial from its parent, The New York Times, entitled 


 ''Obama's Decision.'' Both the attribution--printing in the 


 two newspapers which ensures that the editorial will reach 


 both directly and through subsidiary reprinting almost every 


 ''decision maker'' in the world--and the date--just before 


 the appointment of David Petraeus to succeed Stanley 


 McChrystal--are significant. They could have suggested a 


 momentary lull in which basic questions on the Afghan war 


 might have been reconsidered.



 That did not happen. The President made clear his belief 


 that the strategy of the war was sound and his commitment to 


 continue it even if the general responsible for it had to be 


 changed.



 The editorial sounded a different note arising from the 


 events surrounding the fall of General McChrystal: Mr. Obama, 


 said The Times, ''must order all of his top advisers to stop 


 their sniping and maneuvering'' and come up with a coherent 


 political and military plan for driving back the Taliban and 


 building a minimally effective Afghan government.''



 In short, Mr. Obama must get his team together and evolve a 


 plan.



 Unfortunately, the task he faces is not that simple.



 First, consider the ''team.'' It has two major components, 


 the military officers whom McChrystal gathered in Kabul. As 


 they made clear in the Rolling Stone interview, they think of 


 themselves as ''Team America'' and hold in contempt everyone 


 else. Those who don't fully subscribe to their approach to 


 the war are unpatriotic, stupid or cowardly. Those officers 


 are not alone. Agreeing with them is apparently now a large 


 part of the professional military establishment. They are the 


 junior officers whom David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal 


 have selected, promoted and with whom they take their stand.



 The other ''component'' is not a group but many groups with 


 different agendas and constituencies. The most crucial for my 


 purposes here are the advisers to the President; they were 


 dismissed out of hand as ''the wimps in the White House.'' 


 Most, but not all, were civilians. Other senior military 


 officers, now retired, who are not part of ''Team America'' 


 and its adherents were also disparaged. Famously, General Jim 


 Jones, the director of the National Security Council staff, 


 was called a ''clown.''



 These were the comments that forced Mr. Obama's hand and 


 were what the press latched upon to explain the events. But 


 many missed the point that McChrystal had just a few days 


 before his dismissal written a devastating report on his 


 mission. Confidential copies of it were obtained by the 


 London newspaper, The Independent on Sunday, which published 


 it today, but of course




 the President had seen it earlier. Essentially, its message 


 boiled down to failure.



 McChrystal pointed out that he faced a ''resilient and 


 growing insurgency,'' with too few troops and expected no 


 progress in the coming six months. Despite expenditures of at 


 least $7 billion a month, his politico-military strategy 


 wasn't working. Within weeks of the ''victory'' over the 


 Taliban in the agricultural district of Marja, the Taliban 


 were back and the box full of government he had announced 


 proved to be nearly empty. As the expression went in the days 


 of the Vietnam war, whatever happened during the day, the 


 guerrillas ''owned the night.'' As he described it, Marja was 


 the ''bleeding ulcer'' of the American campaign.



 Behind McChrystal's words, the figures were even more 


 devastating: Marja, despite the descriptions in the press is 


 not a town, much less a city; it is a hundred or so square 


 miles of farm land with dispersed hamlets in which about 


 35,000 people live and work. Into that small and lightly 


 populated area, McChrystal poured some 15,000 troops, and 


 they failed to secure it.



 To appreciate what those figures mean, consider them in 


 context of Petraeus's counterinsurgency theory, on which 


 McChrystal was basing his strategy. As he had explained it, 


 Marja should be taken, secured and held. Then an 


 administration--McChrystal's ''government in a box''--should 


 be imposed upon it. Despite all the hoopla about the 


 brilliant new strategy, it was hardly new. In fact it was a 


 replay of the strategy the French General Lyautey called the 


 tache d'huile (the oil spot) and applied in Indochina over a 


 century ago. We also tried it in Vietnam, renaming it the 


 ''ink spot.'' The hope was that the ''spot,'' once fixed on 


 the Marja, would smudge into adjoining areas and so 


 eventually spread across the country. Clear and simple, but 


 unfortunately, like so much in counterinsurgency theory, it 


 never seemed to work.



 Petraeus's counterinsurgency theory also illuminated how to 


 create the ''spot.'' What was required was a commitment of 


 forces in proportion to native population size. Various 


 numbers have been put forth but a common number is about one 


 soldier for each 50 inhabitants. Marja was the area chosen 


 for the ''spot.'' The people living there, after all, were 


 farmers, wedded to the land, and so should be more tractable 


 than the wild warriors along the tribal frontier. Moreover, 


 it was the place where the first significant American aid 


 program, the Helmand Valley Authority, had been undertaken in 


 the late 1950s. So, if an area were to be favorable to 


 Americans, it ought to be Marja. But, to take no chances, 


 General McChrystal decided to employ overwhelming force. So, 


 what is particularly stunning about the failure in Marja is 


 that the force applied was not the counterinsurgency model of 


 1 soldier for each 50 inhabitants but nearly 1 soldier for 


 each 2 inhabitants.



 If these numbers were projected to the planned offensive in 


 the much larger city of Kandahar, which has a population of 


 nearly 500,000, they become impossibly large. Such an attack 


 would require at least four times as many U.S. and NATO as in 


 Marja. That is virtually the entire fighting force and what 


 little control over Marja and most other areas, perhaps 


 even the capital, Kabul, that now exists would have to be 


 given up or else large numbers of additional American 


 troops would have to be engaged. Moreover, in response to 


 such an attack, it would be possible for the insurgents 


 also to redeploy so the numbers would again increase.



 The more fundamental question, which needs to be addressed, 


 is why didn't this relatively massive introduction of troops 


 with awesome and overwhelming fire power succeed. Just a few 


 days before he was fired, as I have mentioned, General 


 McChrystal posed, but could not answer, that question. I hope 


 President Obama is also pondering it.



 For those who read history, the answer is evident. But, as 


 I have quoted in my book Understanding Iraq, the great German 


 philosopher, Georg Willhelm Friedrich Hegel, despaired that 


 ''Peoples and governments never have learned anything from 


 history or acted on principles deduced from it'' and, 


 therefore, as the American philosopher George Santayana 


 warned us, not having learned from history, we are doomed to 


 repeat it. Indeed, it seems that each generation of Americans 


 has to start all over again to find the answers. Who among 


 our leaders and certainly among college students now really 


 remembers Vietnam? So, consider these simple facts:



 The first fact, whether we like it or not, is that nearly 


 everyone in the world has a deep aversion to foreigners on 


 his land. As far as we know, this feeling goes back to the 


 very beginning of our species because we are territorial 


 animals. Dedication to the protection of homeland permeates 


 history. And the sentiment has never died out. Today we call 


 it nationalism. Nationalism in various guises is the most 


 powerful political idea of our times. Protecting land, 


 culture, religion and people from foreigners is the central 


 issue in insurgency. The former head of the Pakistani 


 intelligence service, who has had unparallelled experience 


 with the Taliban over many years, advised us that we should 


 open our eyes to seeing the Afghan insurgents as they see 


 themselves: ''They are freedom fighters fighting for their 


 country and fighting for their faith.'' We agreed when they 


 were fighting the Russians; now, when many of the same people 


 are fighting us, we see them only as terrorists. That label 


 does not help us understand why they are fighting.



 Instead of asking why they are fighting, counterinsurgents 


 think they can overcome aversion to foreign invaders by 


 ''renting'' the natives. In Marja, we not only put in a large 


 military contingent but, as Rajiv Chandrasekaran reported 


 this month in The Washington Post, we offered to employ 


 virtually the entire adult population, some 10,000 people. 


 Unquestionably such efforts do persuade some of the people 


 for some of the time. But not all or permanently. In Marja, 


 only 1,200 people signed up for the jobs we offered.



 Why so few? After all, the Afghans, as I wrote in an 


 earlier article, have suffered through virtually continuous 


 war for thirty years. Many are wounded or sick, with some 


 even on the brink of starvation. More than one in three 


 subsists on the equivalent of less than 45 cents a day, 


 almost one in two lives below the poverty line and more than 


 one in two preschool children is stunted because of 


 malnutrition. They are the lucky ones; one in five dies 


 before the age of 5. Obviously, the Afghans need help, so we 


 think they should welcome our efforts to aid them. But Marja 


 shows that they do not. Nation-wide, independent observers 


 have found that attitude is common: most do not want us 


 there, even giving them aid. And even those who do are fairly 


 easily dissuaded by the insurgents.



 Threats or attacks by the insurgents have brought them into 


 our gunsights. In Afghanistan, as in Vietnam, we have tried 


 to so weaken the insurgents that they cannot effectively 


 block our programs. Our ''body counts'' in Vietnam showed 


 that we killed off the entire Viet Minh several times over 


 and today we are told that the ranks of the Taliban have been 


 severely depleted. But, because the motivation that energized 


 the first group of insurgents is widely shared, and is 


 usually intensified by foreign military action, which by its 


 nature is regarded by many of the natives as unjustified and 


 brutal, new insurgents as well as supporters of the 


 temporarily evicted insurgents will emerge from among the 


 inhabitants of the oil/ink spot. Outsiders may have come in, 


 but, according to U.S. military intelligence about three in 


 four insurgents fight within five miles of their homes. They 


 were ''home'' and taking up arms within a month in Marja.



 Indeed, the campaign may have been, to use that cumbersome 


 locution of governmentese, ''counter-productive.'' According 


 to the former British counter-terrorism chief and current 


 head of the U.N. monitoring mission, Richard Barnett, as 


 cited in The Guardian/The Observer last week, ''Attempts by 


 British and American forces to expand their control over 


 Afghan territory over the past 12 months have been counter-


 productive and led to a worsening security situation.''



 The second fact is that those insurgents who don't get 


 killed are the ones who have learned three simple ways to 


 defeat the counterinsurgents.



 The first of these ways to defeat counterinsurgents is to 


 use appropriate tactics--never stand and fight. Insurgents 


 can see that their enemies outgun, and usually far out-


 number, them so they should hit and run--lay mines, ambush 


 patrols, disrupt logistics but never get caught. Drawing on a 


 Kenyan fable, this has been termed ''the war of the flea and 


 the lion.'' The flea bites and jumps away. The powerful lion 


 swats, occasionally hits, but eventually tires and moves 


 away. Lions don't defeat fleas.



 The second way insurgents can defeat the counterinsurgent 


 is a form of jujitsu--using his strength against him. His 


 strength is his superiority in weapons. So the insurgent 


 seeks to incite him to use them. Inevitably, caught in the 


 middle, the people--who are after all the ''spoil'' in 


 insurgency warfare--get hurt. And when they get hurt, they 


 naturally come to hate those who fire the weapons. In 


 Vietnam, insurgents would sometimes enter a ''neutral'' 


 village, shoot at an American airplane and then steal away. 


 The attacked airplane would call in troops or gunships. The 


 villagers would suffer and would be confirmed in their hatred 


 of the Americans. It was brutal but very effective.



 Counterinsurgents think they can avoid this problem by 


 withholding as much as possible of their lethal power. But 


 doing so is very difficult. Their soldiers also get hurt and 


 angry. And they come to hate the locals--wogs, gooks, rag 


 heads, untermenschen--who appear to them dirty, slovenly, 


 corrupt and cowardly. No one can be trusted when even 


 children act as spies or carry bombs. Soldiers make bad 


 neighbors to civilians in the best of circumstances and 


 insurgency is not one of those circumstances. As I have 


 pointed out in my book, The Birth of America, it was the 


 presence of even superbly disciplined British troops in 


 Boston that touched off the American Revolution.



 The third way insurgents can defeat invaders is by 


 destroying their local puppets. Ruling another country is, of 


 course, expensive and difficult so foreigners have almost 


 always and everywhere enrolled willing natives to help. In 


 the American Revolution we called those people ''the 


 Loyalists.'' In Vietnam, they were the government of the 


 South. In Afghanistan they are the ''Kabul government.''



 So the insurgents regard collaborators--''Quislings'' as we 


 called them in the Second World War--as their prime target. 


 In America, the colonists threatened, tarred and feathered, 


 lashed, imprisoned, hanged or drove away tens of thousands of 


 the Loyalists. In Vietnam, French police records show




 that in the 1950s, the Viet Minh virtually wiped out the 


 administration of the southern government, murdering 


 policemen, postmen, judges and other civil servants as well 


 as teachers and doctors. And today in Afghanistan, as Rod 


 Nordland reported in The New York Times on June 10, ''The 


 Taliban have been stepping up a campaign of assassinations in 


 recent months against officials and anyone else associated 


 with local government in an attempt to undermine 


 counterinsurgency operations in the south.''



 One Afghan told Nordland, ''I know many people who are 


 afraid to take jobs with the government or the aid community 


 now. It's a very effective and very efficient campaign; the 


 armed opposition are using this tool because it works.'' Even 


 from a nationalist perspective, this is very rough justice. 


 But many Afghans appear to believe it is both ''justice'' and 


 Afghan justice.



 To validate their actions, the insurgents must themselves 


 supply what the foreigners and their local supporters offer. 


 We have full records of how insurgents did this in Yugoslavia 


 and Greece during the Second World War. The records are not 


 so open for Afghanistan as yet. But, we know from a study by 


 the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) that the 


 Taliban has set up a ''widespread paramilitary shadow 


 government . . . in a majority of Afghanistan's 34 


 provinces.''



 One of the things these shadow governments do is administer 


 the law. For years, I have read reports contrasting what 


 happens in a government court and a Taliban court. In the 


 government court, cases languish for months or years while 


 bribes are collected. A U.N. study found earlier this year 


 that officials shake down their fellow citizens for an amount 


 that is nearly a quarter of the country's gross domestic 


 product. In a Taliban court, there is no bribery and no 


 delay: Islamic law as defined by Afghan custom is immediate. 


 From our point of view, this too is very rough justice, if 


 justice at all, but in insurgencies, people appear willing to 


 put aside the niceties of peaceful life. In our Revolution we 


 did too.
