Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to express my sympathy over the 
loss of Marine Cpl Michael W. Ouellette, a 29-year-old native of 
Manchester, NH. Corporal Ouellette died on March 22, 2009, as a result 
of injuries sustained from an improvised explosive device while on foot 
patrol in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. Another marine was 
killed in the attack and two others were injured.

Corporal Ouellette graduated from Memorial High School in Manchester 
in 1999. He joined the Marines in June 2005 and was trained as an 
infantryman. He served two terms in Iraq, deploying there in March 2006 
and again in July 2007. He began his third tour overseas when he 
deployed to Afghanistan in November 2008. Ouellette was assigned to the 
3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine 
Expeditionary Force out of Camp Lejeune, NC.

Corporal Ouellette served with honor and distinction throughout his 
highly decorated military career. He received a number of awards for 
his duty, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Combat Action 
Ribbon, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War 
on Terrorism Service Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the Iraq 
Campaign Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.

New Hampshire is proud of Corporal Oullette's service to and 
sacrifice for our country. He, and the thousands of brave men and women 
of the U.S. Armed Forces serving today, deserve America's highest honor 
and recognition.

Corporal Ouellette is survived by his parents, Donna and Leonard 
Ouellette, as well as a brother, Alan, and a sister, Stephanie. He will 
be missed dearly by all those who knew him.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring U.S. 
Marine Cpl Michael Ouellette.
