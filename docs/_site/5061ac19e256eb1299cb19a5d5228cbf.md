`Mr. LAUTENBERG â€” 15 February 2008`

---

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, another 2 months have passed, 
and more American troops lost their lives overseas in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. It is only right that we take time in the Senate to honor 
them.

19, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 79 troops. They lost their 
lives in Iraq and in Operation Enduring
