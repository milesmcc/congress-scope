# VOTE EXPLANATION
## `8574b5edc15d0c7a1129bea29284320b`
`Mr. DOMENICI â€” 24 September 2007`

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was unable to cast a vote on Friday, 
September 21, on amendment No. 2898 to the Defense authorization bill. 
I have voted against similar measures in the past, and had I been 
available to vote on Friday, I would have again voted against this 
attempt to direct a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.

The terms of this amendment would have required U.S. troops to begin 
leaving Iraq within 90 days of the Defense authorization bill's 
enactment and complete that withdrawal within 9 months. While I 
understand public frustration with the war, I believe a precipitous and 
arbitrary withdrawal mandated by Congress is not a wise solution to the 
situation in Iraq. I cannot support attempts to set an arbitrary 
deadline for withdrawing our forces from Iraq, which endangers our 
troops, our safety at home and the overall stability of Iraq and the 
Middle East.

I believe our military commanders should determine how and when our 
troops begin leaving Iraq based on conditions on the ground. General 
Petraeus announced this month that he would be able to begin 
withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. I believe Congress should rely on 
the guidance and leadership of General Petraeus and our other 
commanders on the ground to determine how best to eventually bring our 
troops home from Iraq.
