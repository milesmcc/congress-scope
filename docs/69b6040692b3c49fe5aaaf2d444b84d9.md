Mr. REID. Mr. President, he is going to have all day to talk. He has 
the right to object, and he did that. We listened to his statement.

We believe the American people were entitled to have 2 days, at least 
2 days of debate on the Levin-Reed amendment to change the course in 
Iraq. He may disagree. I would bet, with all due respect to my friend, 
the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, that the people of Pennsylvania 
want a change of course in the intractable war in which we find 
ourselves in Iraq.
