# THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE SCHIP EXTENSION

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, the deed is done. The President just 
vetoed the Children's Health Insurance Program. He is asking for $190 
billion for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and yet vetoed $35 billion 
that would provide health care to 10 million low-income American 
children over the next 5 years.

Let's be perfectly clear. The President is refusing to spend $7 
billion a year on children's health while insisting on $10 billion a 
month in Iraq. The President and Republicans in Congress say that we 
can't afford this bill, but where were the fiscal conservatives when 
the President demanded hundreds of billions of dollars for the war in 
Iraq? He along with many of the Republicans in Congress are willing to 
throw these hundreds of billions of dollars into a disastrous war, and 
yet when it comes to providing health care to children, they say we 
don't have the money.

The truth is we do have the money and, in fact, the children's health 
bill is fully paid for, unlike the half a trillion dollars we have 
already spent on this war.

It is time for us to say you are either for covering uninsured 
American children or you are with a President who prefers to spend this 
money on an endless war.
