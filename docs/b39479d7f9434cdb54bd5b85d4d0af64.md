Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it has now been 20 days since the law that 
allows us to collect foreign intelligence abroad has lapsed. We are 
without the authority we need to collect intelligence against our 
terrorist enemy. The law expired February 16. The Senate passed a bill, 
a bipartisan bill, with 68 Senators voting yes, Democrats and 
Republicans. It was fashioned by the Intelligence Committee which 
passed it 13 to 2, a wide bipartisan margin, clearly a consensus that 
the United States must have authority for intelligence collection 
against our terrorist enemies. We passed that bill, sent it to the 
House of Representatives hoping that the House would act quickly, send 
it to the President for signature so we could get on with this 
important aspect of the war against terror. So far the House of 
Representatives leadership has not brought the bill to the floor of the 
House; this notwithstanding the fact that it clearly would pass. We 
know, because of letters Members of the House of Representatives have 
written to their leadership, that Democrats and Republicans together 
have more than enough votes to pass this legislation we in the Senate 
passed. Yet the House leadership sits on its hands.

Three weeks ago the House leadership said it needed 3 weeks to get 
the job done. That 3 weeks expires Sunday. But the House is not even in 
session now. So today I rise to urge our House colleagues and 
especially the House leadership to step to the plate and pass this 
foreign intelligence surveillance act reauthorization to enable us to 
collect intelligence.

I am going to, at the conclusion of my remarks, ask unanimous consent 
to put a variety of things in the Record. But I am going to refer to 
them now and talk a little bit about why this is so important.

Let's start by stating the premise on which I think we all agree. 
This is something that does not divide Democrats and Republicans. We 
have some divisions about the war against terror. We have some 
divisions about the war in Iraq. But all of us understand, first and 
foremost, you defeat terrorists with good intelligence. You find out 
what they are up to, and you are, therefore, better able to stop their 
plans before they are able to execute them.

Without this intelligence, bad things happen. We did not have the 
intelligence we needed before 9/11, and we all know what happened. 
Since then, a lot of changes have been made. Among other things, we 
have made changes to the law that enables us to collect intelligence 
abroad. As a result of all of those changes, we have not had an attack 
on the homeland.

God forbid we should have such an attack, but if we did, the new 9/11 
Commission--whatever that would be called--would point the finger 
directly at the leadership of the House of Representatives for not 
reauthorizing this intelligence collection because every day that goes 
by we are losing important intelligence.

As we found out through the 9/11 Commission after that fateful day, 
we failed to see things we could have known about that might have 
prevented us from suffering that attack on 9/11. But because of the law 
that existed at the time, because of the wall that existed between the 
CIA and the FBI, for example, they were not able to share this 
information. As a result, we were not able to intercept two of the 
hijackers.

Well, now, today we have a situation where the law that enables us to 
collect this foreign intelligence has expired. There are two problems 
with that expiration. The first is that every day that goes by new 
intelligence is not being collected. You could have a terrorist in 
Afghanistan calling a terrorist in Germany, plotting some action 
against the United States, and because the call happened to be routed 
through a U.S. connection of some kind the law would not enable us to 
collect that intelligence. So every day we are losing intelligence.

Secondly, because the telecommunications companies that help us in 
this effort have been sued by trial lawyers, we need to provide 
protection against these lawsuits. If we do not, there will come a 
time, in my opinion, that it will be very difficult for these 
telecommunications companies to continue to cooperate with the U.S. 
Government. Then, no matter what kind of law we passed, we would not 
have the support of the only folks who can help us collect this 
intelligence. So we need this legislation, and the House of 
Representatives needs to act soon.

There was recently an op-ed that was written by Senator Kit Bond and 
Representatives Pete Hoekstra and Lamar Smith. It occurred in the Wall 
Street Journal on February 26. They point out, in this op-ed, that the 
intercept of these terrorist communications ''requires the cooperation 
of our telecommunications companies. They're already being sued for 
having cooperated with the government after 9/11.'' They go on to say:




 So without explicit protection for future actions (and 


 civil liability protection for the help they provided in the 


 past), those companies critical to collecting actionable 


 intelligence could be sidelined in the fight.


They go on to say:




 It has already happened, briefly.


They quote Director of Intelligence Mike McConnell and Attorney 
General Michael Mukasey saying:




 [W]e have lost intelligence information . . . as a direct 


 result of [this] uncertainty.


So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this article, dated 
February 26, 2008, be printed in the Record.
