Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1661, 
to honor the lives of the brave and selfless humanitarian aid workers, 
doctors, and nurses who died in the tragic attack of August 5, 2010, in 
northern Afghanistan, one of whom was my constituent, Dr. Thomas Grams.

Dr. Grams practiced dentistry in Durango, Colorado, for many years.

Several years ago, he retired from private practice so that he could 
dedicate his life fulltime to the assistance of residents in developing 
countries.

Dr. Grams took countless trips to India, Nepal, and Afghanistan to 
provide care for the indigent residents of these countries.

The focus of Dr. Grams' life was to provide service to others and his 
mission was to provide access to dental and health care in some of the 
most remote corners of the world.

Dr. Grams represented Western Colorado and his entire nation with 
honor.

He exemplified what is best in our country, a strong sense of 
compassion paired with the will and ability to help those in need.

Dr. Grams' passion for service will be sincerely missed in both 
Durango and around the world by those he helped.

Our Nation and our world have lost a strong voice for compassion and 
healing.

In honor of Dr. Grams' legacy, as well as those who were lost with 
him, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 1661.
