Mr. SHAYS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for introducing this 
resolution.

It is a pretty stunning to think that the United States, with all its 
obligations around the world, has to step into the void and provide 70 
percent of all the funding, in spite of the fact that Europe has a 
gross domestic product basically equal to the United States and a 
population greater than the United States.

Given that Europe isn't doing the heavy lifting it needs to do in 
Afghanistan and wants nothing to do with Iraq, you would think at least 
in Darfur Europe would say we should provide far more assistance.

And what about wealthy Middle East countries that would have the 
capacity in a heartbeat to provide all the money necessary, why aren't 
they stepping in as well?

In my only visit to Darfur, I get down on my knees in gratitude to 
the non-government organizations that are there to distribute the food, 
paid for in large measure by the United States; providing education to 
young people so when they can eventually go back to their homes they 
will not have lost 3, 4, or 5 years.

This is genocide in Darfur. Europe doesn't want to acknowledge it. 
The United Nations wants to be silent about it, but this is the wiping 
out of people.

We need to be there providing the assistance for domestic help, the 
financial aid that needs to be provided for not just food and education 
but for the troops who are trying to maintain security. I appreciate 
that Africa is waking up to this need, willing to send more troops, but 
they need the equipment to make sure that they can do the job they have 
to do.

This is a human tragedy of gigantic proportions. I appreciate those 
in the United States, particularly in our universities, that have been 
pushing this issue, and frankly, many in the Jewish community who have 
stepped up and said ''never again'' applies to what happens in Africa.

The world community needs to wake up and do more. The United States 
can't do everything.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1351, a resolution 
expressing support for the United Nations African Union Mission in 
Darfur, UNAMID, and calling upon United Nations Member States and the 
international community to contribute the resources necessary to ensure 
the success of UNAMID.

The attack on the UNAMID peacekeepers is deplorable and I want to 
express my condolences to the family and friends of those killed and 
wounded.

Resolving the crisis in Darfur must be one of our Nation's highest 
priorities.

The world collectively agreed to ''never again'' allow genocide after 
the 1994 mass murders in Rwanda.

Tragically, genocide is again taking place.

I believe the United States must take all reasonable steps to end the 
killing, including pressuring others in the international community to 
do more.

The security, human rights and humanitarian situation in Darfur has 
continued to deteriorate since the Darfur Peace Agreement was signed in 
May 2006.

We must do a better job supporting the mission of the UNAMID who, 
despite being critically under-funded and under-equipped, are serving 
an important role in protecting.

It is also hugely important we continue to provide humanitarian 
assistance to the Darfuri people.

I will continue to advocate for tough sanctions, humanitarian aid, 
and for an international peacekeeping force that can effectively stop 
the violence.
