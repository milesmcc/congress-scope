Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I believe that the Congressional 
hearings, which are appropriate, should now be handled in the same way 
as was done when President Bush was deliberating on a surge strategy 
for Iraq. That is when the President has received his recommendations 
and has made a decision.

We will, at that point, properly have administration officials come 
up to Congress, explain the President's decision. We will hear from our 
military chain of command at that time, including General McChrystal 
but not limited to General McChrystal. We have a Secretary of Defense 
whom we need to hear from. We have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff whom we need to hear from, as well as our CENTCOM commander and 
our Afghanistan commander.

First, we need to be clear on our strategy. I yield myself 5 minutes.
