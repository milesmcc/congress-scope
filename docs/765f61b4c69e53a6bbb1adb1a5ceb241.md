Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in memoriam of Specialist 
Kevin O. Hill, a distinguished and honorable constituent of Brooklyn. 
He died on October 4, 2009 in Dehanna, Afghanistan and was a member of 
the 576th Engineer Company, 4th Engineer Battalion based in Fort 
Carson, Colorado. A third generation Military man, preceded by his 
father, Oslen, Jr. and his grandfather Oslen, Sr., Specialist Hill had 
dreams of being a Secret Service agent and felt that the military 
training and experience could only serve him well in pursuit of that 
goal.

He was a quiet leader, choosing to lead by example more often than 
words. After completing his education at Monroe College, Specialist 
Hill joined the Army. While in Afghanistan he worked with the Engineer 
Battalion to disable IEDs and roadside bombs before they could do harm 
to his fellow soldiers and the civilians that he was there to help.

His mother praised him as a hero, and I stand here to do the same. 
Specialist Hill paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country and my 
condolences go out to his mother, Mahalia Hill, his father, Oslen Hill, 
his grandfather Oslen Hill, Sr., his sisters Chinyere and Shantel and 
his entire family in this time of grave loss. Our country is indebted 
to his family and we are all mourning their loss.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in remembering the 
dedication and selflessness of Specialist Kevin O. Hill.
