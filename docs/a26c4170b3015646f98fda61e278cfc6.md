Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, some Members of Congress 
are proposing legislation that would attempt to develop a new military 
strategy for our troops in Iraq. This meddling by politicians ties the 
hands of our capable military. We should trust in the leadership of GEN 
David Petraeus and not second-guess his efforts to protect American 
families.

Senator Joe Lieberman, former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, 
recently said, ''The fanatics . . . who exhort the tens of thousands to 
shout 'Death to America' . . . don't distinguish between Republicans 
and Democrats . . . and we should have the common sense, let alone the 
sense of responsibility to our country, to come together to defend our 
Nation against those who want to destroy us.''

Failing to secure Iraq will provide a fertile ground for terrorist 
safe havens, threatening America and our allies. Osama bin Laden and 
Zawahiri have both stated that Iraq is a central front in the global 
war on terror. We must stop the terrorists overseas and not face them 
again in the streets of America.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
