`Mr. SHUSTER â€” 19 March 2007`

---


Mr. SHUSTER. I think it is absolutely right, and I think the 
gentleman is right to point out that is really going to be a defining 
moment for many Members of this body, especially our colleagues on the 
other side, who, as you quite eloquently pointed out, that the choice 
is either stay and fight and have a strategy work to help the people of 
Iraq or get out.

So I hope the folks that come down here, and there were some here 
tonight that have come down night after night and for the last several 
months have talked about the need, the desire to get out immediately, 
we are going to see. Are they going to stand up and be true to what 
they have been talking about to the Nation on this House floor for the 
past several months, or are they going to bend to the will of their 
leadership?

As well there are other Members on the other side of the aisle that 
have said they will not stand for micromanagement of the war, they will 
not stand for putting timelines in to give our enemy the ability to 
fight a different kind of war and hurt and kill our soldiers. So this 
is going to be a defining moment.
