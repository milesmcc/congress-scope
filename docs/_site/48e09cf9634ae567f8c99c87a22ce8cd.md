Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

H.R. 6580 is a combination of two good pieces of legislation joined 
together to be pay-as-you-go compliant under our current budget rules. 
The first part of the bill is the Hubbard Act, an important bill 
introduced by my good friend and colleague on the Ways and Means 
Committee, Representative Devin Nunes from California. The second part 
of the bill (H.R. 1264) is a bill that I and Charlie Wilson of Ohio 
introduced to make it easier for individuals to save and to plan for 
their funerals.

Let me begin by commending Representative Nunes for sponsoring and 
for introducing the Hubbard Act. This bill makes an important change to 
the rules governing sole survivorship in the Armed Forces. It's the 
right thing to do. In a moment, you will realize why.

Representative Nunes represents the Hubbard family in California. 
Tragically, this family has lost two sons, Jared and Nathan, to the war 
in Iraq. The remaining son, Jason, left the Army under the sole 
survivor rule, which protects parents from losing all of their children 
to war by permitting the last remaining sibling in combat to return 
home if all other siblings have been killed or have been severely 
injured. This truly is the Saving Private Ryan scenario. After being 
discharged, however, Jason Hubbard was asked to repay significant 
portions of his enlistment bonus; he was denied transition health care, 
and he was told he wasn't eligible for GI benefits even though he had 
already paid into the program.

Currently, there are no standard benefits available to those who 
separate from the Armed Services under the Sole Survivor Policy 
regardless of whether one's service obligation was completed. The 
Hubbard Act will allow those troops who voluntarily separate under the 
sole survivor rule to qualify for the same benefits provided to those 
who involuntarily or who honorably separate from the military. Sole 
survivors of their families who have already made the greatest 
sacrifice should qualify for the benefits that they've earned. This 
bill corrects that. Again, it's the right thing for us to do.

To offset the costs of the Hubbard Act, H.R. 6580 also includes 
language to eliminate the current dollar limitation for qualified 
funeral trusts. Current law limits a funeral trust to just $9,000, but 
this is generally no longer sufficient to cover a family's funeral and 
burial expenses. With this contribution limit, even those who 
responsibly plan for their own funerals often leave their families with 
substantial expenses.

Given that the qualified funeral trusts can only be used for 
specific, limited purposes, I see no reason to place a dollar limit on 
their use. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the bill will 
have a positive impact on the Federal Treasury.

The passage of this legislation is an important step for American 
families and funeral directors, and it would allow for seamless funeral 
and burial planning for families in western Wisconsin and throughout 
the United States.

I hope these two commonsense, bipartisan pieces of legislation 
packaged together will pass this Congress and will move to the 
President's desk swiftly. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6580.

Finally, I would like to offer my thoughts and prayers to the Hubbard 
family. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten. I hope the passage of 
this bill will offer them some solace, will honor their sacrifice and 
will respect their sons' service to our country. May God bless Jared 
and Nathan.

May God also bring a special comfort to those families who have lost 
a loved one while serving our Nation.

I reserve the balance of my time.
