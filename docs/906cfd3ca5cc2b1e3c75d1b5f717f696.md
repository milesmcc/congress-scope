Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.

This an Iraq war and an Afghanistan war supplemental bill to fund the 
troops in harm's way.

Now let me get this straight. The majority has put together a bill 
that will help defeat Islamic extremists in Iraq and Afghanistan by 
funding $283 million worth of pork barrel spending for a milk program, 
a domestic milk program in the United States.

They believe the key to victory in Iraq is setting aside $74 million 
for peanut storehouses in Iraq. No, I'm sorry, not Iraq, Georgia.

They believe they can defeat Islamic extremists by $25 million worth 
of spinach subsidies for United States farmers.

Beyond that, they think that we can fund the war by spending $25 
million for United States livestock. Now, Mr. Speaker, the American 
people know what this is about. This $25 million of livestock is 
literally pork for pork. It is the most ironic thing in this bill.

I would say that the failure of the majority is they don't understand 
''emergency'' and ''war spending.''
