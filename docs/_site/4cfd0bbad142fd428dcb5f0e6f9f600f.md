`Ms. GRANGER â€” 29 June 2007`

---


Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage of one 
of the bravest and most dedicated heroes of our Nation.

Sergeant Bruce Horner was part of the search and recovery operations 
for American soldiers captured by Al Quaida terrorists in southern 
Baghdad when he was killed by an enemy sniper on June 1, 2007.

An 18-year veteran of the Army, Bruce Horner was a proud non-
commissioned officer, mentor and leader to younger soldiers.

He came from a family with a long tradition of military service and 
did not take his responsibilities to lead younger soldiers lightly.

Sergeant Horner is survived by his wife, parents and the soldiers he 
left behind, who are continuing the hard work of protecting our 
Nation's freedoms in Iraq.

SGT. Bruce Horner is gone, but he will never be forgotten.

His memory lives on through the family he left behind and in the 
soldiers that he so ably led.

Our community and Nation honor Sergeant Horner's memory and we are 
grateful for his 18 years of faithful and distinguished service to 
America.
