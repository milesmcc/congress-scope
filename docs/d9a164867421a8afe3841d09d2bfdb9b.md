Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, let me take this means to recognize the 
distinguished


service of Janet Fagan-McNulty, as her career comes to an end. Mrs. 
Fagan-McNulty has spent more than 39 years dedicated to the Department 
of Agriculture and the Department of the Army.

In 1972, Mrs. Fagan-McNulty began her career with the Federal 
Government working for the Department of Agriculture and eventually 
joining Army's Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison. In 1988, 
Mrs. Fagan-McNulty was appointed Deputy Chief of the Congressional 
Inquiry Division tasked with a number of special missions directed by 
the Secretary of the Army, including Operation Quick Look. From these 
successes she was ultimately promoted to Chief of the Congressional 
Inquiry Division.

During her tenure, Mrs. Fagan-McNulty has guided the division and 
organization through numerous major events. Some of these events 
consist of the period during the Cold War, Grenada, Panama, Operations 
Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the tragedy of September 11th, and 
Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom.

Currently, Mrs. Janet Fagan-McNulty is leading a dedicated team as 
Chief of the Congressional Inquiry Division, Office of the Chief of 
Legislative Liaison. I am certain that Members of the House will join 
me in thanking Janet Fagan-McNulty for her commitment and contributions 
to our Nation.
