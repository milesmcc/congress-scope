Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

As it relates to the first item, the GI Bill, there is a 
comprehensive GI Bill, as you know, sponsored by Mr. Webb. Also Ms. 
Herseth over here and others have legislation which tries to respond to 
the critical need that our veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq 
now have because they have substantially less generous benefits and, 
therefore, less opportunity to reintegrate themselves into the 
community and stabilize themselves and their families. We believe that 
is a cost of the war.

I don't believe that under the current suggestion, and I'm not 
suggesting that it's in or out at this point in time, I'm not 
suggesting there is anything in or out in terms of proposal, but it is 
my belief that that would not require a waiver of the PAYGO given the 
context in which it may be considered. What I mean by that, and not to 
be too esoteric, is that we may respond to the need this coming year as 
opposed to a longer term.
