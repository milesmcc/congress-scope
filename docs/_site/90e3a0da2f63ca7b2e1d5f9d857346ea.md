Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. There is room for honest disagreement, 
but to suggest that I in any way said jobs aren't important is simply 
silly. Of course jobs are important. A lot of things are important. The 
war in Iraq is important. Global warming is important. They don't all 
go in the same bill. The gentleman's inability to distinguish between 
what is important and what you try to accomplish in a specific piece of 
legislation is disappointing, although it does not quite reach the 
level of a threat to national security.
