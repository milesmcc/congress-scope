Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, recently six foreign-born extremists, 
inspired by al Qaeda and its preachers of hate, planned to murder U.S. 
troops with semiautomatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. The 
place, not in Iraq, but the United States Army base at Fort Dix in New 
Jersey.

They were knowledgeable and cunning, using one member who delivered 
pizzas on the base to gain intimate knowledge of the fort. They were 
also planning to attack a U.S. Naval installation in Philadelphia.

Before the attack could be unleashed on U.S. troops, the FBI was 
tipped off to their plans, and they were arrested. Not surprisingly, 
three of these terrorists were in the country illegally. Two others had 
green cards.

We are no longer a safe nation. The dangers of our security are real. 
We discuss in Congress the war against extreme radicals, but it starts 
with securing the borders. Because crossing unsecured U.S. borders is 
very easy. It brings the good, the bad, and the ugly. Because all three 
groups know that, for political reasons, the Federal Government refuses 
to protect American citizens by securing our sovereignty.

And that's just the way it is.
