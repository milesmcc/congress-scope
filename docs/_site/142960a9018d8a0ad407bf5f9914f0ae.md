Mr. SALAZAR. May I ask a question? You have some figures on this 
chart that show that basically through the Iraqi war supplementals we 
have actually budgeted $378.5 billion. Could I ask the gentleman, is 
this really the true cost of the war, or is this just what we budgeted 
through the supplementals?
