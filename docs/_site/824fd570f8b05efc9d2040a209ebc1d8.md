`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 22 May 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to put in the record the 
extraordinary story that was in the Washington Post today, ''First 
Called to Duty, Then Citizenship,'' about green card workers, members 
of the Armed Forces. We have 70,000 who are in Iraq and Afghanistan. So 
many of them are working toward earning their citizenship and defending 
America. It is a great story. I ask unanimous consent that it be 
printed in the Record.
