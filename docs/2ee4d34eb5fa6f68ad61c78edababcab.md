Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, time is not on our side. Today's Washington 
Post reports that Iran has learned how to make virtually every bolt and 
switch in a nuclear weapon. It is mastering the technology to enrich 
uranium which would fuel that weapon. A secret nuclear facility located 
on an Iranian military base was recently revealed. For years, Iran has 
been slapping away all of our diplomatic overtures. ''Our outreach has 
produced very little.'' Secretary Clinton's words, not mine.

Today, the world's top terrorist state has its tentacles throughout 
the region. Its tentacles are Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Afghanistan, 
Syria, Sudan. Its agents and proxies are practically everywhere in its 
aspiration for regional dominance, not to mention our own backyard. 
Tomorrow's nuclear Iran would have a compounding effect with severe 
consequences for regional security and for U.S. security. The time for 
action is long past. This bill would help address this threat, 
targeting the regime's Achilles' heel.

But we need a broad-based Iran policy that focuses not just on Iran's 
nuclear program, but one that aims to protect the U.S. and our allies 
from the Iranian missile threat and speaks out against its human rights 
abuses and bolsters its democracy supporters.

Disturbingly, this administration has backed away from missile 
defense in Europe and the democratic movement inside Iran. The 
administration must realize that promoting democracy in Iran and 
improving our national security go hand-in-hand.

I would just mention that sanctions helped bring down apartheid in 
South Africa and ended the South African program to develop nuclear 
weapons.

As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, 
and Trade, I strongly support the passage of this legislation, of which 
I am an original cosponsor.
