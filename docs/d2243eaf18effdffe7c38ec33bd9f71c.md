Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to 
recognize and welcome Major Matthew P. Franke as a chaplain who serves 
God and country with devotion, dedication, and honor.

Among his stations over his 14-year military career, he provided 
pastoral ministry and counseling across Iraq and Kuwait to more than 
600 members of the Air Force serving with Army and Marine units in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom at Balad, Iraq.

He currently works in our office, the Fourth Congressional District 
of South Carolina, where he serves with distinction as a legislative 
liaison fellow, and we are privileged to have gotten to know him over 
the course of this year.

His family continues to live in Wyoming. He and his wife Martha have 
three sons, Micah, Joshua, and Jacob, and a particularly beautiful 
daughter, Rachel.

We very much appreciate his service in the Fourth Congressional 
District of South Carolina.
