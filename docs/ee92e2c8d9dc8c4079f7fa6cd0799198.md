Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise 
today in opposition to the Progressive Caucus budget.

This debate today could be described as a debate about the good, the 
bad, and the ugly. A kinder way you could describe it is the 
responsible, the irresponsible, and the reckless.

We are going to have the House Republican budget brought forward on 
this floor today, brought forward by our chairman, Mr. Ryan, a 
responsible budget, a good budget, a budget that comes to balance in 5 
years without raising taxes and tries to address the challenge that we 
face in the category of entitlements.

We have the Democrat leadership budget that is going to be brought 
forward, a budget that has the biggest tax increase in our Nation's 
history, and a budget, I might add, that not only includes significant 
increases in spending, but as well makes no effort to deal with the 
challenge of entitlements. I will just quote from the chairman of the 
Federal Reserve, Chairman Bernanke, who said, ''Without early


and meaningful action to address entitlements, the U.S. economy could 
be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the 
cost.''

Now, the budget alternative that we have right now in front of us I 
would describe as the ugly or the reckless or the completely 
irresponsible, because not only does it include the biggest tax 
increase in our Nation's history and significant increases in spending; 
it runs up entitlement spending even further. And the part that I think 
is the most egregious, it actually calls the effort of our brave women 
and men fighting in Afghanistan, fighting in Iraq to establish a beacon 
of liberty in that dark area of the world, it calls that effort the 
single largest waste of taxpayers' money and the biggest current drain 
on the U.S. Treasury today.

I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on this alternative budget and 
vote ''yes'' on the Republican budget.
