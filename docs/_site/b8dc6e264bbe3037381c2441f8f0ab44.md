Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, last week the White House released an 
interim report on Iraq that unfortunately reaffirms what we have known 
for quite some time: The President's troop escalation plan is not 
working and we are desperately in need of a new direction in Iraq.

Since the President announced his surge 6 months ago, we have lost 
600 American troops and spent another $60 billion. And yet by the Bush 
administration's own admission, there is unsatisfactory progress on all 
of the political reconciliation benchmarks announced by the President 
in January.

Mr. Speaker, just days after this report was released, the White 
House once again asked for more time to pursue the President's failed 
strategy. But the American people and this Democratic Congress know 
that more time and lower standards are no substitute for real progress.

It is time for a new direction in Iraq. The House acted last week. 
The Senate has the opportunity this week. They should join us in 
changing course.
