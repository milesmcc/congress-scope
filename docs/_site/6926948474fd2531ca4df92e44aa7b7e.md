Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New 
Jersey.

I rise in support of this bill. I can't believe the argument in 
opposition to this bill, that we should continue to stay the course, 
because this is the policy that has led us in the wrong direction for 
four straight years. This has been the worst foreign policy fiasco in 
American history.

Now we're being told that we're there to fight al Qaeda. There were 
no al Qaeda in Iraq when we went into Iraq. Saddam had nothing to do 
with 9/11. Now there are about 5,000 there out of a population of 26 
million.

We have trained hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Many of them we've 
given them more training than we've given our own troops.

This policy is not worthy of the sacrifice of our troops and their 
military families. It's leading us down a dead-end street. It's time 
that it was changed.

Mr. Speaker, we are told that we need to train the Iraqis more. All 
we are doing is equipping and training them in order to kill each other 
in a civil war that I'm afraid is going to be inevitable.
