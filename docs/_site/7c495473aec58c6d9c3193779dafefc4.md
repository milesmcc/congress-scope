Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, Enough is enough.

I will always support our troops; but not President Bush's losing 
policies.

We've done our job in Iraq. Our brave soldiers took out Saddam, and 
Iraq has held several free elections.

They now have a budget surplus, while we suffer with a budget busting 
deficit. It is time to move our troops away from Iraq, and back after 
our real enemies--Osama bin Laden and his followers.

With three trillion dollars down the drain, President Bush's never 
ending occupation of Iraq will soon be known as the greatest theft in 
human history, driving the United States of America into bankruptcy.

We must put an end to the losing policy of wasteful government 
spending in Iraq, and invest our hard earned tax dollars right here at 
home, as we work together to build a better nation for all of us.
