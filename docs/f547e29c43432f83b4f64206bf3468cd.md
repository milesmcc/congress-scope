Mr. GONZALEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of a real American 
hero, SSG


James S. Clark of Aco 1/17 IN. I ask that this poetic tribute penned by 
Albert Caswell of the Capitol Guide Service, be placed in the Record in 
honor of Staff Sergeant Clark. On October 15, 2009, James lost his leg 
and almost his life, in an IED explosion in Khandahar Afghanistan. Like 
many of our fine sons and daughters, who have been injured, he has, and 
will continue to, inspire us all with his faith, courage and 
determination during his recovery. James plans to move to San Antonio, 
Texas to live with his wife Kae-c and their children Samarra and Izeyah 
and their family to receive treatment. We welcome another great 
American veteran and his family with open arms, to our community of 
heroic heroes--patriots who have served our Nation over the years.
