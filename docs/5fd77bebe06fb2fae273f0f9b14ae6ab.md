`Mr. JONES of North Carolina â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
New Jersey. And I apologize for my voice.

Before I yield time, I want to take just a couple minutes and remind 
the House that, yes, we are here today to talk about resolution 63, but 
to remind the House that why we are in Iraq is the question.

I want to start my comments by sharing with the House that I met with 
a real marine general hero that very few people on the floor know his 
name; his name is General Gregory Newbold. And I want to quote him from 
Time magazine, April 9, 2006, ''Why Iraq Was a Mistake.'' I will be 
brief.

Two senior military officers are known to have challenged Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the planning of the Iraq war. Army General 
Eric Shinseki publicly dissented and found himself marginalized. Marine 
Lieutenant General Greg Newbold, the Pentagon's top operations officer, 
voiced his objections internally and then retired, in part out of 
opposition to the war. Here, for the first time, General Newbold goes 
public with a full-throated critique. I want to quote this to the House 
from General Newbold.

''I was a witness and therefore a party to the action that led us to 
the invasion of Iraq, an unnecessary war. Inside the military family, I 
made no secret of my view that these zealots' rationale for war made no 
sense, and I think I was outspoken enough to make those senior to me 
uncomfortable. But I now regret that I did not more openly challenge 
those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were 
peripheral to the real threat, al Qaeda.''

I mention that, Mr. Speaker, because today this is an important 
debate. And, yes, my friends on the other side I respect and have great 
love and affection. But I remember in 1999, when we were on the floor 
as the majority party criticizing President Clinton for going into 
Bosnia, that was a nonbinding resolution.

That is what the Congress is about: debate, disagreements, agreement, 
debate. That is our constitutional responsibility.

Let me tell you what Karen Hughes, who was speaking for then-Governor 
Bush, who is now President Bush, said about the nonbinding resolution. 
This was in The Washington Post, March 27, 1999. I quote Mrs. Hughes 
speaking for Governor Bush at the time, criticizing President Clinton, 
and this is a quote. ''If we are going to commit American troops, we 
must be certain that they have a clear mission, an achievable goal, and 
an exit strategy.''

With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina, my colleague and friend (Mr. Coble).
