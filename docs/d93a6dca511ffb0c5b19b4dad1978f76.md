Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, news from the war in Iraq: The Iraq interim 
assessment report of progress states that sectarian murders in Baghdad 
are down from what they were in January. Many Iraqis are now coming 
forward with information to help root out terrorists from their hiding 
places.

On the local level, citizens are forming neighborhood watch groups 
and young Iraqis are joining the army and the police forces. Measured 
progress continues in Iraq. The surge strategy has only recently been 
completely implemented, and it seems that we are seeing positive signs.

A policy of surrender and failure in securing Iraq would hold 
catastrophic consequences for the United States and the Iraqi people. 
We should be focused on victory, not pandering to the ''peace at any 
price crowd.''

Those who want retreat, defeat and withdrawal while in the midst of 
this battle for Iraq have yet to understand that there are consequences 
for appeasement, and they are bad for the United States and the Iraqi 
people. Retreat will not bring victory and it will never bring peace.



And that's just the way it is.
