Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to honor a courageous 
south Floridian who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. 
U.N. Guard Louis Maxwell died fighting Taliban attackers at a hotel in 
Afghanistan last week. Louis and another U.N. security guard held off 
the terrorists and, in the process, saved innocent lives.

Louis graduated from Miami Central High School in the year 2000. He 
was such an outstanding trumpet player that he was offered a full music 
scholarship to Florida A&M University, yet he decided to serve his 
country and enlisted in the United States Navy. Louis later became a 
U.N. guard in the year 2007.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised Louis' bravery by saying 
the following: ''They fought through the corridors of the building and 
from the rooftop. They held off the attackers long enough for their 
colleagues to escape, armed only with pistols against assailants 
carrying automatic weapons and grenades and wearing suicide vests.''

I hope Louis' mother, Sandra, takes comfort in knowing that 17 people 
are alive today because of her son. I join her and the rest of his 
family in thanking Louis for his service, honoring his memory, and 
making sure that Louis will never be forgotten.
