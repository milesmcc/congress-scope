`Mr. PEARCE â€” 16 April 2008`

Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the patriotism 
and dedication of Bill and Peggy Zack. These two New Mexico residents 
have fully devoted their time and money to lifting the spirits of our 
troops deployed in Iraq.

Mr. and Mrs. Zack began the Pocket flag project in 2002 and have 
since sent out over 70,000 pocket flags. The pocket flags are small 
folded American flags that are enclosed with a message. On a small 
piece of paper reads ''A flag for your pocket so you can always carry a 
little piece of home. We are praying for you. Thank you for defending 
our freedom.'' A heartfelt message that is sure to lift the spirits of 
our service men and women. Pocket flags have been sent to the 647 
Support Group at Fort Bliss, Texas and all National Guard and special 
units being deployed through Ft. Bliss. Additional receipts of these 
flags include the Mountain Brigade in Fort Drum, NY and the AYN of the 
Alabama National Guard. The list goes on.

It should also be noted that Bill and Peggy don't accept any 
donations to help them with materials and shipping expenses. In fact 
the cost of shipping all 70,000 pocket flags has summed up to about 
$10,000 and over 7,000 hours. The only reimbursement the Zacks will 
accept are the letters written by soldiers currently deployed. While 
the letters vary, most say how thankful they are for Bill and Peggy 
taking the time to send them a little piece of home.

It is inspiring to know that citizens like Bill and Peggy Zack are 
trying to do all they can to lift the morale of our troops. On behalf 
of all servicemen and women I would like to thank Bill and Peggy Zack 
for all their efforts to comfort the troops in the Middle East.
