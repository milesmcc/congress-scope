Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Robert Causor, Jr., a paratrooper rifleman with the 82nd Airborne 
Division who was killed July 7 by a homemade bomb in Samarra, Iraq.

Robert was born and grew up in San Jose, California. Since childhood, 
he dreamed of being a soldier, and after graduating from Overfelt High 
School he enlisted to serve in Iraq. Despite worries from his family, 
Robert was determined to fulfill his lifelong dream.

To Robert, service in the military was a way to repay his country for 
the successes of his family. He came from a close family, one of 26 
cousins who lived in San Jose for over three decades.

On behalf of California's 16th Congressional District, I offer 
Robert's family our deepest condolences as they deal with this painful 
loss. He will be decorated with many honors, including a Bronze Star 
and a Purple Heart, but today our thoughts and our prayers are with his 
parents, the rest of his family and his friends.
