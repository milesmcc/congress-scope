Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, today this House is again going to 
consider legislation that would heed the


will of the American people by changing course in Iraq and paving the 
way for responsible redeployment of our troops.

Although the President claims that he is interested in cooperation 
with Congress, his most recent veto threat shows that to him 
cooperation still means, ''I'm the decider, you will do what I say.'' 
Well, the American people feel differently. The President is going to 
have to acknowledge that his course in Iraq is the wrong course, and 
that it is time to abandon this approach and work with Congress.

The bill we are considering today funds our troops, enhances our 
ability to go after al Qaeda and ensures benchmarks for the Iraqi 
Government that will ensure we are not on a road to nowhere in Iraq.

This bill sets the stage for responsible winding down of our military 
involvement in Iraq, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the 
President to sign it.
