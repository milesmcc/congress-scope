`Mr. KERRY â€” 25 May 2007`

---


Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution to 
insure that our troops get the pay raise they deserve. We are all proud 
of our men and women in the American military who continue to perform 
magnificently in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world. They represent 
the best that this country has to offer, and America owes them and 
their families a special debt of honor and gratitude. In light of their 
sacrifice, my resolution simply states that the Congress and the 
President should support a 3.5-percent increase in military pay in 2008 
and provide a special survivor indemnity allowance to help American 
military families.

Unfortunately, these provisions are opposed by the Bush 
administration.

On May 16, the Office of Management and Budget's Statement of 
Administration Policy for the House fiscal year 2008 Department of 
Defense Authorization bill opposes section 644 of the bill, which would 
pay military families a monthly special survivor indemnity allowance 
from the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund, calling the 
existing benefits ''sufficient.'' The Statement of Administration 
Policy also ''strongly opposes'' the provision of the House bill which 
provides a 0.5-percent increase in military pay above the President's 
proposed 3.0 percent across-the-board pay increase, calling it 
''unnecessary.''

I am concerned that the Bush administration's actions have failed to 
appropriately honor our military families who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice. These actions also stand in direct contrast to the will of 
the American people who support all efforts to support our troops.

Just go to the Military Times' own blog and read what the troops 
themselves say, more eloquently than any politician could put it: ''If 
there is someone in the administration that feels that we, the hard 
working American soldiers, don't need additional pay raises, then maybe 
they should get from behind their desk and pick up a gun and vest and 
go stand guard at the entry control points in Iraq. And while they are 
out there, lets take away their 6 figure income and give them $3.50 per 
day on top of anywhere from $15 to $45K per year. For all that we give 
to keep our country safe, the administration should at least want to 
help us eliminate any burden we may have financially. No I'm not saying 
make us rich and no one who enters the armed services expects to ever 
be rich but we don't expect to have to take out loans just to put food 
on the table for our families either.''

On this issue of fundamental fairness, the administration told 
Congress to back down. On this question, the troops will not back down 
and neither will we.

Those who have stood for us should know that we stand with them, 
today and always. Maintaining these provisions can do something to ease 
their burden, but truly supporting our troops requires that we act not 
just as individuals, but as a nation. I ask all my colleagues to 
support this resolution to honor our troops and our military families.
