Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of the bill 
before us, H.R. 2347, the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, introduced by 
the distinguished chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. 
Barney Frank of Massachusetts.

And I'm proud to cosponsor this bill, Mr. Speaker, because it's based 
on language that I drafted, and was adopted by the House last 
Congresses past as part of the Iran Freedom Support Act.

As all of us have heard from the great discussions this morning, 
Iran's rogue regime has sworn to destroy us, has sworn to destroy 
Israel, and has throughout decades. It's demonstrated the will and the 
capacity to do so. It has a long record of pursuing nuclear 
capabilities and of supporting the extreme elements of Islam, including 
Hamas, Hezbollah and those who kill and maim Americans in Iraq.

In fact, some have reported that Iran is providing the deep-buried 
IEDs that are indeed increasing the carnage in Iraq.

No amount of handholding, no amount of dialogue will be able to deter 
Tehran.

As part of an effort to prevent foreign funds from going to the 
Iranian regime, the bill before us authorizes State and local 
governments to direct divestiture and prevent investment in companies 
with investment of $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector.

And furthermore, the bill requires that a list of those companies 
that have invested $20 million or more be published biannually.

Furthermore, it protects investment companies and managers from being 
sued for divesting from companies included in the published list.

And although I fully support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I commend 
Chairman Frank for his efforts on this critical issue, as well as Mr. 
Sherman, who's been a leader on all the bills related to Iran, I'm 
concerned that this bill merely authorizes divestment from companies 
investing in Iran, rather than making divestment from those companies 
mandatory.



H.R. 1357, a bill I introduced earlier this year, along with Minority 
Whip Roy Blunt, would require divestment of all government pension 
plans or Thrift Savings Plans. Moreover, H.R. 1357 prohibits all future 
investments of government and private pension plans.

I strongly believe that we must increase the pressure aimed at 
isolating Iran's extremist regime, and the bill authored by Chairman 
Frank is an important step toward achieving this goal, and I commend 
him for it.

There are currently, also, Mr. Speaker, multiple measures dealing 
with putting further pressure on Iran including the Iran Counter-
Proliferation Act, authored by Congressman Tom Lantos, the chairman of 
our Foreign Affairs Committee; and we have got to work to have those 
bills passed and build upon them in order to derail the dangerous 
ambitions of Iran.

So I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is part of the 
effort of many of us to prevent U.S. dollars from enabling and 
facilitating the murderous efforts of radical extremists who intend to 
destroy us and our allies.

I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding me the time, and I 
thank the chairman, Mr. Frank of Massachusetts, for this bill.
