Mr. MILLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United States 
Congress, I rise today to honor the sacrifice of Staff Sergeant Darris 
Julius Dawson. On September 14, 2008, while serving his third tour in 
Iraq, Staff Sergeant Dawson was killed in the line of duty in Tunnis, 
Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Staff Sergeant Dawson joined the United States Army shortly after 
graduating from Escambia High School in Pensacola, Florida. Darris re-
enlisted twice and was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry 
Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort 
Stewart, Georgia.

Madam Speaker, the Northwest Florida community is proud of his 
service, and we offer our sincere condolences to his wife, four 
children, family and friends as they mourn their loss of this fine man. 
On behalf of the United States Congress and a grateful Nation, I am 
humbled to recognize his dedication and love for our country. May God 
continue to bless Darris and all of the men and women in uniform who 
protect our freedom, and may God continue to bless America.
