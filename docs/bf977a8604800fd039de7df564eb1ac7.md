# HONORING OUR HEROES ON MEMORIAL DAY
## `bf977a8604800fd039de7df564eb1ac7`
`Mr. PENCE â€” 23 May 2008`

---


Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay a debt to those we 
could never repay . . . the brave men and women of the United States 
Armed Forces, both past and present. It was their duty to serve, and 
with Memorial Day 2008 on the horizon, it is our duty to remember.

In a tradition that began just 3 years after the end of the Civil 
War, Americans set aside the 30th day of May each year to remember the 
sacrifice made by our service men and women who died while defending 
freedom.

On May 30, 1868, flowers were placed on the graves of Union and 
Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. That practice has 
continued for over 130 years as millions of Americans have laid flowers 
on the graves of soldiers from World War II, Vietnam and as recently as 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Madam Speaker, I would like to pay special remembrance today to the 
soldiers, marines and guardsmen from the Sixth Congressional District 
of Indiana who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.
