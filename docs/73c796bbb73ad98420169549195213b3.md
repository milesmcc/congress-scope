Mr. ROSS. You mentioned something that really piqued my interest, and 
that is making sure that we are providing our soldiers with the best 
technology in armored vests. And I want to thank you for raising that 
this evening.

I've got a constituent in my district whose son is getting ready to 
go back for the second time, Arkansas National Guard, 39th Brigade, 
being asked to go back for a second time. And when you sign up for the 
National Guard, you're supposed to spend 1 year out of 5, and now they 
were there in 2003 and 2004, they're being asked to go back again by 
Christmas of this year or early next year. And he raises a very 
important issue. This is a constituent from Garland County in Pearcy, 
Arkansas, near Hot Springs, and that is, he wants to ensure that our 
men and women in uniform, his son, has the best armored body gear and 
protection available. There are a lot of tests going on right now; 
there is a lot of debate going on. There have been hearings on this in 
the Congress. But 5 years into this war you would think, if our 
government, if this administration is sending $16 million an hour of 
your tax money to Iraq, the very least they could do is ensure that our 
brave men and women, our soldiers that do everything that is asked of 
them, have the very best in body gear and protection.
