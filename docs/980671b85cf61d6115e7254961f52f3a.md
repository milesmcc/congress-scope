`Mr. BRALEY of Iowa â€” 6 November 2007`

Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, due to a flight delay on my return 
trip from Iowa to Washington on November 5, 2007, I unavoidably missed 
rollcall votes Nos. 1034, 1035, and 1036.

Had I been present, on rollcall vote No. 1034, I would have voted 
''yea.''

As a co-sponsor of H.R. 513, the National Heroes Credit Protection 
Act, I would have voted ''yea'' on rollcall vote No. 1035. I am pleased 
that this important bill, which would protect the credit ratings of 
military servicemembers and alleviate financial stress for troops 
serving our country in Iraq and Afghanistan, passed the House 
unanimously.

On rollcall vote No. 1036, I would have voted ''yea.''
