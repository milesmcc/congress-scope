Mr. KAGEN. Well, the question then comes up, it is not just about 
values; it is about choices. So, if we are not going to be spending our 
hard-earned tax dollars for the good health of children, children who 
are in need, where are we going to spend that money? Where does the 
budget choose to spend it? Not here in our country, but in the sands of 
Iraq.



And I would suggest to you and everyone listening that we really 
cannot solve our health care problems, we really cannot solve many of 
the problems we are facing until we begin to bring an end to that 
involvement in that civil war in Iraq. I do not think any day should go 
by that we do not all stand up and ask the question where do you want 
to spend your hard-earned money, here at home or in the sands of Iraq?

You are quite correct; the budget the President has proposed is 
deficient, is neglectful to those who are most at risk, the children in 
poverty, and if you are not healthy, if you are not well fed, you 
cannot go to school and learn anything. If you do not get your 
education, you are not going to build a better future that we all 
require.
