Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, the United States of America and 
my hometown of Memphis lost one of its finest citizens, a brave soldier 
fighting in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Private First Class Brandon A. Owens was 21 years of age when he died 
of injuries sustained from small-arms fire. His unit, the 118th 
Military Police Company, 503rd Military Police Battalion, from Fort 
Bragg, North Carolina, was stationed in Wardak province when it was 
attacked by enemy forces.

Prior to joining the Army, Private First Class Owens attended 
Wooddale High School in Memphis, where he played on the basketball 
team. He was a very well-liked gentleman, small in stature but big in 
heart.

Private First Class Owens is survived by his parents Eric and Lynda 
Owens of Memphis.

Let us take a moment to remember the sacrifice he made for the 
stability of Afghanistan and the protection of its people.

Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time, and I thank the Owens family 
for their son. He paid the ultimate sacrifice, and I will join with his 
family in mourning this weekend.
