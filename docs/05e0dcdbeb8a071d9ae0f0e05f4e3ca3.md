Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor United States Army 
Sergeant Christian G. Rataczak, who passed away on July 9, 2010.

Born in Minneapolis, Christian moved to Phoenix with his family when 
he was five months old. After high school and college, he joined the 
National Guard and was deployed to Afghanistan for a year where he 
served as an Apache helicopter mechanic in Bravo Company, 1/285th 
Attack Reconnaissance Battalion. Wearing the uniform of the United 
States Army and serving his country was something he never took for 
granted. He was an outstanding soldier who will be remembered fondly by 
his Officers, NCOs and fellow Soldiers for his outstanding personality 
and attitude.

Christian worked for Dillon Aero of Scottsdale, and loved his job. 
His coworkers remember him as someone who was a joy to work with and 
was always willing to help no matter the circumstance.

We remember Christian and offer our deepest condolences and sincerest 
prayers to his family. My words cannot effectively convey the feeling 
of great loss nor can they offer adequate consolation. However, it is 
my hope that in future days, his family may take some comfort in 
knowing that Christian made a difference in the lives of many others 
and serves as an example of a competent and caring leader and friend 
that will live on in the hearts and minds of all those he touched.

Christian is survived by his mother Cheryll, his father Dave, his 
sister Jennifer, brother-in-law Todd, nephew Tanner, niece Hailey and 
many aunts, uncles, and cousins. His father, Dave, the former Adjutant 
General of the Arizona Guard, and his wife Cheryll are both close 
members of the Arizona military family and we mourn this tragic loss 
with them.

This body and this country owe Christian and his family our deepest 
gratitude, and we will today and forevermore honor and remember him and 
his service to our country.
