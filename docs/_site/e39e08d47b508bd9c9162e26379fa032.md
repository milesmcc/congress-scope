Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, yesterday's hearing in the Government Reform 
Committee left me with many concerns. I am concerned about Blackwater's 
role when they get involved in U.S. military operations.

In April and November of 2004, Blackwater personnel attached 
themselves to U.S. troops and engaged enemy positions. These actions 
may have set a bad precedent and may have been a catalyst that led to 
the September 16 shooting death of Iraqi civilians.

I also am concerned about Blackwater's unprecedented rise in 
procurement of Federal Government contracts. Initially, Blackwater was 
awarded no-bid contracts for security services in August of 2003 and 
June of 2004 worth more than $73 million, and the President just today 
vetoed a bill for children's health that was worth $11 billion.
