# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Ms. FALLIN. Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by reviewing a 
little history. There have been a number of times in American history 
when wars didn't go as we had hoped or planned. That winter at Valley 
Forge was certainly difficult. During the War of 1812, the British 
occupied this very building, and the Civil War was far more costly and 
far longer than we hoped it would be.

In World War II, the North African campaign was something of a mess. 
And the bloody island campaigns of the South Pacific were not something 
we had foreseen.

In Korea and Vietnam, we brought limited force to bear, and we wound 
up settling for stalemate and ultimately defeat.

So some of our wars went well, but more often they look a lot simpler 
and cleaner in the history books than they really were in reality. And 
if there is one constant warning that runs throughout our history, it 
is this: Congress has a vital role to play in helping America win its 
wars. But it can also play a role that is unintended in losing them if 
it says or if it does the wrong thing at the wrong time. And that is 
what this resolution says and does, the wrong thing.

This is a nonbinding resolution, which is nothing more than a 
political game. But the war on terror is not a game. We have to 
consider what our enemies will read into this resolution. What if 
Congress during the Valley Forge winter had passed a resolution saying 
it is time to send our troops home, retire General Washington, and go 
ahead and pay the tax anyway? What if Congress in the spring of 1863 
had looked at the results of Bull Run and said, We can't win this, it's 
a civil war. Forget the idealism about freeing the slaves.

What if Congress in 1942 or 1943 had told Franklin Roosevelt to pull 
out of North Africa and Italy and to give up those silly ideas of 
liberating France? What would our enemies have thought about America's 
lack of will? They would have assumed that we had lost our will to win, 
and they would have said America can't cut it.



Well, make no mistake, Iraq is just one battle in our overall war on 
terror. If this resolution passes, it is sending a very clear message 
of our weakness, and our enemies are watching today. Just listen to the 
words of Osama bin Laden. He said, The whole world is watching this war 
and the two adversaries, the Islamic Nation on the one hand, and the 
United States and its allies on the other. It is either victory or 
glory, or it is either misery or humiliation.

We cannot be the Nation of humiliation. The terrorists know what is 
at stake, and it is time that we show them that we know as well, and 
that failure is not an option for our Nation. We have to ask ourselves, 
what is at risk for the future of our Nation? Will our Nation be safer 
from radical Islamic terrorists if we pull out before the new Iraqi 
democracy becomes stable and an ally in the war on terror? Ask 
yourself, what Islamic terrorist leader has said that if America leaves 
Iraq that he will be satisfied and the terrorists will end their 
attack? Has not been said.

We must take extraordinary precautions to protect our Nation from 
those who would do us harm, and someday our children and our 
grandchildren will look back on this decision this week, and they will 
reflect on their lives, and the question we have to ask ourselves today 
is will our children live in a safer America?

I urge the rejection of this resolution.
