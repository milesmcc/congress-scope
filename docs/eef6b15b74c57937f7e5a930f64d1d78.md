Mr. DINGELL. Madam Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with my 
dear friend, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, regarding 
language contained in the House report, Veterans Affairs and Related 
Appropriations Bill for 2010.

I'm concerned the language could have the effect of postponing 
activation of a much-needed clinic for our veterans in Toledo. Clearly, 
it is not in the best interest of our veterans to postpone activation 
of a new clinic that will better address a higher workload, especially 
in light of the increasing numbers of veterans returning from the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I yield to my good friend.
