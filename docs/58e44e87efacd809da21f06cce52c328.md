`Mr. SESSIONS â€” 6 November 2007`

Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, the poem below was written by poet and 
Capitol guide Albert Carey Caswell in honor of Gunnery Sergeant Angel 
Barcenas from Paramount, California. Gunnery Sgt. Barcenas admirably 
served our great nation on Marine One during the Clinton and Bush 
Administrations. In July 2006, he was wounded by an improvised 
explosive device in Iraq and had both of his legs amputated below the 
knee. He started walking again 3 months after his attack, crediting the 
professionals at Walter Reed for his quick recovery. In May 2007, 
fighting all odds, he led a two-mile motivational run through lower 
Manhattan with the Marine Corps, and New York firefighters and police. 
Gunnery Sgt. Barcenas is an American hero whose unwavering sense of 
duty and dedication should be an example for all Americans. I proudly 
submit the following into the Record.
















 Marine One
