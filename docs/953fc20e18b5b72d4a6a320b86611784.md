Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, what are the most important issues facing 
today's high school and college students? Being able to afford college? 
Access to health care? The Iraq war? Who are their favorite Democratic 
candidates? Obama? Clinton? Edwards?


Who are their favorite Republican candidates? Giuliani? McCain? Romney?

Well, thanks to the first ever National Youth Presidential Forum on 
November 14, 2007, up to 10 million young people will have the 
opportunity to hear from the Presidential candidates from both parties 
and then cast their votes.

As the Congressman from central Florida, I'm very proud that the Lou 
Frey Institute of Politics and Government at the University of Central 
Florida is playing a key role in putting together this unprecedented 
event.

They've joined together with the EWN Foundation, The Presidential 
Classroom, and the United States Association of Former Members of 
Congress to sponsor a 3-hour forum online, which brings together 
Presidential candidates and America's young people for the first time 
in a unique Webcast.

This is how it will work. Presidential classroom scholars will create 
questions which will then be sent to the Presidential candidates who 
can respond via videotape prior to the event or live the day of the 
event. Then, thanks to the event sponsors, the Webcast will be provided 
free to each of the participating high schools and colleges across the 
United States.

All of the students will then be able to vote for up to 36 hours 
after hearing from each of the candidates on the issues most important 
to them.

I urge my colleagues to go to www.rocktheweb.org for more information 
on this great project. It provides a valuable civics lesson for our 
students and important feedback to our Presidential candidates on the 
key issues facing America's young people.

I would encourage all of the Presidential candidates, high schools 
and colleges to participate in this worthwhile educational opportunity.
