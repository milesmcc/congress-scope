Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see so many people on the 
other side of the aisle have discovered the report of the Iraq Study 
Group.

It is now my pleasure to yield 5/1/2/ minutes to a senior member of 
the Ways and Means and Agriculture Committees, the gentleman from North 
Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy).
