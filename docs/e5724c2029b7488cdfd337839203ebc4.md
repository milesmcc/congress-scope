Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, work in 
your sphere of influence and this Senator will try to do the same. What 
we have is an approaching train wreck, because if the Congress passes 
this emergency funding bill for the war that has this language in it, 
if that passes this week, then the President is going to veto it next 
week and that is going to leave us right back where we are, with both 
sides making a lot of noise and a lot of rhetoric, but that doesn't get 
us any closer to where we are going. So I say to my colleague, look 
over the horizon beyond this week and see where we can come together.

I thought the most promising prospect was when Jim Baker and Lee 
Hamilton came down with the Iraq Study Commission report. They showed, 
in a bipartisan way among very prominent people of both parties, how 
you should approach this Iraq situation, and yet, that was last 
November or December when it came out, and here we are 4 months later 
and still we have not come together in common ground. So I would 
encourage my colleague to keep working.
