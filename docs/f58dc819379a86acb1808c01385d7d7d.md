`Mr. GORDON of Tennessee â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. I thank my friend for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, as I have watched this healthy debate over the last 2 
days, I keep thinking about an e-mail that I received from a lady in 
Springfield, Tennessee. You would never accuse this woman of not 
supporting the troops because her husband was a soldier serving in 
Iraq. He was a month from returning home to his wife and his two 
daughters, but he was ordered to stay in Iraq for another 6 months 
because our troops are spread so thin. He hasn't been home since 
October of 2005. These are the words that she wrote to me: ''Mr. 
Gordon, we need to help other countries, but there are already 3,000 
families in America whose lives will never be the same. I want, need, 
and would love to see my husband again.''

Mr. Speaker, this lady supports the troops. I support the troops in 
Iraq, and I believe everyone in this Chamber supports our troops. They 
perform their missions with bravery and honor, and I commend them for 
the job they are doing. But I am unconvinced that deploying more troops 
and spending more money is the right strategy. And I am not the only 
one. General Colin Powell said in December: ''I am not persuaded that 
another surge of troops into Baghdad for purposes of suppressing this 
civil war will work.''



General George Casey, the former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, 
said last month: ''It's always been my view that a heavy and sustained 
American military presence was not going to solve the problem in Iraq . 
. . ''

In December it was reported that the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
unanimously disagreed with the concept of troop escalation.

General Colin Powell, General George Casey, and the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, these are men who support the troops. Yet these American 
generals, the Iraqi Study Group, and the Iraqi Prime Minister have all 
opposed this troop surge.

We have had four other surges since we first went to Iraq. None 
produced a lasting change on the ground. In October more combat troops 
were sent into Baghdad to fight the growing violence there. 
Unfortunately, the sectarian violence has only grown worse. Many have 
endured great sacrifices in the 4 years this war has been waged. More 
than 3,000 Americans have lost their lives; 23,000 more have been 
wounded. We have spent more than $350 billion with many billions more 
to go. We have been in Iraq longer than we were involved in World War 
II. And there is no end in sight.

For 1,300 years Sunnis have been fighting Shias. Now is the time for 
the Iraqis to take more responsibility for securing the peace in their 
own nation. No one has offered any evidence that 20,000 more American 
troops would change the direction of a 4-year-old war or 1,300 years of 
history.
