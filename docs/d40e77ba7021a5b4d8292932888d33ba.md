`Mr. CONAWAY â€” 19 March 2007`

Mr. CONAWAY. If you look at our history, if you look at the year 1776 
and you study George Washington that year, he got up every day thinking 
that was the last day of the revolution. His army in many cases was in 
tatters, it was unpaid, it was underequipped. He could not have made 
the certification that the Democrats are demanding that this President 
make in order to send a single unit into combat; Washington could not 
have made that certification and he would have had to give up.

He got up every day thinking, This is the last day of the deal. I am 
sure there were critics all over the place saying we are done, it is 
over, this grand experiment that turned into America, turned into 230 
years of a beacon for liberty and democracy around the world, would 
have failed had he not stuck to this plan and stuck to the 
understanding that we could win this fight. And it was hard. Good men 
lost their lives every day, and it was hard.

We are there at the same place today in Iraq. It is hard and good men 
and women risk their lives and some lose their lives every single day. 
I mourn with the families and I cry with them, just as you do, when 
somebody from the district is killed or maimed or injured. This has 
serious consequences to what we do. But failure in Iraq, a disaster 
that would be an immediate pullout, is simply unacceptable on every 
level.


Let me switch gears for a minute, and then I will let my good 
colleague close, with some good news, totally unrelated to the 
supplemental except that it does have to do with this year's financial 
results.

As you know, I am a CPA and I like to look at numbers and all those 
kinds of things. If you look at the first 5 months of fiscal 2007, our 
revenue collections into this Federal Government are up $81 billion 
over the equivalent 5-month period in fiscal 2006. An additional $81 
billion has been collected, not because we raised taxes, not because we 
had any changes to the Tax Code, because we haven't implemented any of 
those, but it is because this economy is ginning along. Expenses are 
also up almost $26 billion. So the net of those two is that we have got 
a deficit for the first 5 months of fiscal 2007 that is $55.5 billion 
less than the equivalent 5-month deficit for fiscal 2006.

I just wanted to inject a little great news into the conversation and 
get that into the record. These numbers come directly from the Treasury 
Department's monthly financial reports that are available on the Web 
for anybody to look at. I wanted to highlight those numbers tonight as 
we finish up this Countdown hour that we spent tonight talking about 
Iraq.

These are grave times, tough times, hard times, and I think our 
resolve is firm. We will see this week the integrity of our colleagues 
in this Chamber as to how they vote, how they have talked in this 
Chamber versus how they vote on this deal.

There are only two positions: stay and fight, win this thing and be 
successful; or get out, get our folks out now. There is no half step in 
between that you can orchestrate any kind of a justification that makes 
any sense. It will be interesting to watch our colleagues as they 
struggle with this vote this week, with their own integrity and their 
own ideas of what is right and wrong.

With that, to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, I will yield back. 
Thank you for having this Special Order tonight.
