Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Inglis) who has traveled to Iraq several times, I 
yield myself a minute to answer some questions posed on the other side 
of the aisle.

What we have here is a nonspecific, nondetailed, nothing planned for 
victory. The bill on page 3, since the gentleman refers to the bill, 
let's look at it. It talks about a reduction, a transition, a limited 
presence, a limited presence, again, with maximum attention paid to the 
protection of our Armed Forces. What does that mean? So you want our 
troops to face the terrorists with even less protection?

It shall be further implemented as part of a comprehensive strategy. 
What do these phrases mean? What would General Petraeus do if this 
legislation were to become law, which it will not? This is not a plan. 
It says nothing. It is making a political statement.

I am pleased to yield 3/1/2/ minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. Inglis) who has been to Iraq and understands the 
situation well.
