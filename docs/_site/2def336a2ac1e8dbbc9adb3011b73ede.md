Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our distinguished colleague from 
Maine.

It has been a hard work in progress, but we reiterate, perhaps 
Members want to offer their own resolutions. We are open to 
suggestions. We are not trying to grab votes, just make ours stronger.

I bring to the attention of my colleague, this is not to be construed 
as saying, Mr. President, you cannot do anything; we suggest you look 
at openings by which we could, hopefully, have substantially less 
United States involvement of troops in what we foresee as a bitter 
struggle of sectarian violence.

The American GI, in my judgment, has sacrificed greatly, and their 
families, in giving sovereignty to this Nation. Now we see it is in the 
grip of extraordinary sectarian violence. Sunni upon Shia, Shia upon 
Sunni. I am not trying to ascribe which is more guilty than the other, 
but why should they proceed to try and destabilize the very government 
that gives all Iraqis a tremendous measure of freedom, free from 
tyranny and from Saddam Hussein. Why should the American GI, who does 
not have a language proficiency, who does not have a full understanding 
of the culture giving rise to these enormous animosities and hatreds 
that precipitate the killings and other actions--why should not that be 
left to the Iraqi forces?

We have trained upwards of 200,000. We have reason to believe today 
there are 60,000 to 70,000 who are tested--in many respects they have 
been participating in a number of military operations, together with 
our forces. Let elements of that group be the principals to take the 
lead, as they proudly say, give them the lead, and go into the 
sectarian violence. That would enable our commanders, our President, to 
send fewer than 20,500 into that area.

On the other hand, we support the President with respect to his 
options regarding the Anbar Province and the additional forces.

Am I not correct in that?
