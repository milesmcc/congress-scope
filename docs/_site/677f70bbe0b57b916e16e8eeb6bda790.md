Mr. MURTHA. Let me just conclude by thanking Bill Young on all of the 
work he did and all of the rest of the subcommittee on the work they 
did.

And let me reiterate this is all about the troops being taken care 
of, making sure they have what they need. We put the full amount that 
the President requested for the people in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we 
made sure that we gave them a pay raise. And when I see those troops--
whether it's in the field, at the bases, whether I see them overseas or 
I see the troops in the hospitals--I have such great admiration for 
what they do. And we're just trying to make sure they have everything 
that they need.

The F-22, as the gentleman from Florida says, we're going to argue 
that later. We would have to have 292 votes in the House; we'd have to 
have 66 votes in the Senate, so you can see the position I'm in and the 
problems that we would have if we were to go forward. I just want to 
make sure that the planes we have are robustly funded.
