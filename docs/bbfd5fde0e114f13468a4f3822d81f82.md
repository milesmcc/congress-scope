Mr. CLEAVER. Thank you. The problem with that, and I appreciate your 
interest in this issue, and I am sure you probably are not aware of the 
fact that in New Orleans there are 36,000 participants in TANF. All but 
5,000 are children; all but 5,000 are children. This legislation is 
saying we want children to volunteer 20 hours a week in order to 
receive assistance.

In addition to that, we are spending about $5 billion a week in Iraq, 
and we are building housing, but we are not requiring Iraqis to 
volunteer in order to be the recipients of the largesse of the American 
taxpayers.

The assumption here is that the people don't need to work and so they 
somehow have to be coerced into working. As a former resident of public 
housing, there is a new issue arising, and that is that many of the 
people in public housing are elderly.
