`Mr. BENNET â€” 17 November 2010`

---


Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today 
to honor the life and heroic service of SSG Carlos A. Benitez. Staff 
Sergeant Benitez, who was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th 
Infantry Division, in Fort Carson, CO, died on October 14, 2010, from 
injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near 
his vehicle. Staff Sergeant Benitez was serving in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. He was 24 years old.

A native of Carrollton, TX, Staff Sergeant Benitez graduated from 
Creekview High School and joined the Army in October 2004. He served 
three tours of duty: two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan--all with 
decoration. His wife and young daughter and son moved to Colorado for 
Staff Sergeant Benitez's most recent assignment.

During 5 years of service, Staff Sergeant Benitez distinguished 
himself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to 
take on any job. He was awarded numerous awards and medals, including 
two Army Commendation Medals, the Valorous Unit Award, the Army Good 
Conduct Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, and 
the Iraq Campaign Medal with four Campaign Stars.

Staff Sergeant Benitez worked on the front lines of battle, serving 
in the most dangerous areas of Iraq and Afghanistan. He is remembered 
by those who knew him as a consummate professional with an unending 
commitment to excellence. Friends and loved ones remember his 
commitment to his wife. His mother, Imelda, remembers how her son 
wanted to enlist in the Army when he was just 17. She made him wait an 
extra year.

Mark Twain once said, ''The fear of death follows from the fear of 
life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Staff 
Sergeant Benitez's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by 
selflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He 
lived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.

At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones 
throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield 
was uncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her 
safety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he 
touched, Staff Sergeant Benitez will forever be remembered as one of 
our country's bravest.

To Staff Sergeant Benitez's wife, their children, and his entire 
family--I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope that, 
in time, the pain of your loss will be eased by your pride in Carlos's 
service and by your knowledge that his country will never forget him. 
We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.
