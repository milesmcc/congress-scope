`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 18 May 2010`

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the sacrifice of a 
brave young Iowan, LCpl Joshua M. Davis, who died from wounds he 
received while supporting combat operations in Helmand Province, 
Afghanistan. He was 19 years old. Josh's loss will be felt very deeply 
in his hometown of Perry, IA, where his drive and leadership skills 
were recognized early on as a member of the football and wrestling 
teams and SkillsUSA. He was determined to serve his country and joined 
the Marine Corps right after high school, even graduating a trimester 
early to start basic training. Accounts describe Lance Corporal Davis 
as humble, but his sense of patriotism and service humbles me and makes 
me proud to be an Iowan. Learning about the life of this remarkable 
young man makes the knowledge of his tremendous sacrifice all the more 
poignant. My thoughts and prayers will be with his family at this time, 
including his father Dave, his mother Beverly, and all those touched by 
his loss. I cannot adequately express the debt of gratitude we owe, but 
I ask all Senators to reflect on, and pay tribute to, the life of a 
great American, LCpl Joshua Davis.
