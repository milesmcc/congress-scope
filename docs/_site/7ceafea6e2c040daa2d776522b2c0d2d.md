Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
for your leadership.

In 2003, Congress approved a $78 billion supplemental. In 2004, it 
was $87 billion. In 2005, it was $82 billion. In 2006, it was $72 
billion, and now the administration wants almost $100 billion more.

Over 3,400 of our brave troops and countless Iraqis have died in this 
occupation. The President has dug us deep in a hole in Iraq, and it 
boggles my mind, boggles my mind that Congress wants to give him 
another blank check to buy more shovels.

This occupation and civil war cannot be won militarily. Mr. Speaker, 
how many will have to die before this House stops writing blank checks?

The American people are looking to Congress to end this failed policy 
and to bring our troops home.

Two months ago, we went to the Rules Committee to try to get an 
amendment to fully fund the safe and timely withdrawal of the United 
States forces from Iraq. That is what we should be voting on today, not 
to give the President another blank check. So I urge my colleagues to 
vote against this bill.
