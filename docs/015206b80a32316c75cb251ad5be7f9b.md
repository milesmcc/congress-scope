Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I thank him for offering this amendment.



Madam Chair, we would strongly support this amendment. As he is well 
aware of--and as, I think, most of the Nation is--the young men and 
women who have joined the Armed Forces over the last 8 or 9 years left 
this country to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the 
trouble spots of the world. Many of them left as high school graduates, 
some of them not high school graduates. They even left an economy that 
is very different today than it was when they left their homes to serve 
this Nation. Clearly, we want to make sure that they have the 
opportunities to integrate back into the economy after leaving the 
service on terms that are helpful to them, to their families and to 
their local communities.

So thank you very much for offering this amendment.
