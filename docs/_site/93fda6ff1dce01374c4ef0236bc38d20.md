Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my friend for yielding.

A tired old tradition is being carried out on the House floor today. 
When it comes time to extend the national debt ceiling, the Members in 
the minority get up and express outrage, and enough Members in the 
majority get up and show responsibility and vote to do what needs to be 
done to pay the Nation's bills.

Madam Speaker, I know a lot of people watching this are scratching 
their heads and saying, how did we get to such a terrible predicament? 
Whose fault is it? And I think they're tired of hearing whose fault it 
is because, frankly, when the other side is in the majority, we say 
it's their fault; when they're in the minority, they say it's our 
fault.

I think a history lesson is in order. In 2001, as Mr. Tanner said, we 
were looking at a projected $5 trillion surplus over the decade that 
we're now closing out. We're going to take in $5 trillion more than we 
spent. There were three things that happened in that decade that 
injured that prospect. The first was horrific, unavoidable, and the 
fault of no one in this room; it was the terrorist attack on the 
country on September 11, 2001, which had and still has negative 
economic consequences as well as security consequences for the country.

The second thing that happened, in my view, is that two disastrous 
choices were made. The first was to launch two wars by borrowing the 
money to pay for those wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan. We certainly 
can disagree--and we have around here a lot--as to whether or not those 
wars were or were not in the national interest, but I think we should 
have understood that it was absolutely not in the national interest to 
defy historic tradition and finance those wars by borrowing money, 
unlike more responsible predecessors of ours had done in other times.

The second disastrous decision was a tax cut, a huge majority of 
which benefited the wealthiest 5 or 10 percent of people in this 
country. That created a mountain of debt that shifted us from a 
projected $5 trillion surplus to a projected deficit instead.

Then followed the financial meltdown of the fall of 2008. The 
Treasury Secretary told us in no uncertain terms that he felt that we 
were perhaps a few days away from the collapse of the global economy. 
So to this floor came a $700 billion bailout bill for the banking 
industry, and a lot of Members on both sides voted for it. I think it 
was the right vote because I do think it staved off that calamity from 
happening, and that added to the national debt. And yes, there were 
decisions made since the new administration came in to do the stimulus 
bill in a way that was not paid for.
