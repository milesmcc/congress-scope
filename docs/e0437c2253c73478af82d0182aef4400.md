`Mr. SHERMAN â€” 19 June 2008`

---


Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I voted for a provision that would provide 
funds for Iraq and Afghanistan when, under the rules governing the 
legislation, that funding would be tied with a specific mandate for an 
orderly redeployment of troops from Iraq.

Today, June 19th, I voted against providing funds for the conduct of 
the war in Iraq and Afghanistan when such funding was not linked to 
such a mandate.
