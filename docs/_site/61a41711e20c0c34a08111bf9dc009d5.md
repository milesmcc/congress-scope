`Mr. LAMBORN â€” 4 October 2007`

---


Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the liberals' 
fraudulent attacks on Rush Limbaugh. Anyone who reads the widely 
available transcript as I have done sees that Mr. Limbaugh was 
appropriately referring to the pretenders who pose as medal winners or 
who falsely claim to have committed atrocities in Iraq when he used the 
phrase ''phony soldiers.''

No, the real scandal here is that liberals in America and here in 
this Congress are willing to manipulate facts to smear those they 
disagree with. But there's an even more insidious agenda by liberals 
going on and that is to reinstitute the so-called Fairness Doctrine, 
which is actually a way to silence conservatives on the radio waves. 
Mr. Limbaugh deserves mega-kudos for being a forceful and effective 
voice on the side of common sense and for being an example of the first 
amendment in action. After all, isn't that what our country is supposed 
to be about?
