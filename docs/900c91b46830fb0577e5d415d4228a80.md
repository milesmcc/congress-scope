`Mr. SALAZAR â€” 22 May 2007`

Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the gentleman from Arkansas and his 
work with my Blue Dog colleagues in demanding more fiscal 
responsibility in Iraq. I believe that Congress has now approved nearly 
$510 billion for military operations since 2001, with nearly no 
oversight on spending. Operation Iraqi Freedom alone has cost American 
taxpayers $51 billion in 2003, $77.3 billion in 2004, $87.3 billion in 
2005, $104 billion in 2006, and in 2007 we are in the process of 
funding Operation Iraqi Freedom once again with a supplemental. Now we 
are spending over $10 billion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan just on 
government contractors working on reconstruction. All of this is 
unchecked, and that is why I am so proud to join my Blue Dog colleagues 
as a supporter of H. Res. 97.

H. Res. 97 was introduced by the Blue Dog Coalition to call for 
transparency on how Iraq funds are spent. We have a plan for 
accountability in Iraq. Our plan calls for, first, transparency on how 
war funds are spent. Second of all, it creates a commission to 
investigate awarded contracts. Third of all, it stops the use of 
emergency supplementals to fund the war.

Everything that I have read over the past several years indicates 
that this is the first administration that has used supplementals to 
fund a war after the first year, after initiation. In January we passed 
what was called the PAYGO rule. It is my understanding that with 
supplementals, you don't have to follow PAYGO rules. I think it is 
critical that we as Blue Dogs continue to move forward and push for an 
honest budget.

Number four, it uses American resources to improve Iraq's ability to 
police itself. I believe that this is of critical importance.



Mr. Speaker, you cannot push democracy on someone who does not want 
it. Over 65 percent of the Iraqi population now says it is okay to 
shoot at American soldiers. The Iraqi Parliament a couple of weeks ago 
voted 144 out of 275 members to tell Americans that it is time for us 
to come home. We cannot force democracy on someone who does not want 
it.

I believe, Mr. Speaker, that today what is important is that we turn 
this over to the Iraqi Government. Our soldiers can become the 
advisors. They should not be on the front lines.

The gentleman talks about the Social Security Trust Fund. Two years 
ago I introduced the Social Security Protection Act, which would not 
allow any politician in Washington to touch that trust fund. I think 
the gentleman raises a critical point there.

He also talks about the veterans. I am the only veteran in the 
Colorado delegation. I am proud to be a Blue Dog, and I am proud that 
this legislation addresses the lack of oversight and accountability in 
Iraq. But I am also very proud that this resolution stands for 
veterans' issues.

Government reports have documented waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq. 
Contractors are being paid billions of dollars by the United States for 
their services in Iraq. Most of these, Mr. Speaker, are no-bid 
contracts. Where is the accountability in that? I believe that if their 
work is resulting in unsanitary conditions, potential health hazards, 
poor construction methods or significant cost overruns, then Congress 
has the right to know about it. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that it is time 
to stop this waste.

Congressional oversight is desperately needed. This administration 
should be held accountable for how reconstruction funds are being used. 
This Blue Dog bill is a commonsense proposal that ensures transparency 
and accountability. We bring oversight back to Congress. We start 
showing improvement in Iraq, and accountability leads directly to 
success. Iraqis must begin progress towards full responsibility for 
policing their own country. Without progress, it is a waste to continue 
U.S. investment in troops and financial services.

Mr. Speaker, I visited Iraq twice. While I have seen some 
improvements in some areas, I have also seen the increase in insurgent 
attacks not only on American troops, but on other Iraqis.

We all support our troops, and we will do everything within our power 
to make sure that they have the equipment and the funding that they 
need. However, Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to write blank checks to 
the administration. I firmly believe that until our last troop is 
returned home, the American people deserve to know how their money is 
being spent.

Accountability is not only patriotic, it often determines success 
from failure. The Blue Dog bill gives an opportunity to regain 
oversight responsibility. This is the responsibility that we have to 
all of our men and women in uniform, to their parents and to the 
American taxpayer who is footing the bill.

The gentleman brings up another valid point. He talks about how the 
budget is a moral document. I, frankly, sir, could not run my household 
and put my farm into debt and pass the debt on to my children. That 
is exactly what has happened over the last 5 years. We had a surplus in 
the budget. The economy was doing great.


Democrats have a plan that by 2011 we will balance this budget. It is 
with the help of the Blue Dog Coalition, with the help of gentlemen 
like the gentleman from Arkansas, who is so committed to make sure 
there is accountability, that we will figure out a way to truly be 
honest with the American people in our budgets.

We want to put the Iraqi war supplemental back into the regular 
budget process so that we have a true, accurate picture of what our 
national debt is, what our deficit is. The gentleman was showing that 
we have $8.8 trillion in debt right now. Well, I can assure the 
gentleman from Arkansas when I came into Congress in the last Congress, 
our national debt was $78.045 trillion. Your share of that debt, your 
children's share of that debt, was back then $26,000. I believe the 
figure you show now, Mr. Ross, is some $29,000, I believe $29,174 and 
some cents.

I believe, Mr. Ross, that this is morally wrong, and I believe that 
it is time for Congress to start being honest and report to the 
American people what troubles the last 5 years Congress has moved the 
American people toward. I have heard that by the year 2040, every 
single penny that comes in in Federal revenues will go to pay just the 
interest on the national debt. That is without running government. I 
believe that is morally wrong.

With that, Mr. Speaker, I would ask this Congress, I would ask this 
Democratic Congress and the Blue Dog Coalition, to continue fighting 
for balanced budgets, to continue fighting for accountability, because 
that is what the American people want.
