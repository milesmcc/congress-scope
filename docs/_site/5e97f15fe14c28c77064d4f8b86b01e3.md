Mr. FARR. I hear from the other side that government takes over 
health care. I'm just wondering which one of you Members is going to 
give up your Navy doctors downstairs to take care of you. Which one of 
you is going to give up your Federal health care plan which insures all 
the members of your family? Which one of you is going to give up 
Medicare for all of your constituents? Which one of you is going to 
give up the veterans' care in the veterans' clinics that are in your 
districts? Which one of you who loves the military that is doing such a 
great job of defending our country in Iraq and in Afghanistan is going 
to take away the military TRICARE program?

Yes, government is involved in health care. It sure is. That's what 
our country is surviving and living on. Let's make this work and stop 
attacking each other.
