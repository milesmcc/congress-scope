Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, a strong sense of patriotism is sweeping 
through the second district of Texas between to local football teams 
and spreading on to the gridiron. It is a short story, but it says 
volumes about the generosity and spirit of the people of Texas.

The varsity cheerleaders at Klein Forest High School and Westfield 
High School challenged each other to see who could raise the most money 
for troops returning home from Iraq.

The challenge would last two weeks and the money would be presented 
to members of the Family Readiness Group of Company B, 15th Brigade 
Troops Battalion, 15th Sustainment Brigade during a homecoming football 
game.

The cheerleaders collected donations during and after school for the 
next two weeks. They asked local businesses to help support the troops 
returning home to Texas. During the homecoming football game, they 
passed around buckets throughout the stadium for additional donations 
from the fans.

The two cheerleading squads raised close to $4,000.00 for the Family 
Readiness Group to use in welcoming home the troops this holiday 
season.

I commend both squads for being generous and patriotic Americans. 
Thanks for showing the troops that we support and appreciate the 
sacrifices they are making for us, our families, and our future.

And that's just the way it is.
