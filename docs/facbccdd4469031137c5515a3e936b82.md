Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

This companion bill to S. 3844 ensures that the proposed nuclear 
cooperation agreement with Australia is approved before the existing 
agreement expires at the end of this calendar year.

Since the Australia 123 agreement was submitted on May 5, changes to 
the announced House schedule created the possibility that Congress 
might possibly adjourn before the agreement met the Atomic Energy Act's 
requirement of a review period of 90 days of continuous session.

The direct result would have been a disruption of several months of 
our nuclear trade and cooperation with Australia, which supplies the 
United States 25 percent of its uranium. But now it appears that the 
projected extension of the lame duck session will be sufficient to meet 
the 90-day requirement.

However, there are still several reasons the House should still vote 
to pass this bill. The most important is the opportunity to express our 
strong support and admiration for our close ally, Australia. For seven 
decades the United States and Australia have developed ever closer 
ties, which have been repeatedly tested in both war and peace.

Beginning in World War II and extending through Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, 
and now Afghanistan, the United States and Australian troops have 
fought side by side. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Australia has been a loyal 
ally in every major war since World War II that the United States has 
fought in.

Without its bedrock support, the defense of our interests in the East 
and South Asia would be greatly undermined. Reliable allies are rare in 
this world, and close friends are even rarer.

This bill also is a recognition of Australia's exemplary record in 
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide. It has taken 
responsibility very seriously and cooperated closely with the United 
States on nonproliferation issues across the board, most recently by 
joining with us to impose new and tougher sanctions on Iran.

There is another and equally important reason the House should vote 
for this bill: Namely, to demonstrate the contrast between this nuclear 
cooperation agreement with Australia and that proposed for Russia, 
which is also before Congress and which also faces an expiration of the 
90-day deadline.

While Australia has been a reliable ally and a partner and honest 
with the United States, Russia has worked to undermine our interests 
around the world, from Iran to Europe and Venezuela to Syria. Moscow's 
overt and covert assistance to Iran's nuclear program has been crucial 
to Tehran's progress in developing a nuclear weapons capabilities.

It has built the Bushehr nuclear facility, which is scheduled to come 
online in January, and the Russians have said they are ready to 
construct several more. Russia has repeatedly acted to protect Iran 
from international pressure aimed at halting its nuclear weapons 
program.

Its repeated threats to veto any significant U.N. Security Council 
effort to impose sanctions on Iran have ensured that only weak measures 
have been adopted, which Tehran has laughed at and ignored. Russia has 
also signed nuclear cooperation agreements with the rogue regimes in 
Burma and Venezuela and continues to market its nuclear wares anywhere 
in the world to anyone that has a little money to spend.

Given this record, an intelligent observer might wonder why we are 
even considering nuclear cooperation with a country so determined to 
undermine our interests, that consistently does not tell the truth. 
Well, the answer is that this nuclear cooperation agreement was offered 
to Russia first by the previous and then by the current administration 
as one of a series of gifts in an effort to bribe Moscow into 
cooperating on Iran.

The strategy obviously has not worked, and the agreement certainly 
cannot be sold on its merits. Moscow sees this as a way to make money, 
but it is difficult to identify how the United States might benefit 
from the agreement.

By voting for this bill, the House will reaffirm its strong support 
for the United States' alliance with our friends and allies, the 
Australians.

It will thereby demonstrate that we will support nuclear cooperation 
agreements only with those countries which have earned our trust, which 
have not aided our enemies, and which have consistently acted to 
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Russia meets none of these 
conditions, and we must not reward it for its actions that, either 
recklessly or deliberately, have greatly undermined the security of the 
American people and that of the world as a whole.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
