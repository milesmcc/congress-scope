Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to emphasize the fact that, 
until now, this debate has been, I think, very up-front and I hope we 
can keep it at that level. I would also say, I wonder if it is the 
position of the Democratic Party that Iran is not funding and supplying 
the insurgents in Iraq, because I think that was determined far before 
President Bush's administration made any comments about it.

With that, I would yield 7 minutes to my distinguished colleague and 
friend on the Homeland Security Committee, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).
