Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to echo the comments of my 
friends from Maryland and Oregon. The original Iraq Refugee Crisis Act 
included language similar to the conference report and the Cardin 
amendment to the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill. 
As the original author of the legislation, I can assure you it was my 
intention to provide Iraqi SIV recipients with the full array of 
benefits available to refugees. Moreover, SIV recipients are not to be 
counted against immigrant caps, nor are they counted against U.S. 
Refugee Admissions Program caps.
