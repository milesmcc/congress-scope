Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this fiscally 
irresponsible and misguided bill. While the bill includes many good 
provisions, it will also fund a massive troop surge in Afghanistan that 
will overburden our troops and will likely hurt, not help, our efforts 
to eliminate the global threat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates. 
And it is stuffed with earmarks and wasteful spending, such as $2.5 
billion for 10 C-17s that the Defense Department does not want and $130 
million for a Presidential helicopter program that has been cancelled.

While I will vote against the Defense appropriations bill, I am not 
going to be part of a partisan and cynical effort to delay passage of 
the Defense bill in order to block the Senate from considering health 
care reform. That is why I voted to end debate on the Defense 
appropriations bill, so the Senate could conduct a final vote on that 
bill and return to debating and voting on health care reform 
legislation.
