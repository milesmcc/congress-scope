`Mr. LEAHY â€” 18 December 2007`

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I came here at the time of the Vietnam war. 
I remember how people said maybe it should end and maybe we should do 
something; the Vietnam war has gone on too long. We finally stopped it. 
I am the only Vermonter ever to vote against the war in Vietnam. I 
voted against funding for it, and the funding failed in the Senate in 
April of 1975 by one vote. The war ended. Two years later, it was hard 
to find anybody who supported the war, even though we paid for it for a 
long time.

We have been in Iraq longer than we were in World War II. It is time 
to bring our brave men and women home. Let them be with their families 
and let the Iraqis take care of Iraq.

I yield the floor.
