Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the war in Iraq and I 
have always said that I would vote for additional war funding only if 
the bill contained a firm, responsible timeline to redeploy U.S. troops 
out of Iraq. On those grounds, and in accordance with the overwhelming 
sentiment I have heard from the people in my district, I could not in 
good conscience vote for the funding bill brought before the House this 
evening.
