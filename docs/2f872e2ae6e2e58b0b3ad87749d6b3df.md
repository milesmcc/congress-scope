Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, 
finally, but 4 years too late, the Bush administration, with Vice 
President Cheney's trip to Afghanistan, has recognized that the real 
war on terror is not Iraq; that Iraq has been a diversion against that 
war on terror; that, in fact, the real war on terror is in Pakistan and 
Afghanistan and in the border area. They are starting to discover that 
the Government of Pakistan has not been our friend as we have tried to 
stabilize Afghanistan and the Karzai government, as we have tried to 
build democracy in Afghanistan, as we have tried to root out the 
Taliban and al Qaeda; that, in fact, because of the diversion and our 
early leaving of Afghanistan for Iraq, that we have now allowed the al 
Qaeda to come back in command and control and to build their 
membership, to recruit around the world.

We have seen the Taliban come back into Afghanistan and start to 
threaten and overturn village leaders and democratically elected 
leaders in villages in various parts of Afghanistan. Only now, 4 years 
too late, does the Bush administration recognize that this is the real 
war on terror, and they have failed to fight it, failed to deal with it 
and failed to prepare for it. -
