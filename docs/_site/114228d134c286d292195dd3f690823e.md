Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time that I have come 
down to this well to demand that our troops come home and that we end 
the occupation of Iraq. In fact, I have come to the floor over 200 
times. And as the first Member of Congress to call on the


President to bring our troops home and the author of the first 
amendment on the floor requiring the President to bring a plan to the 
House on how he will end this debacle that he started, you can know 
that I am very pleased that this vote is before us today. Finally, 
after 4 years here we are.

Many of the provisions in the bill were included in H.R. 508, the 
Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act, a bill that 
I introduced with Representative Lee and Representative Waters. These 
provisions will fully fund bringing the troops home, prohibit permanent 
bases, give the Iraqi people sovereignty and a sense of hope for their 
future.

My colleagues, I urge you to support H.R. 2237. The American people 
are asking that we stand up for our troops, and we do that by fully 
funding them to bring them home. Bring them home to their families. 
Bring them home so that we can end this misguided occupation. By 
passing H.R. 2237, we will bring our troops and our military 
contractors out of Iraq safely.
