Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman would 
continue to yield, if in fact, I certainly hope the Iraqi Government is 
able to achieve the benchmarks, but if in fact, for whatever reason, 
they are unsuccessful in achieving the benchmarks and the Congress of 
the United States is to recontemplate elements of the supplemental and 
additional funding for the efforts in Iraq, does this gentleman's 
amendment appropriate dollars that are not subject to the specific 
requirements of the benchmarks established in the supplemental? Is this 
a funding in addition to that funding?
