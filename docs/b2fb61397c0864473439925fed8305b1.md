Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of delivering a 
knockout punch in Iraq, stabilizing Baghdad, securing freedom for the 
Iraqi people, and dealing a blow to terrorism across the Middle East.

There has been far too much politicking on this issue. Let me remind 
my colleagues that Iraq strategy is not about the legacy of Don 
Rumsfeld or General Abizaid or even President Bush. It is about 23 
million Iraqi people. It is about the citizens of the United States of 
America. It is about the future of the Middle East, and it is about the 
6 billion people on this planet who desire to live without the fear of 
radical terrorism.

We can achieve victory in Iraq. In the past we have underestimated 
the intensity of the death squads and the sectarian violence. Now we 
will confront them head on by ensuring we have enough coalition and 
Iraqi troops, not only to clear pockets of resistance, but to hold 
them.

Mr. Speaker, our President and combatant commanders are ready to 
deliver the knockout blow in Iraq. This is not the time for Congress to 
tie one hand behind their backs. We must be in this fight to win, and I 
support our drive to victory.
