Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3590. I wish 
to compliment Mr. Camp, Mr. Blumenauer, and everyone who's had a 
contribution to making this a very good bill. It's about teamwork. It's 
about making certain that our soldiers, our service men and women, have 
the support they need before, during, and after they've been deployed. 
And certainly everyone here would agree that our service men and women 
shouldn't be punished for going overseas to serve our Nation anyplace, 
let alone Iraq or Afghanistan.

In April of this year I received a telephone call from the Kavanaugh 
family. Jerry in Kaukauna called up to say he was concerned his son 
might not be able to take advantage of the first-time homebuyer tax 
credit of nearly $8,000. He wouldn't be able to take advantage of this 
because he was being deployed once more overseas.

Well, I think it's time to work together. We came up with a bill with 
Ron Kind to address this issue, and it has been improved upon by the 
Ways and Means Committee.

Over 1.4 million people have already taken advantage of the First-
Time HomeBuyer Act, and now it's a great opportunity for all service 
men and women to consider coming home and taking advantage of this 
opportunity to solidify not just their own home but the housing market 
here across the country.

I wish to honor all service men and women who have served overseas. I 
wish to thank as well Chairman Rangel; Representatives Boustany and 
Johnson, who also worked with me on preparing legislation that has been 
morphed into this act.

Again, I thank you for the hard work and teamwork to mend our Nation 
and make certain our service men and women are made whole when they 
return.
