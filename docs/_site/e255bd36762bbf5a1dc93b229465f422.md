Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Your points are 
well taken. After 4/1/2/ years of this tragic war, more than 3,600 
brave American troops killed, more than 26,000 injured, and nearly half 
a trillion dollars spent, we continue down the path that the President 
insists on taking us.

In his defiance, he has indicated he will continue to ignore reality, 
as well as the facts contained in the administration's own analysis of 
the war that was released today.

As you point out, in January, the President sent thousands of 
additional troops to Iraq and promised to hold the Iraqi government 
accountable for meeting those benchmarks for success. Today that report 
makes it clear that we need a change in course.

Unity in Iraq, we know here on this floor, must be determined by the 
people of Iraq, and our brave troops are caught in the crossfire of a 
sectarian civil war without a military mission, and the President has 
no plan to bring them home.

Instead of rejecting calls for change and demeaning those who seek 
it, the President should listen to the military experts, to Congress 
and the American people who in their will and wisdom want to 
responsibly redeploy the troops home.

With that, I would like to yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Arcuri).
