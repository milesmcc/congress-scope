Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I am honored this day to commend 
to the House the distinguished service of Sgt. William Patrick Treece 
for his sacrifices to his country on two different tours of duty. I 
would like to recognize Sgt. William Patrick Treece as his selection 
for Veteran of the Year 2008.

Sgt. Treece is a Findlay, Ohio resident. A 1988 graduate of Findlay 
High School, he has made a career of serving his country and his proud 
family of three children of the ages twelve, six, and three.

Sgt. Treece served his first tour of duty from 1989-1994 in the Gulf 
War; followed by a second tour from 2000-2005, serving in Iraq and 
Kuwait. He finished his service as a Police Sergeant.

The list of citations, honors, and medals awarded to Sgt. Treece is 
as long and distinguished as his active service to this Nation. He was 
awarded: the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Coast Guard Medal, Global 
War on Terrorism Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary 
Medal (Iraq), Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (Iraq), Sea Service 
Deployment Ribbon, Southwest Asia Service Medal (twice), Air Force 
Outstanding Unit Award, Presidential Unit Citation, National Defense 
Service Medal, Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait), and Navy Meritorious 
Unit Commendation.

I am honored to be one of the many to add my voice in recognizing, 
and commending, Sgt. Treece for his invaluable and distinguished 
service for his country. He is a shining example of our mutual 
responsibility to serve those who devoted their lives to protecting the 
freedoms we enjoy.
