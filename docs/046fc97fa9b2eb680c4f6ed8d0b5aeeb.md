Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I submit the following:

Requesting Member: Rep. Christopher H. Smith.

Bill Number: H.R. 2638.

Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Army Account.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: MILSPRAY Camouflage Technologies.

Address of Requesting Entity: 1985 Swarthmore Ave, Lakewood, NJ 
08701.

Description of Request: The Force Implementation Phase of this 
project is the final phase of ''Project Kryptolite--Field Deployable 
Multifunctional Stealth Coating.'' During Phase II, a complete turnkey 
''armor enhancement'' application system will be forward deployed to 
Iraq or other ARL-designated theater of operation. The completely 
integrated stealth coating system will be applied, in theater, to MRAP, 
Stryker, and other armored vehicles at the direction of Army and Marine 
Corps commanders. The Stealth Coating System addresses both infrared 
and thermal signature reduction as well as blast mitigation.

This system can act as an ''armor enhancement'' material and be 
applied over existing MRAP, and similar tactical vehicle, armor 
systems.

This armor enhancement approach would increase the level of blast 
resistance and substantially improve survivability. The use of this 
armor enhancement system will substantially reduce injuries and deaths 
resulting from IEDs, EFPs, and blast fragments. The material, and 
complete field deployable application system, will be forward deployed. 
MRAPs, Strykers, and other tactical vehicles will have the Kryptolite 
Armor Enhancement applied to them.



Proposed Funds Utilization: Logistics Support: $100,000 System/
Personnel Deployment Costs.

Salaries/Wages: $575,000 5-7 project technical personnel.

Equipment: $200,000 Lab, Test, Production, Application.
