`Mr. LEVIN â€” 25 October 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we mark the anniversary of a sad 
event. The tragic deaths 5 years ago of my friends, Paul and Sheila 
Wellstone. Yet I know that I join today the people of Minnesota and my 
colleagues here in the Senate in celebrating the lives they lived and 
the legacy they left behind.

Paul was a remarkable man who stood up in the Senate for those most 
in need of representation, the underpriviledged, the oppressed, and the 
mentally ill. He stood up and he never backed down.

Paul Wellstone was a man of great energy and passion, seemingly 
always in motion, but never too busy to have a word with people he 
would come across in the corridors or in the elevators, never too busy 
to take a moment to talk with the tourists in the Capitol, Senate 
workers, or the constituents of other Senators. For this, he was 
beloved by the many people who serve us here in the Senate and the many 
others he touched. We all miss his eloquence, and his humor, but, most 
of all, we miss this man of warmth and caring.

When that plane crashed in northern Minnesota 5 years ago, his 
beloved State, the Senate, and the Nation were deprived of a wise and 
thoughtful leader. When I stood on the Senate floor to pay tribute to 
Paul Wellstone shortly after the accident, I pointed out that one of 
his last acts in the Senate was a vote against the war in Iraq. I 
recalled his speech then. But now, 5 years later, after the painful 
course which that war has taken, his words ring even more true. He saw 
and understood the first of the series of mistakes made in Iraq. He 
said, ''Acting now on our own might be a sign of our power. Acting 
sensibly and in a measured way, in concert with our allies with 
bipartisan congressional support, would be a sign of our strength.''

Paul never feared to fight for what he believed, even when in a small 
minority like his vote against the welfare reform bill in 1996, and his 
battles against the bankruptcy bill, and on behalf of more equitable 
funding for the victims of mental illness.

My wife Barbara and I often think of our friends, Paul and Sheila 
Wellstone, and the good times we shared. Because of those enduring 
memories, we celebrate their lives on this anniversary, in much the 
spirit that they lived, with a smile in our hearts.
