`Mr. BIDEN â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will make a very detailed speech after 
this vote laying out why I think this vote is important.

We started down this road, and we have been banging away since the 
Biden-Hagel-Levin-Snowe resolution back in January, to the Biden-Levin 
position, and now the Reed-Levin amendment, all of which are 
essentially the same thing. I want to make it clear that this is simply 
a first step. We have to keep from careening off this highway and get 
out of the civil war, and then we have to be in a position where we 
come up with a political solution so that when we leave Iraq and we 
bring our children home, we don't just send our grandchildren back.

I thank my colleagues for giving me this time, and as I said, when 
the vote is over and there is more time, I will, as passionately as I 
can, try to clarify what I think the situation is that we find 
ourselves in in Iraq and what our overall policy--not just the Levin-
Reed amendment but what else we must be doing.

I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague for his generosity, and I 
yield the floor.
