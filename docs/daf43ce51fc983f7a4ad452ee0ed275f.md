Mrs. KIRKPATRICK of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House 
Joint Resolution 47. This is the House joint resolution for the 
constitutional amendment to ban the burning of the American flag.

For 232 years, the Stars and Stripes have been a unique symbol of 
freedom and democracy across the world. It is the embodiment of all we 
are and of all we stand for as a Nation. Millions of our young men and 
women, including my father and uncles, bravely and selflessly defended 
their country under that flag. Every day, our servicemembers risk their 
lives in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the globe to protect the ideals 
it represents.

To burn or to desecrate our flag, even in political protest, is an 
affront to the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for 
our freedom and to the many others who have served.

I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution. I urge all of my 
colleagues, regardless of party, to join me.
