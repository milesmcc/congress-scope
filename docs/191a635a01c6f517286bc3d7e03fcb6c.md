Mr. BOREN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the inclusion of 
Davis-Bacon in H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. I was 
absent for the vote taken on this legislation on March 9, 2007, because 
I was leading a House Armed Services Committee delegation to Iraq. I 
wish to state for the record that, had I been present for this vote, I 
would have supported the inclusion of Davis-Bacon language in H.R. 720. 
The Davis-Bacon Act, which dates back to 1931, requires every 
construction contract in excess of two thousand dollars to which the 
federal government is a party to pay all laborers and mechanics not 
less than the locally prevailing wage. I believe it is important for 
Oklahomans that federal contracts are not awarded to firms that seek to 
undercut the prevailing wages paid in our region. Government contracts 
should not be won by sacrificing fair wage rates for Oklahoma workers. 
For these reasons, I have supported the passage of Davis-Bacon in the 
past and would have also supported it on March 9th as part of the Water 
Quality Financing Act.
