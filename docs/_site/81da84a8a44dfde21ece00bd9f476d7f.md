`Mr. REID â€” 15 November 2007`

Mr. REID. I say to my friend, it is my intention to come in in the 
morning at 8:30. That would allow any Senators who wish to talk about 
the farm bill and Iraq to do that tonight and in the morning we have a 
few speakers and you would have some speakers, and that should conclude 
the events tomorrow. I think we need to come in early because we have 
had a number of requests, as you know.

I do say this, I appreciate the understanding of my friends on the 
other side. As they know, there is a debate tonight of all Democratic 
Presidential candidates, and they needed to be here in the morning. 
That is required. They probably needed the time anyway, but I couldn't 
push forward on that tonight, especially with the debate starting in 2 
hours in Las Vegas.
