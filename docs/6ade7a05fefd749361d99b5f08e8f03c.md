`Mr. SALAZAR â€” 9 March 2007`

---


Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, yesterday we resumed reading the names of 
our servicemembers on this House floor that have paid the ultimate 
sacrifice in this war. To date, 3,188 American servicemembers have lost 
their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I am greatly saddened today to 
add the name of Specialist Blake Harris to that list of the fallen 
soldiers.

Specialist Harris was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters 
Company, 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, 
Fort Hood, Texas.

Specialist Harris died on Monday, March 5, in Baqubah, Iraq, of 
injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near 
his patrol.

Blake Harris was born and raised in Pueblo, Colorado. He was a 2002 
graduate of Pueblo South High School.

In Pueblo, Blake leaves behind a loving wife, Joanna; a 2-year-old 
son, Jonah; and his mother, Deborah Harris. He is also survived by his 
father, John Harris of Denver.

Madam Speaker, I extend my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his 
family and friends who have suffered this loss, and I pray for their 
comfort and strength in their time of greatest need.

Specialist Harris was a proud and courageous soldier whose story must 
never be forgotten. Blake Harris was 22 years old.

Madam Speaker, I submit this recognition to the United States House 
of Representatives in honor of his sacrifice so that the memory of 
Blake Harris may live on forever.
