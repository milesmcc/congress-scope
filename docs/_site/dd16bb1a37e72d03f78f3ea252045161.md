Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on this upcoming final day in May we 
will observe Memorial Day, and remember the men and women in uniform 
who have loved this country and given their lives to defend it. 
Memorial Day is a time to honor their extraordinary sacrifice.

We have a proud tradition of service in my home State of Kentucky, 
home to Fort Knox, Fort Campbell and many of our brave troops. Just a 
few days ago soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, based out of 
Fort Campbell, cased their colors in preparation for deployment to 
Afghanistan. Training the local police force will be a major focus for 
this mission, the fourth deployment for the division headquarters since 
9/11.

More than 10,000 men and women from the 101st are already deployed to 
Afghanistan, and by the end of August that number will reach 20,000.

In addition, about 3,500 soldiers from the Army's 3rd Brigade Combat 
Team, based at Fort Knox, are preparing to deploy to Afghanistan soon, 
as are up to about 2,000 Kentucky Army and Air National Guard members.

Five soldiers from the 101st have died in Afghanistan since January. 
Every soldier preparing to ship out faces that same risk, but that does 
not deter them from duty and service. They are working to keep their 
families back home and all Americans safe.

I have met with many of the family members of soldiers, sailors and 
marines from Kentucky who gave their lives in service. I have let them 
know that their loved ones will not be forgotten by this country. And 
they are not forgotten in the U.S. Senate. We are honored to share this 
land with such brave heroes.

Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.
