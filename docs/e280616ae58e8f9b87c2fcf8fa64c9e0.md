Mr. OBEY. I thank the gentleman for his very wise comments.

Let me simply say that I don't have any objection to several 
provisions in this motion. I do have to say one thing, however. The 
effect of this motion would be to substantially increase the likely 
amount of money approved by the conference for the Defense Department, 
and to substantially reduce the amount of money provided for the State 
Department.

I have always had difficulty understanding why people are willing to 
spend hundreds of billions of dollars to wage war but are resistant to 
spending a tiny amount in comparison in order to prevent war or to 
extricate ourselves from war. In fact, the conference report that is 
likely to come back will probably exceed the numbers in this motion for 
bringing State Department personnel more immediately into Iraq, into 
Afghanistan and into Pakistan. We are trying to convert that operation 
from, essentially, a military operation to a much more balanced 
operation, which includes much greater effort on the diplomatic side to 
extricate ourselves from that war. That requires money. It requires 
facilities. As many military experts have said, you cannot win this if 
you just deal with it militarily.

So, with that one point, I would simply say, Madam Speaker, that I 
would reserve the balance of my time until the gentleman is ready to 
close.
