`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 25 April 2007`

---


Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I want to read it one more time, Mr. 
Altmire, just because it backs up everything you said. I want to read 
it one more time. Secretary Gates. ''The strong feelings expressed in 
the Congress about the timetable probably have had a positive impact in 
terms of communicating to the Iraqis this is not an open ended 
commitment.'' I mean, that's worth saying again, because for all the 
rhetoric that we get about what we are doing here and what kind of 
impact it has in Iraq, we have our Secretary of Defense telling us 
exactly what has been our intuition for years; that the only way, Mr. 
Altmire, just like you said, the only way for us to exert any pressure 
on the Iraqis to stand up for themselves, to get their military shop in 
order, to get their civil shop in order, to get their political stop in 
order, is to tell them that we are not going to be the crutch that they 
can rely on in the long run. We've recognized that here for a very long 
time. Our Secretary of Defense now joins us in that.

And at this point I would like to turn it over, yield to Mr. Hodes.
