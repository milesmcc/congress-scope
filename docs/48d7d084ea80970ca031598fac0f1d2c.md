Mr. GREGG. Responding to the Senator through the Chair, the Senator 
makes a good point. My big concern goes to the morale of the troops in 
the field. What are they thinking? What are they thinking as a young 
19-, 20-, 22-year-old soldier in Iraq today when they hear this 
discourse going forward and they are asked to go out on patrol, and 
they are told that maybe the troops their military leadership says it 
needs to support them is an issue? It is a legitimate issue as to how 
long we should allow this to hang out there. Let's have the debate. 
Let's resolve our national position as to what it is going to be, at 
least for the next year, if we get that far, and resolve it so that we 
know where we are; otherwise, we do harm to our national policy, 
because it is so disruptive to have this many voices at the same time 
claiming legitimacy and, more importantly, it does harm to our troops 
in the field, which is my primary concern.

I thank the Senator from Texas for his questions and yield the floor.
