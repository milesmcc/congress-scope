Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have the responsibility to pay tribute 
to a soldier from my home State of Iowa who has fallen in the line of 
duty. SPC Adrian Hike was killed while serving his country in 
Afghanistan. He was assigned to A Troop, 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry 
Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade.

My prayers go out to his mother and father in Iowa and all his family 
and friends. I understand that his loss has come as a shock to those 
living in and around Sac City where Adrian attended high school. I know 
that many Iowans will be saddened to learn of his fate.

At the same time, we can be very proud to call him a fellow Iowan. 
Specialist Hike was wounded in Iraq, receiving the Purple Heart. After 
several surgeries, he returned to duty and was even talking about 
reenlisting. This kind of selfless dedication to our Armed Forces and 
our country is what has kept us free since the founding of our Nation.

Adrian Hike's honorable service and tremendous sacrifice on behalf of 
the United States of America should never be forgotten. His was a true 
patriot and deserves to be remembered as such.
