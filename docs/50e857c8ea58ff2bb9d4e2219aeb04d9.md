Mr. RENZI. Madam Speaker, a good friend of mine, Neill Sachs, 
recently wrote me about a co-worker of his, an Iraq veteran, Specialist 
Bryan Anderson. In late 2005, Specialist Anderson's Humvee was struck 
by a roadside bomb while driving in Baghdad. Specialist Anderson lost 
both of his legs and most of his left arm as a result of the blast.

Anderson was sent to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for 
rehabilitation. After spending over a year of intensive and grueling 6 
hours a day, 5 days a week therapy sessions, Specialist Anderson has 
returned home to Illinois to a heartfelt hero's welcome.

He will undoubtedly require treatment for the rest of his life, and 
he will need our financial and medical support. As we begin our work in 
the 110th Congress, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
work together and ensure that our servicemembers, such as Specialist 
Anderson, are given the medical care, benefits, and the tools they need 
to succeed in civilian life.

I am deeply grateful for Specialist Anderson and the other men and 
women in our Armed Services.
