Mr. AKIN. You talked about the TEA party. We were flushing a little 
tea down the Mississippi River from St. Louis. We had a TEA party, too, 
and I don't know whether that's gotten down to Louisiana yet. But we 
had the same thing. We have people saying, Wait a minute. This spending 
is out of control. Some of the money that we had on the chart here has 
already been spent. But there is a tremendous amount more spending that 
is being proposed. And we don't have to keep spending.

We did the $300-some billion bank bailout. That water is over the dam 
or down the river, however you want to look at it. And that porkulus 
bill at almost $800 billion, you know, you're talking about more than 
the war in Iraq and Afghanistan added together. We're talking about 
just 5 weeks here in the Chamber, and we have gone hugely into debt.

I am on Armed Services. One of the most expensive things we buy on my 
committee is aircraft carriers. We have 11 of them in the U.S.A., and 
this bill, for $800 billion, we could get 250 aircraft carriers. End-
to-end I can't even imagine how many aircraft carriers that would be. 
We only have 11. The debt service and the money would buy 9 brand new 
aircraft carriers. We're talking a lot of money, and the American 
public is starting to get wise to this deal.
