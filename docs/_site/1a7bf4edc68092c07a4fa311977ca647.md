Mr. EMANUEL. There has been a lot of news on Iraq and the differing 
strategy between Congress and the President. Let's be clear about where 
the differences lie.

The administration wants more time after 4 long years in Iraq; 
Democrats say it's time for a conclusion to the open-ended commitment. 
The administration wants 25,000 more troops for Iraq; Democrats are 
calling for the troops to be fully trained and equipped. The 
administration wants more money; Democrats are demanding Iraqis be held 
accountable for Iraq's future.

The administration policy has us policing a civil war; Democrats want 
to focus on al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The administration has failed our 
veterans on the health care they earned; Democrats are for making sure 
that the veterans get the health care they deserve.

As Yogi Berra once said, ''When you come to a fork in the road, take 
it.'' Madam Speaker, the President wants and is asking for more of the 
same; Democrats are calling for a new direction.
