Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the purpose of the President's escalation 
of the war in Iraq was to provide the Iraqi government with the space 
and security they needed to make real political progress. 
Unfortunately, it does not appear that meaningful progress has been 
made. General Petraeus has publicly admitted that the hope he once had 
that Iraqi leaders would take advantage of the U.S. troop surge efforts 
to minimize violence and make political gains ''has not worked out as 
we had hoped.'' Despite the lack of progress, General Petraeus 
continues to want to stay the failed course. He has asked that the 
current levels of troops be kept in place until spring 2008.

Violence might be slightly diminishing in provinces where the 
presence of U.S. troops have been increased by the surge, but an 
increase of deaths and sectarian violence by car bombs and suicide 
bombers has increased in other provinces. The last 3 months have 
claimed the lives of 264 U.S. troops in Iraq, making it the deadliest 
summer of the war so far. Since the war began, 3,759 U.S. troops have 
been killed. More than 27,770 have been wounded in combat. In the 32nd 
Congressional District, 14 brave service members have given the 
ultimate sacrifice.

A number of recent reports on Iraq contain findings which are 
different than the testimony delivered today by General Petraeus and 
Ambassador Crocker. A Government Accountability Office report on Iraq 
shows that the Iraqi government has failed to meet 15 of 18 benchmarks 
for success. A report by retired Marine GEN James Jones found that Iraq 
is still far from being able to take over its own security 
responsibilities. This report also indicates that the Iraqi Interior 
Ministry, which runs the security forces, is ''dysfunctional,''


and recommends that the national police force be disbanded.

I find these reports to be even more disturbing considering the 
overwhelming costs of the war. Congress has already appropriated nearly 
$565 billion for the war in Iraq since March 2003, at a rate of 
approximately $10 billion per month in Iraq. This has cost the 
taxpayers of the 32nd Congressional District an estimated $1.1 billion. 
This money could have provided health care coverage for 447,203 
individuals or college scholarships for 167,215 students.

The American people are frustrated and want a new direction in Iraq 
and an end to the war. According to a poll by the New York Times, 78 
percent of Americans believe the U.S. should reduce its current level 
of troops or the withdrawal of all troops from Iraq. A USA Today poll 
shows that 6 percent of Americans would like for the U.S. to set a 
timetable to withdraw our forces from Iraq and stick to that timetable.

I agree. This grave situation requires a policy to secure and 
stabilize Iraq, one that constructively engages in diplomacy and 
partners with neighboring countries and the region to create a stable 
and peaceful nation, not a blank check to send more men and women into 
harm's way. We must resist establishment of permanent U.S. military 
bases in Iraq and train Iraqis to secure and run Iraq. Although I 
strongly disagree with the policies that continue to endanger our 
servicemen and women, I stand firmly behind them and look forward to 
their redeployment and safe return home.
