Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield further for a question, I would 
like to ask the Senator--I have been told that using the definition of 
''czar'' that Mr. Beck, political adviser to some, and Senator 
Hutchison, and even you use, that under President George W. Bush, the 
previous Republican administration, one could characterize his 
officials and advisers in the Executive Office of the President and 
other agencies as an Afghanistan czar, an AIDS czar, a drug czar, a 
faith-based czar, an intelligence czar, a Mideast peace czar, a 
regulatory czar, a science czar, a Sudan czar, a TARP bailout czar, a 
terrorism czar, and a weapons czar, under the previous administration. 
I ask the Senator from Maine if she proposed this amendment under a 
Republican President who clearly had his own stable of Muscovite czars 
of a lot of different versions?
