Mr. BOYD of Florida. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for 
yielding.

Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the last GI Bill was written after 
World War II, and 64 years later we're passing a new expanded GI Bill 
that will provide important education benefits for our veterans. Simply 
put, ladies and gentlemen, it's the right thing to do.

In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, our guardsmen and our reservists 
have been used and deployed by our Commander in Chief at a level that 
we haven't seen since World War II. Many of these guardsmen and 
reservists were in a career profession before these wars, and many will 
come home unable to continue that career profession because of physical 
or mental injuries sustained during their service in that war.

This GI Bill will restore the promise of a full 4-year education for 
our benefits, 60 years since the last one was written, and make the 
veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan part of the American economic recovery 
efforts just as the veterans of World War II were.

I want to thank the Speaker and the House leadership for bringing 
this bill to the floor.
