Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, at this time, I would like to 
recognize one of my distinguished constituents, SPC Russell W. Byers, 
who has recently been honored with the Army Commendation Medal from the 
Department of the Army.

SPC Russell W. Byers is attached to the Headquarters Battery, 1st 
Battalion of the 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment. He was 
awarded this citation by the Secretary of the Army for ''Meritorious 
service during combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom.'' The award further commends Specialist Byers, stating ''Your 
Tactical and technical proficiency, hard work and mission dedication 
have greatly contributed to the overall mission success of the task 
force. Your actions reflect great credit upon you, Task Force Panther 
and the United States Army.''

This is Specialist Byers' first commendation, and was presented to 
him after a one year tour in Iraq. Duties he performed to receive this 
high honor include being an expert on the Command Post of the Future 
(CPOF) computer system, where he gathered, analyzed and developed vital 
intelligence for the Task Force. In addition, he gathered intelligence 
from HUMINT, prepared summarized reports and organized data, 
maintaining a complex database that captured all the significant enemy 
activity within the Task Force's combat zone.

In the recommendation letter for this medal, Specialist Byers' 
superior officer wrote, ''SPC Byers' ability to multi-task and present 
information in a clear and consistent manner is of the highest military 
standards. He is extremely diligent and competent in accomplishing all 
assigned tasks with little or no supervision, while producing dynamic 
results. SPC Byers leads the way with a 'can do' attitude and an 
outstanding drive to go the distance, even when it requires him to go 
above and beyond his assigned scope of duties and responsibilities. He 
is well ahead of his peers in military bearing and fortitude.''

I am well aware that there are thousands upon thousands of soldiers, 
airmen, Marines and sailors that earn prestigious citations such as 
this, but I am excited that a proud son from West Texas is among them.

Congratulations SPC Russell W. Byers; you have served your country 
with distinction. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of a 
grateful Nation, and especially your neighbors in the 19th 
Congressional District. We all sleep well every night, knowing 
dedicated people like you are defending all we hold dear.
