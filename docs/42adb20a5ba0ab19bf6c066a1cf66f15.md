`Mr. BOOZMAN â€” 5 September 2007`

Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a young man beloved 
by his family, friends and his community. I rise to remember Specialist 
Tyler Ross Seideman of the United States Army who was taken from us 2 
weeks ago today in Multaka, Iraq.

Tyler and 13 of his Army brothers passed away when the Black Hawk he 
was in went down due to mechanical problems. Tyler, from the small town 
of Lincoln, Arkansas, was a sniper in the 2nd Battalion of the 35th 
Infantry Regiment based out of Hawaii. His closest friends described 
him with adjectives such as ''brave,'' a ''great soldier'' and a 
''perfect gentleman.''

I had the opportunity to attend Tyler's funeral this past Saturday. 
The outpouring of love and support from the people of Lincoln is 
something I will remember for the rest of my life.

My prayers and those of my family are with Tyler's parents, Bill and 
Lee Ann, and sisters Kiera and Kristen. I thank them for raising a man 
such as Tyler, and I thank Tyler for his service to a grateful Nation.
