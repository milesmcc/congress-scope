Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, with an economic slowdown looming and 
the war in Iraq draining billions of dollars in public resources every 
week, a strong Federal budget will give families the help they need to 
weather tough times and prepare for a prosperous future.

A budget that invests in America's future will direct federal funding 
to where it's needed most, especially health care, education, housing, 
nutrition, job training and other priorities that promote economic 
growth and expand opportunity.

A budget resolution that invests in America's future will include 
bold new investments in high-quality, affordable health care; strong 
public education; infrastructure and the development of clean energy 
sources to end our dependence on foreign oil. It also means an end to 
the costly war in Iraq, and the repeal of President Bush's 
irresponsible tax breaks for those who don't need or want them.



We should also be providing tax relief and help to struggling 
families and veterans; increase homeland security funding; and reject 
the President's cuts to our first responders.

A budget that invests in America's future will succeed only with 
broad support in Congress. I encourage my distinguished colleagues to 
support this proposed budget to rebuild America's future.
