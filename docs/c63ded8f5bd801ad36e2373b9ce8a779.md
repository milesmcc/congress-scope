Ms. SNOWE. I want to express my appreciation to the Senator from 
Virginia, because I do think this resolution reinforces the position of 
those of us who oppose the troop surge. I couldn't agree with the 
Senator more about the concerns we have involving the sectarian strife, 
particularly at a time in which the Iraqi Government has not 
demonstrated the political resoluteness to confront its own militias, 
to disarm and demobilize them, to proceed with a political process that 
would advance in unifying the country. That is long overdue. The time 
has come for the Iraqi Government and its people to step up and assume 
those responsibilities. That is why I had for the last few months the 
deep concern about the increase in the level of troops at a time in 
which sectarian strife has enveloped the country.

It is time for the Iraqi Government, the Iraqi Army to begin to 
proceed to take responsibility for the internal problems that are 
developing. We obviously should move in a different direction and place 
the pressure on them to do what is right.
