Mr. GREGG. I rise this morning on behalf of Kathy and myself to 
express our deepest sympathies to the family of CPL Michael Ouellette. 
Corporal Ouellette died in Afghanistan last week, and his funeral is 
today. I have spoken with his mother, and, of course, he was an 
exceptional individual. These young men who serve us in the military 
are all exceptional. He served two tours of duty in Iraq, was 
decorated, and then went to Afghanistan to serve again.

On behalf of the people of New Hampshire and our Nation, I thank his 
parents for having raised such an extraordinary child. We appreciate 
and thank them for the service he has given this Nation, and we 
obviously express our deepest concern during this extremely difficult 
period.
