Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I was at the White House this afternoon with 
several of my colleagues to brief the President on our recent trip to 
Iraq. As a result, I was absent from the House Floor during a series of 
rollcall votes.

Had I been present, I would have voted ''aye'' on rollcalls 734, 735, 
736, 737, 738, 739, 740, 741, and 742.
