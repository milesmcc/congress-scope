Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, by refusing to take responsibility for their 
failed policy in Iraq, the Bush administration has effectively forced 
Congress to intervene to bring it to a responsible end.

Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Obey, Majority Whip Clyburn, Chairman Murtha 
and the Democratic leadership do deserve credit for recognizing this 
and for doing something that the Republican Congress refused to do over 
the last 4 years, namely, that is to confront the Bush administration 
over their failed policy and to commit to bring that policy to an end 
in Iraq.

But that is a very important step. However, for some of us the 
question of voting for funds to continue this war with strings attached 
and no real enforcement really does keep our troops in harm's way. I am 
disappointed we will not have the opportunity to vote on the Lee-
Woolsey-Waters-Watson amendment which would fully fund the safe 
withdrawal of U.S. troops and contractors by December 31, 2007.



The American people want this, and I will continue to push to fully 
fund the safe withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and for timelines for 
withdrawal that are backed up, mind you, backed up by the 
appropriations power, and that is the power of the purse which the 
Constitution grants to the Congress. Too many lives have been lost, too 
many lives have been shattered.
