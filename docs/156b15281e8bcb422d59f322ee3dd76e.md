# WAR SUPPLEMENTAL IS BAD POLITICS, BAD POLICY

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. And I appreciate the gentleman's comments. And I also 
want to thank the gentleman from Georgia for allowing us this time 
tonight.

I think I would leave you and leave the American people not with my 
words and not with Members of Congress or even General Petraeus or some 
of the other military leaders, but I will leave you with the words I 
started off the evening with in my time here is the words of the young 
men and women that are boots on the ground, that have served not one 
tour, but two tours, and many of them three tours, when they looked me 
in my eye and they said, ''Congressman, we want to go home. We want to 
spend time with our families. We want to go back to our communities. 
But, Congressman, we have a lot invested in this war, probably more 
than anyone else, and let us finish this job.''

And so I urge my colleagues to listen to these young brave men and 
women that are doing phenomenal things for our country and for the 
people in Iraq. Listen to the soldiers: Let's finish this job.
