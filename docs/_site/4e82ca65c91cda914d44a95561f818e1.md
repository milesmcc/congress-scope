Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator 
from Nebraska for his leadership on this issue and his support for this 
amendment. It is my firm hope that people on the other side of the 
aisle will understand this amendment for what it is and, no matter what 
their views of the propriety of the war in Iraq or the direction of the 
President's strategy, will understand this is a minimum bottom line in 
terms of how the U.S. military is used around the world.

For the record, Senator Hagel and I, to my knowledge, are the only 
veterans of ground combat in Vietnam in this body. It is a privilege 
and a pleasure to have him with me on this amendment.

I yield the floor.
