Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Speaker, today tens of thousands of our young men and women are 
serving in uniform heading for Iraq. More are headed there as we speak. 
They will do what American soldiers do. They will serve our Nation with 
courage and pride, and for that they deserve our deep gratitude.

Today in the House we are engaging in a debate on a resolution that 
declares their military and humanitarian missions failed. I have seen 
this resolution described in the press as symbolic, toothless and 
meaningless. I couldn't disagree more. Our consideration of this 
resolution, the words spoken on this floor, carry great meaning and 
weight.

The actions of this body have consequences. When Members speak, the 
world listens: our friends, our allies, our rivals, our enemies and 
future enemies alike. What are they hearing?

I remember just 2 weeks ago, during the Super Bowl, seeing the video 
of our troops in Baghdad watching the game. Our soldiers watched that 
game. Every Member on this floor should know with certainty that our 
soldiers surely are watching this debate, and so are their families, 
and so are our enemies and so are the loved ones of those who made the 
ultimate sacrifice in their service to our Nation.

Instead of showcasing the best partisan rhetoric and working for 
political advantage, we should be working together with our Commander 
in Chief to honor their service and commitment, to find a way forward 
in Iraq that protects our Nation and results in a stable Iraq that can 
govern and protect itself.

I know that none of us are happy with the progress of the war. I know 
that the American people are struggling with this war. I struggle too. 
I am reminded that we have been sent here by our constituents to 
exercise our best judgment and to bring our experience to bear on the 
most pressing issue facing our Nation, the global threat of a radical 
Islamic fundamentalism.

Last week in the House Appropriations Committee on Defense, on which 
I serve, I asked the chiefs of staff of the Army about the consequences 
of failure in Iraq. I was reprimanded for getting off topic. But that 
is the topic. That is the point. Withdrawal from Iraq will have 
consequences, both immediate and in the seeds of future conflicts.

What will Congress do if we leave Iraq to flounder and descend into 
chaos, and how will we handle the next challenge laid before us, for 
there will be others. Do any of us doubt the determination of forces 
who are counting on our failure, on our resolve? This is the most 
fundamental question that confronts us, not solely the question of 
troop reinforcement that is already under way. Our answer to this 
question will be the legacy, not just of this President, but of all of 
us in this Chamber.

Over 35 years ago I served with the Army in Vietnam. While I never 
much advertised this fact, I was proud to serve, even as my father, 
then a Member of Congress himself, was subject to many personal attacks 
on the home front from those who opposed the Vietnam War.

Like many soldiers then, I wanted to do my time and come back safely. 
I promised myself one day that if I had the chance, I would be a better 
person, a better elected official, for that military experience. I 
promised myself that I would never let our soldiers down wherever they 
might be.

Madam Speaker, we are Americans first, and as Republicans and 
Democrats, we need to come together to work on solutions in Iraq and 
the Middle East. We are a Nation at war, lives are on the line, and we 
could do much better than this resolution.
