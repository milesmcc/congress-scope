Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to addressing the most 
important issues currently facing our Nation, the Republicans in this 
body are once again all talk and no action. Despite overwhelming public 
opposition to President Bush's open-ended commitment in Iraq, despite 
thousands of lives lost and hundreds of billions of dollars of 
taxpayers money spent, Republicans still won't actually take action to 
end this war.

Oh, they talk a good game. They say they are listening to the retired 
generals, the soldiers and the American people who want our troops 
brought home. A few of them even went to the White House a few weeks 
ago to vent their frustration over the war in Iraq and the President's 
leadership.

But when it comes to actually moving to send President Bush a message 
that this Congress is moving the war in the right direction, my 
colleagues on the other side the aisle do what they always do; they 
line up and vote with their leadership and with President Bush.

Mr. Speaker, despite their claims, Republicans still want to write 
blank checks and rubber-stamp the President's policy. While they wait, 
Democrats are moving forward with our commitment to making serious 
changes in Iraq.
