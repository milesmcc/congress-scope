`Mr. McCAIN â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. McCAIN. The Senator and I also went together and saw at that time 
how Ramadi and Fallujah were basically battlegrounds of enormous 
proportions. Isn't it true that recently both Ramadi--particularly 
Ramadi, but also Fallujah is a basically secure area. The last time 
there has been an attack at Ramadi--they have gone many days. Yet 
somehow that escapes the notice of some of our colleagues.

In fact, I don't know if my friend from South Dakota is, is aware of 
what Lieutenant General Lamb, the British lieutenant general, the 
deputy commander of Multi-National Force, said the other day when the 
growing sentiment in our Congress to bring U.S. troops home sooner 
affected the mood of troops deployed in Iraq.

He said: I find it a touch difficult because it was so clear to them 
that we are making progress. It is not reflected by those who are not 
in the fight but are sitting back and making judgment upon what they, 
the troops, can see with absolute clarity.

I guess my question for the Senator from South Dakota is, Is there a 
disconnect between the rhetoric we hear and all of this stuff about how 
we are losing--and the majority leader of the Senate said we had lost--
and the realities on the ground as reflected by the men and who are 
fighting?
