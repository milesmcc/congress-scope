Mr. REED. Mr. President, Senator Levin has very eloquently pointed 
out the premise of the President's surge strategy; that was to provide 
the political space so that the Iraqi Government could essentially 
begin a reconciliation among its own people, begin to function 
effectively. Little or none of that has happened.

What has happened is that the violence has been reduced. That is 
commendable. It is attributable to several factors; first, the increase 
of American forces there and the way they have been deployed very 
adroitly by our military commanders; secondly, the fact that 
coincidentally but propitiously in Anbar Province, Sunni tribesmen have 
finally figured out that al-Qaida is as much a threat to them as to 
anyone else, particularly Americans. They have banded together with us 
to attack al-Qaida elements there. How long that relationship of 
convenience lasts is a question that has not been resolved.

Within Baghdad, there has been significant ethnic cleansing. In fact, 
we recall just weeks ago, refugees started coming back. They were told 
by the Government in Baghdad: Do not come back. You are going to 
provoke another destabilizing situation. That ethnic cleansing is one 
other factor.

Sadr, the leader of the Shia in the South, one of the purported 
leaders in the South, has basically told his Mahdi army to stand down 
for 6 months so he can reorganize, so he can regroup, so when he feels 
the moment is right he is in a much more powerful position to strike.

Then the administration has finally embraced some diplomatic efforts; 
quietly, I think, with the Iranians, much more publicly with the 
Syrians and others. All of those factors together have contributed to 
this reduced violence.

But here is one of the most significant and salient facts we have to 
recognize: The surge is over. Our force structure will not allow a 
continuation of 160,000 American forces in Iraq beyond the middle of 
this year, beyond this summer. That is not because some politician in 
Washington said so, that is because the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, because the Chief of Staff of the Army understand that the 
operational tempo will not allow that.

The question before us is: Well, what is the strategy now? Is the 
strategy coming here and asking for billions of dollars every 3 or 4 
months? Asking for troops that cannot be actively or effectively 
provided, because our force structure is too small?

The essence of this amendment, an amendment that Senator Levin and I 
and others have been pursuing for months now, is to focus on a strategy 
that can be sustained and supported so we can do what we must do. That 
strategy, in our view, boils down to three very specific missions: Go 
after the terrorists, the al-Qaida people, wherever they are; train 
Iraqi security forces to support their country, because ultimately the 
Iraqi people and their leaders will decide whether their country will 
survive and prosper, not American forces; and, finally, protect our 
forces on the ground.

Those are three discrete missions that can be done, should be done. 
There is no attempt in this amendment to cut off funding. There is an 
attempt, though, to focus our policy on a strategy that will work over 
time. What we have here is no simple situation in which you have got an 
al-Qaida rogue group we are going after. This is a very complicated 
situation.

Ultimately at the heart of this, it is a political struggle between 
Sunni, Shia, and Kurds; Sunnis, who feel a profound sense of 
entitlement which has been frustrated by our operations over there, and 
the departure of the Baathist regime; Shia, who feel profoundly 
paranoid because they suffered grievously under that regime; and Kurds, 
who want their autonomy.

These political forces have to be settled. They will only be settled 
internally by the Iraqis standing up. This amendment will help direct 
that policy, force them to recognize we are not there indefinitely with 
a blank check. It will also guide our forces to missions that we can 
perform, that will be essential to our security and will allow us, I 
believe, to do what we can to help that country stabilize itself.

This is a message. It is a message to the troops that we are going to 
adopt a wise, sustainable policy that is worthy of their sacrifice. It 
is a message, I hope, to the President that he cannot come back here 
every 6 months and ask for 5, 10, 50, 70, 80, $100 billion. It is a 
message to the Iraqi politicians that they must seize this moment.

I urge passage.
