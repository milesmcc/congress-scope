Mr. HUNTER. I just wanted to thank the gentlelady for, respectfully, 
for her addition to this amendment and her concern about the 
contractors. And you know, just reflect for a second, that our 
contractors who go over to the warfighting theaters in Iraq and 
Afghanistan undertake enormous danger, and a large number of them have 
been killed and wounded. And many of them, the ones that I have met, 
are largely American veterans who have, they go for two reasons; one is 
they do make good money. It's a job, it's a worthwhile job. They feel 
like they're supporting our country. They also have a great, the ones 
I've talked to, have a great deal of concern for the troops. They have 
a feeling of partnership with the people that wear the uniform of the 
United States, and they are a great asset to this country. And I think 
it's appropriate that we follow, we carefully watch how they're treated 
and how they're protected. I think that's absolutely appropriate.

I thank the chairman for embedding this base provision in the base 
bill, and


members on the Republican and Democrat side who've worked to put this 
together, and I thank the gentlelady for her thoughtful addition.
