Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I oppose the fiscal year 2008 Defense 
authorization conference report because it does nothing to end the 
President's misguided, open-ended Iraq policy, which has overburdened 
our military, weakened our national security, diminished our 
international credibility, and cost the lives of thousands of brave 
American soldiers.

There are certain provisions of the report that I support strongly, 
including a pay raise for military personnel. I am pleased that the 
conference report contains a number of provisions I supported, 
including Senator Webb's amendment creating a Commission on Wartime 
Contracting to examine waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
including the misuse of force by private security contractors, and 
Senator Lautenberg's amendment to create a Special Investigator General 
for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

But on balance, I cannot vote to support a conference report that 
defies the will of so many Wisconsinites--and so many Americans--by 
allowing the President to continue one of the worst foreign policy 
mistakes in the history of our Nation.

I yield the floor.
