Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.

Mr. Speaker, Just Imagine! The mortal sin that we're accused of 
committing on this side of the aisle is believing that we ought to 
provide some additional economic assistance to people


who have been hit the hardest by economic dislocation and have been 
unemployed until their benefits have expired and haven't been able to 
find a job.

It's suggested that we're doing this ''on the backs'' of our fighting 
men and women who return home. I'd suggest it's just the opposite. When 
a man or a woman returns home from Iraq, when we find out that in 
addition to their having their reentry problem, they also, some of 
them, may have post-trauma stress reaction, they find out in addition 
to what they have to worry about for themselves, they also have to 
worry about the fact that their sister or their brother-in-law is now 
unemployed, adding to the burden on that family.
