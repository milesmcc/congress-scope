`Mr. HAGEL â€” 8 February 2007`

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss 
of United States Army National Guard SGT Randy Matheny of Nebraska. 
Sergeant Matheny was killed in Baghdad when an improvised explosive 
device detonated next to the vehicle he was in. He was 20 years old.

Sergeant Matheny was part of a close-knit family in McCook, NE. A 
2004 graduate of McCook High School, Sergeant Matheny is remembered as 
a quiet but likable young man who enjoyed learning about auto 
technology and computers.

Following in the footsteps of two older siblings, he joined the Army 
in March, 2005 as a heavy-vehicle driver. His sister, Karen, is 
currently serving her second tour with the Army National Guard in Iraq. 
His brother, Paul, is a private first class in the regular Army. 
Sergeant Matheny had been serving in Iraq with the 1074th 
Transportation Company since early fall. We're proud of Sergeant 
Matheny's service to our country as well as the service of thousands of 
brave Americans who are currently serving in Iraq.

In addition to his brother and sister, Sergeant Matheny is survived 
by his father Gary Matheny; his mother Jan Collins, and her husband 
Duane Collins; and stepsisters Kori Collins and Laci Ingels.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Sergeant 
Randy Matheny.
