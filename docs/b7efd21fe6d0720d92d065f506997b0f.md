Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in 
strong opposition to this reckless legislation. There is no question 
that I strongly support some of the items in this bill. Unemployed 
Americans desperately need their benefits extended, and I proudly have 
voted to do so every time I have had the chance. This bill also 
contains tax cuts for hard-working American families, tax cuts I voted 
for 2 weeks ago on this very floor.

But this bill holds these good policies hostage to a giant handout to 
those who need help the least. It is political bullying at its very 
worst, an affront to working American families waged by Republicans 
whose irresponsible decisions got us into this mess in the first place.

This bill contains a radical change to the inheritance tax that will 
concentrate wealth and power in even fewer hands than it is now. In a 
country that prides itself on being a meritocracy, not an aristocracy, 
such a giveaway is irrational. It completely neuters our ability to 
invest in people and infrastructure.

This bill contains tax breaks for those who will make more than 
$250,000 a year, breaks that our country can ill-afford when teachers 
are being laid off and libraries are being closed, when those who have 
been unemployed for the longest are losing their safety net, and young 
men and women are still being asked to serve and die in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

The payroll tax cut is another bad idea. Not only does it make Social 
Security less secure, many public servants, including California 
teachers, won't see any tax cut at all.

Overall, this bill adds nearly $1 trillion to the deficit, while 
doing very, very little to create jobs, spur economic growth, or invest 
in America's future.

Because I am committed to creating jobs, making retirement secure, 
and investing in this country, I cannot in good conscience support this 
bill. Compromise is one thing, surrender is another, and I will not 
surrender in my fight to ensure that America remains the land of 
opportunity for all.
