`Mr. LAUTENBERG â€” 19 December 2007`

---


Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, another month has passed, and more 
American troops lost their lives overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. It 
is only right that we take time in the Senate to honor them.

Since last memorializing the names of our fallen troops on November 
16, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 39 troops. They lost their 
lives in Iraq and in Operation Enduring Freedom, which includes

want them to know the country pledges to preserve the memory of our 
lost soldiers, who paid the ultimate price, with the dignity they 
deserve.
