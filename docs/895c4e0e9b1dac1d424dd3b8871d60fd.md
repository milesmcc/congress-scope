`Mr. WALZ of Minnesota â€” 13 March 2007`

Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, it is a fundamental part of human 
nature that people will do high-quality work when somebody is keeping 
an eye on their performance. Businesses need accountants, schools need 
principals and school boards. Appropriate management and a vigilant 
watchdog can prevent serious problems and keep things running 
effectively and efficiently.

Well, for 6 years our Federal Government has gone without 
congressional oversight. This administration has had free rein to do 
what it pleased, no matter what the consequences. The results simply 
speak for themselves, Walter Reed, Hurricane Katrina, Iraq.

This is all beginning to change. Under Democratic control, the 
Congress has finally once again assumed its oversight responsibility. 
Already, in just 3 months we have had 91 full committee hearings, with 
73 more planned. In addition, this week the House will consider a 
series of measures to ensure the Federal Government is open and 
accountable to the people of America.

Mr. Speaker, this congressional oversight is exactly what the people 
of southern Minnesota asked for, transparent and accountable government 
for the people. As I campaigned across the First District, I promised 
to do everything with my colleagues to make this happen, and this week 
it continues on.
