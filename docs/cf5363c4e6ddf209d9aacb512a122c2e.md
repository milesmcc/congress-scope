Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have about 26 hours left to complete 
the Transportation and Housing Subcommittee appropriations bill. Our 
majority leader has already said we are going to return to a debate on 
Iraq next week, a very few days away from now.

I have a great deal of respect for General Petraeus, but I would 
remind my colleagues this is the Transportation appropriations bill 
which we are attempting to complete and the amendment before us has 
nothing to do with that subject matter. Therefore, in accordance with 
the point of order established by Senator Lott when he was majority 
leader, I now make a point of order against the amendment, that it is a 
sense-of-the-Senate amendment which is not germane to the 
Transportation appropriations bill.
