# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010

Mr. KAGEN. I rise in support of this amendment and ask a question: 
Whose side are these gentlemen on? The leader of Iran was there with 
the leader of Afghanistan 1 day after our Secretary of Defense, 
Secretary Gates, was there. Are these our friends? Are these the people 
you are willing to invest $35 billion in?

Two thousand three hundred years of human history have proven one 
thing in Afghanistan: It's easy to get into Afghanistan, and very hard 
to get out. When you leave, they will shoot you in the rear end.

Forty percent of all money we are investing in Afghanistan is being 
stolen. One hundred al Qaeda were there before we had the surge. This 
is our time to leave Afghanistan, with all honor and respect. We will 
always support our troops, but not a losing policy.
