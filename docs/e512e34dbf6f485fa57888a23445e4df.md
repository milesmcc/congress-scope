Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the Brain Injury Alliance of South Carolina and to thank them for their 
service in raising public awareness of brain injuries. Leaders of this 
cause have been my longtime friends Lyman and JoAnne Whitehead of Irmo.

An estimated 1.4 million Americans sustain a brain injury yearly. In 
particular, many of our brave men and women serving in the central 
front of Iraq and Afghanistan have experienced some form of traumatic 
brain injury. It is vital that we do all that we can to address our 
veterans just as we address the needs of civilians living with this 
condition.

The Brain Injury Alliance is helping to lead the way in informing the 
public of the dangers of this complex injury and what can be done to 
help individuals rehabilitate. Their public awareness campaign uses 
different forms of media and community outreach to ensure that citizens 
are well educated on this issue. Thousands of individuals and their 
families will surely benefit from this thoughtful assistance.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
