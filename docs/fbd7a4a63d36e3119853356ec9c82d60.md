Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captain Jeremy 
D. Anzevino as a recipient of a Bronze Star Medal for heroic 
achievement during combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. The Bronze Star is the fourth highest award that the 
Department of Defense gives for bravery. heroism, and meritorious 
service.

Captain Anzevino earned the Bronze Star while he was commander of Co. 
L, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division of the II 
Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq. He was team chief and staff 
maneuver advisor for the Military Transition Team. 1st Battalion. 3rd 
Brigade, 1st Iraqi Army Division, from January to July 2007.

His award citation states, ''Anzevino provided advice and assistance 
to Iraqi leaders of 1st Battalion during counterinsurgency operations, 
which led to the elimination of numerous insurgents.''

Captain Anzevino's bravery goes above and beyond what we are asked of 
as citizens of this country. His heroism illustrates the compassion of 
Iowans; willing to risk their own lives for their country. For this I 
offer him my utmost respect, congratulations, and thanks.

I commend Captain Jeremy Anzevino's courageousness and service to our 
great nation. I am honored to represent Captain Anzevino in the United 
States Congress and I wish him the best in his future service to our 
country.
