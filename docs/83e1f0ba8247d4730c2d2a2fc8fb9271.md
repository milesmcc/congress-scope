Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is an historic day. This is a 
wonderful day for the people of the District of Columbia.

I first came to Washington, Mr. Speaker, in May of 1961 to go on 
something called the Freedom Rides. It was impossible for blacks and 
whites to board a Greyhound bus or Trailways bus here in the District 
of Columbia, and travel together through Virginia, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, into Mississippi and to New Orleans.

I came back here in 1963 at the age of 23 with Eleanor Holmes Norton, 
the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, to participate in the 
March on Washington. To be here and see Jack Kemp, an old friend, 
former colleague, on this day is a great day.

So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1906. And I want to make it 
plain and crystal clear that no one, but no one, will pay more taxes 
under this bill. It changes in a very minor way estimated tax payments 
made by wealthy individuals. This bill does not increase their taxes. 
It would affect only 4,000 multimillionaires. It is only a tiny change.

Yes, I am going to say it again: I am pleased to have supported H.R. 
1905. Today is the day for Washington, D.C. residents to realize the 
dream that so many take for granted. The 200-year wait is over. The 
200-year wait is over.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to vote ''yes'' for H.R. 1906.

Mr. Speaker, I submit the following for the Record:
