`Mr. SALAZAR â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, through the Chair to my good friend from 
Oklahoma, I enjoy our work together on many multiple fronts, but with 
respect to former Senator Cleland, I did see the pain from the attacks 
that were made against him in Georgia. With respect to what you refer 
to, my friend from Oklahoma, concerning, quote, ''the surrender 
resolution,'' in my view, from what I have heard from my colleagues 
here as we have entered this debate, it appears what we are talking 
about is a way for an orderly disengagement from Iraq.
