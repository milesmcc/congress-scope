Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. The war in Iraq is a disaster and it's time to bring 
our brave troops, the men and women who volunteered to serve their 
country for the right reasons but were sent to Iraq for the wrong 
reasons. It is time now for them to come home.

For that reason, I support this bill which, for the first time, ties 
funding to the responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq, 
beginning within 30 days of passage and to end in December 2008.

I'm supporting this bill for another important reason. It establishes 
once and for all that the United States of America does not torture 
people. This bill is not confused about waterboarding. Waterboarding is 
clearly made illegal, as well as electric shocks and mock executions 
and every other gruesome interrogation method that is currently 
prohibited in the Army Field Manual.

The American people elected the Democratic majority in this House 
last November because they're done with the war. They're sick and tired 
of losing American lives in Iraq. And they're sick and tired of losing 
vital programs at home to continue to finance this tragic war.

This is a vote of conscience. I urge every one of my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this bill.
