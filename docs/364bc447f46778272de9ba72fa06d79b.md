Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Virginia, he used some words 
which I think tell part of the story here when he said his amendment 
with Senator Lugar is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. He is a veteran 
lawmaker and knows a sense-of-the-Senate resolution does not have the 
power of law. It is to suggest policy changes to the administration. 
The difference with Levin-Reed, if I am not mistaken, is we are dealing 
with legislative language. We are actually changing the law of the land 
when it comes to our forces in Iraq. That is significantly different. 
This is self-enforcing, the Levin-Reed amendment. Sense-of-the-Senate 
resolutions, either by Senator Lugar or Senator Cornyn notwithstanding, 
will not change the policy. They do not have the binding impact of law 
as the Levin-Reed amendment does.
