Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, when will it end with 
Blackwater? Probably not soon enough. Just yesterday, the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform released findings that show that 
Blackwater has potentially misclassified hundreds of workers in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, evading taxes and costing the taxpayers in the United 
States at least $30 million. This comes a few weeks after the same 
committee discovered that Blackwater is raking in potentially $100 
million in profit off of their government contracts. We have got to get 
this situation under control.

That is why I, along with Mr. Welch and Chairman Waxman, have 
introduced legislation to require that private government contractors 
receiving more than 80 percent of their revenue from Federal contracts, 
like Blackwater, must disclose the salaries of their most highly 
compensated employees.

It just isn't right for executives at Blackwater or anywhere else to 
make their fortune off of war profiteering. It is our money, and we 
deserve to know how it is being used.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense 
legislation.
