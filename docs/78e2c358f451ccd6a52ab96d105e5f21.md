Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate 
convenes on Monday, February 26, the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of H. Con. Res. 63, the House Iraq resolution; that there 
be 12 hours of debate; that the debate be divided equally between the 
two leaders; that no amendments or motions be in order; and that the 
Senate vote on passage of the concurrent resolution at the conclusion 
of that time.
