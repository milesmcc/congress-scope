Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, at 3:16 in the afternoon, the 
Senate voted to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2633, 
which is a bill to provide for the safe redeployment of U.S. troops 
from Iraq.

After the cloture vote, I made a proposal that we would have 
postcloture debate for a period of time, a significant period of time, 
agree to the motion, and then go to the bill. But once we completed 
action on this, S. 2633, we would have a cloture vote on the motion to 
proceed to the next matter that I talked about earlier today. That 
consent was rejected.

I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be yielded back, 
and the motion to proceed be agreed to; that upon disposition of S. 
2633, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the 
motion to proceed to S. 2634; further, that if cloture is invoked, 
notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate then proceed to vote on the 
motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3221, the 
housing bill.
