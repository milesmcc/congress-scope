Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume 
in closing.

Mr. Chairman, much was said by the gentleman who spoke before about 
the earmarks once again. Well, he will have an opportunity, and so will 
all of us. There is an amendment by Mr. Campbell pending striking all 
the earmarks from the bill. I certainly will be voting against that 
amendment, but I will be watching with much anticipation how folks on 
that side vote on that amendment, because that will get rid of every 
single earmark from the bill.

Secondly, it is a devastating cut. All of these are devastating cuts. 
Whether we like it or not, we will continue to remind you that the 
great amount of money that has been squandered here was the major tax 
cut that went to the wealthiest, the richest people in this country, 
and that you continue to support, and, secondly, the fact that you will 
not join us in getting out of Iraq so we can save that money that we 
are spending over there. That is a fact.

To bring that fight home on this bill, which came in below the 
President's request, is really a totally improper way to attack it.

Mr. Chairman, I hope every Member votes against this amendment.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
