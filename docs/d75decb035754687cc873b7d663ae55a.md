Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York for 
offering this amendment, as I believe it will help to improve the bill. 
As we all know, and we have seen and we heard that veteran 
entrepreneurship is on the rise, meaning that these services are in 
greater and greater demand.

The existing Veterans Business Outreach Centers have seen a 61 
percent increase in veterans' requests for their services. Women's 
Business Centers report a 103 percent increase in veterans' requests. 
Clearly there is a hunger out there for these type of initiatives. And 
as more of our men and women return from Iraq and Afghanistan, the need 
for veterans' entrepreneurial development programs can be expected to 
grow.

By increasing the resources that are available for our former 
servicemen and -women, this amendment will help many of them launch 
their own businesses.

I will now yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves) for any 
comments that he wishes to make.
