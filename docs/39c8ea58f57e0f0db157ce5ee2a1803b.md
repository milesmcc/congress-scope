`Mr. KERRY â€” 26 July 2007`

---


Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, obstruction for obstruction's sake is not 
in the best traditions of this great institution. It is the worst kind 
of cynical political calculation. I think all of us on our side would 
join in voting to protect the right of the minority to be able to 
filibuster. We all understand that what goes around comes around, and 
the time may come when we again may be in the minority. We Democrats 
don't want to use the nuclear option. We are


not even talking about it. We want to pass bills. We want to pass bills 
that are supported by a majority of people in the Senate, including 
Republicans, and certainly supported by the majority of Americans.

I say to my Republican colleagues that there is a better way to do 
business. We can work together and actually do something positive for 
the American people. All of us know this is a uniquely challenging 
moment for this country. We face new threats and hurdles no generation 
has faced before. We ought to be working together to solve those 
problems. The only chance this Senate has to make a real contribution 
to history is to make a bipartisan contribution. That is the only way 
the Senate meets its own expectations.

Some of the great legislative accomplishments in recent memory came 
under mixed Government, when both sides of the aisle came together.

In 1981, Ronald Reagan saw that Social Security was in danger of 
going bankrupt and placed a call to the Democratic speaker of the 
House, Tip O'Neill. They realized that at the end of the day, nobody 
would solve it if they didn't. So they got together and took the 
politics out of a tough and unpopular vote. The deal they struck kept 
Social Security afloat. Neither man could have done it without the 
other. Neither party could have done it without the other.

We all know the limits of a politics of division, of partisan 
sectarianism. A politics of division can rush our country into war, but 
it cannot sustain our trust or the war itself. A politics of division 
has no answer for 12 million undocumented workers in our houses, 
fields, and factories. It has no answer for 45 million Americans with 
no health insurance, no answer for icecaps that are melting or a failed 
policy in Iraq. The politics of division is bad for America--from the 
Parkinson's patient to the undocumented immigrant to the soldier in 
Iraq. Nobody is benefiting from Republican obstructionism.

It is also bad for the Senate. This Senate has been known as the 
greatest deliberative body in the world. But there is nothing 
deliberative about partisan sabotage. There is nothing deliberative 
about blind obstructionism.

The ongoing debate we have here is about much more than Senate 
procedure. At its core is a debate, really, about where we are headed 
in our relationship with each other, Republicans and Democrats. All of 
us go home and hear from our constituents about how they have lost 
faith in Washington. All of us want to do right by the people who 
elected us and try to make life better for the American people.

Any Senator who has been here for a period of time has watched the 
decline of the quality of the exchange on both sides of the aisle in 
this institution. I have seen colleagues stand up against it. I 
remember when Senator Gordon Smith, in the middle a painful debate on 
Iraq, said:




 My soul cries out for something more dignified.


I think a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle are concerned 
for the Senate. Voters want a debate over ideas, not a war of words; a 
choice of direction, not a clash of cloture votes. The stalemate we 
have now is not what the Senate is renowned for. This is called, as I 
said, the greatest deliberative body in the world, a place where people 
on both sides can find common ground and get good things done for other 
people.

Ultimately, we are accountable to the American people--accountable 
for false promises, accountable for failure to address issues we 
promised to address, whether it is energy independence or military 
families who lose their benefits. We are accountable.

Mr. President, a filibuster to stop all progress, then claim 
Democrats aren't doing anything, is a failed strategy. It is a failure 
because it doesn't put the American people first. I believe the 
American people will hold a party of obstruction accountable. I hope 
that will change.

I yield the floor.
