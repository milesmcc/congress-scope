`Mr. DREIER â€” 14 November 2007`

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.

I will say to my colleagues that it's very interesting to listen to 
this debate, because as we've proceeded, I have yet to hear the word 
''victory'' come from the other side of the aisle at all. I have yet to 
hear anyone interested in trying to build a democracy.

Now, we saw three elections take place in Iraq, as we all know, with 
a 70 percent voter turnout.

We know that there are problems there. My friend from Worcester 
correctly said that we have problems with corruption in government in 
Iraq. We've had corruption problems in this country as well. But the 
fact of the matter is we have seen dramatic improvement. There is no 
doubt about the fact that we've seen improvement.

And I've got to say, Mr. Speaker, that we continue to hear this term 
''redeployment.'' That means one thing. It doesn't mean victory. It 
doesn't mean build a democracy. It means withdraw and lose. And I will 
tell you, Mr. Speaker, we are determined to ensure that that doesn't 
happen.

I reserve the balance of my time.
