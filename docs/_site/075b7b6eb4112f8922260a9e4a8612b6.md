`Mr. DOGGETT â€” 11 January 2007`

Mr. DOGGETT. President Bush has been wrong at every step along the 
descent into chaos in Iraq, and he is wrong once again. The terrible 
price for his repeated miscalculations is paid for by the blood of the 
brave, by hundreds of billions of dollars squandered and by greater 
insecurity for our families. He has no new plan, just an old delusion. 
This isn't a surge. It is a costly, long-term escalation that only 
endangers more young Americans.

Apparently the only troops he will bring home are the many generals 
who disagree with him. He has rejected the advice of the Iraq Study 
Group. He has rejected military counsel. He has rejected the voices of 
the people and their elected representatives. And we must firmly reject 
his escalation of what can only be called a spend-and-bleed policy.
