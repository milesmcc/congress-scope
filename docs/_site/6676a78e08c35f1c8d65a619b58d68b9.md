Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, in December of 2005, I was 
walking to work and was at 1st and C Street when the front page of the 
New York Times revealed the existence of a program that had not been 
previously briefed to the entire Intelligence Committee and to the 
subcommittee that I, at that time, chaired that oversaw the activities 
of the National Security Agency. That launched a period of extensive 
oversight and draft legislation in 2006.

In January of 2007, because legislation didn't pass, the 
administration made an attempt to put this entire program under a FISA 
law that was not designed and was not updated. I described that at the 
time as trying to put a twin-size sheet on a king-size bed. It didn't 
work.

By late summer of 2007, we had lost close to two-thirds of our 
intelligence collection on terrorism. We were unable to respond fast 
enough when we had problems, particularly in war zones.

Just before Memorial Day in 2007, we had three soldiers who were 
kidnapped in Iraq. We needed an Army of lawyers in Washington D.C. to 
listen to the communications of the people that we thought had 
kidnapped them.

That delay is not good enough and led to the insistence that we pass 
the Protect America Act, which this Congress did, over the objections 
of the Democratic leadership, in August of 2007. The Protect America 
Act closed an important intelligence gap, but it expired in February of 
this year, and the gap is at risk of ever widening.

The bill that we pass today will protect the civil liberties of 
Americans and continue to require individualized warrants for anyone in 
the United States or American citizens anywhere in the world. It will 
also allow our intelligence agencies to very rapidly follow up on tips 
and listen to foreigners in foreign countries who are trying to kill 
Americans.

We have restored FISA to its original intent and modernized it for 
21st century communications and technology. This is an important step 
for our intelligence community and will put it on a sound footing for 
the next several decades.

Intelligence, good intelligence, is the first line of defense against 
terrorism, and today this body will take the next step in making sure 
we have the tools to be able to listen to our enemies and prevent other 
terrorist attacks.

I would urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
