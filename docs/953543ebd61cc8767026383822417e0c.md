Mr. LATHAM. I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for the time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my sympathy to the families who lost 
their boys in the tornado in Little Sioux, Iowa, earlier this month.

As a parent, I know that no words uttered on this floor will ease the 
pain of losing a child. I only hope today's statements will serve as a 
timeless reminder that America's heart broke upon the news of this 
tragic loss. As a Nation, we are all so very sorry for your loss.

I'd like to take a moment to talk about Aaron Eilerts of Eagle Grove, 
Iowa. Aaron was 14 years old. He was the only son of Bob and Carol 
Eilerts. He was a dedicated member of Boy Scout Troop 108.

Although I didn't have the honor of knowing Aaron, many people in the 
town of Eagle Grove were touched deeply by this outstanding young man. 
After reading the many tributes to Aaron Eilerts, I was struck by what 
a special person he was.

Aaron had taken it upon himself to make pillowcases for children who 
were sick and confined in hospitals. He made dozens of colorful 
pillowcases, including one for his cousin who was recovering from 
losing his leg serving our country in Iraq.

Aaron will be remembered for his generosity and his big heart. He 
enjoyed making people happy and had a special gift for making folks 
smile.

It should be noted that Aaron was a distinguished member of 
Scouting's National Honor Society, The Order of the Arrow. Aaron was 
elected to the Order by his peers because he best exemplified the Scout 
Oath and Law in his daily life.

I will recite the Scout Oath and Law in Aaron's memory, and I hope it 
will give people a sense of what kind of a person he was and what we 
should all aspire to be.

The Scout Oath reads: ''On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty 
to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people 
at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and 
morally straight.''

The Scout Law requires each Boy Scout to be trustworthy, loyal, 
helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, 
clean, and reverent.

We should all follow Aaron Eilerts' example. He lived a good life, 
doing good things for people in need.
