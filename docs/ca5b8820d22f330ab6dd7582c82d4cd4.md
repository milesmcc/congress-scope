Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I now recognize my colleague from New 
Hampshire to read the names from California.

Before he does that, for those who have just joined us, last year we 
started reading the names of each of our fellow citizens who gave their 
lives in both Iraq and Afghanistan. We read up to 2,400 names. We have 
another 1,000 to go, which today we are reading those names into the 
Congressional Record in recognition of their service so they always 
stay with us in our memory.

My colleague from New Hampshire, Congressman Hodes.
