Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember U.S. 
Marine Cpl. Joe Wrightsman for his selfless and valiant service to our 
nation.

On July 18, 2010, our country lost a Marine, and Jackson Parish lost 
a native son. However, as long as the American flag continues to fly 
over the sands of Afghanistan and the piney hills of Jackson Parish, 
Wrightsman's contributions to protecting the freedoms we hold so dear 
will never be forgotten.

A 2005 graduate of Jonesboro Hodge High School, Wrightsman was 
serving his third tour overseas--an exemplary achievement of a young 
man of 23 years old. In a generation where so many men and women have 
answered freedom's call to duty, his example of heroism and devotion 
embody what has truly made America a great nation for over two 
centuries.

Today, our words seem futile in comparison to Wrightman's service, 
but as written in 2 Corinthians 1:3, our prayer is ''that the God of 
all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulations, may be able to 
comfort those in troubling times.''

I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to U.S. Marine Cpl. 
Joe Wrightsman and extending thanks on behalf of a grateful nation.
