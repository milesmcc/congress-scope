Mr. DURBIN. So it does not seem to be in the best interest of other 
Islamic states to see the development of a Shia force that combines 
Iraq and Iran. So my feeling is, again either through the United 
Nations, through NATO, through other groups, but trying to make this a 
much more inclusive effort, that we have a much better chance.

The problem is clear: As long as it is the United States dominating 
the agenda in Iraq, it is an obstacle for other countries to get 
involved. I salute the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State 
for their efforts, but I think we have complicated the situation 
dramatically with the length of this war and the visibility of the 
United States as the lead force in this invasion.
