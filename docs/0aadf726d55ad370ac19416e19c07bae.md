Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I would like to request the 
House's attention today to recognize the life of a heroic American 
citizen, Major Kevin M. Jenrette.

Major Jenrette, of Lula, Georgia, died in Afghanistan on June 4, 
2009, of injuries sustained when an IED detonated near his military 
vehicle followed by small arms fire. He is survived by his wife and 
children in Lula and his parents in Auburn, Alabama.

Like all those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in this conflict, 
words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family, and 
the gratitude our country feels for his service. Major Jenrette died 
serving the United States and the entire cause of liberty, on a mission 
to bring stability to a troubled region and liberty to a formerly 
oppressed people. He was a true patriot indeed.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the House's 
remembrance on this mournful day.
