`Mr. REED â€” 26 September 2007`

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise at this moment to speak in strong 
support for the renewal of the Children's Health Insurance Program. It 
is an issue that is fast upon us. The House of Representatives passed 
this legislation last evening. We will, I hope, do the same, and will 
send it to the President.

This is an issue that is not just an economic issue; it is also a 
moral imperative. If we cannot ensure the children of this country have 
the opportunity to have access to good health care, then we cannot 
ensure that we keep pace with the basic notion of this country: 
opportunity for all of our citizens.

Health care and education together are the engine that moves this 
country forward. They give children a chance to use their talents, 
develop their talents, and go on and contribute to this great country. 
But also it makes tremendous economic sense. As we invest in children's 
health care, we hopefully will ensure that throughout their lifetime 
they will not only have healthy lifestyles, but they will have the 
advantage of a good start, so that their efforts can be directed toward 
contributing toward their community, and contributing to this economy.

We understand that the costs of health care are skyrocketing, and 
that for many families they have, unfortunately, had to make the choice 
of forgoing it, to leave their children vulnerable, without access to 
good primary care, without access to specialized care when they need 
it.

We also understand that these children, when they get sick, 
ultimately find their way to an emergency room and we end up paying 
much more, because a child who can be seen on a regular basis could 
have access to preventive care. Arriving at the emergency room with a 
very serious condition requires a great deal more resources than seeing 
a child before that condition becomes serious, and becomes an 
emergency.

So we should be, I think, smart, as well as morally responsive to the 
issue before us. And that directs me to my strong support for this 
legislation. The final bill which will be coming before us will invest 
$35 billion in our Nation's children and their future. It preserves 
coverage for 6.6 million children, but it will also reduce the number 
of uninsured children by 4 million.

In fact, the final bill improves upon the Senate bill that I proudly 
supported weeks ago. It provides quality dental coverage to all 
children enrolled. That is critical. I can recall listening to a foster 
mother in Rhode Island. She had six different foster children. What was 
her biggest complaint? She could not get a dentist. They would not see 
her because she did not have dental coverage. Her complaint to me was a 
repetition of what her child said to her in so many words, which was: 
What do I do? How do I take care of a toothache? How do I go to school 
when I cannot bear to concentrate because of the pain?

For most of us here in this room, that would be a simple call to the 
dentist, a trip there, and immediate relief, and for our children also. 
But for millions of Americans, that is not the case. Here we have a 
chance to give them what we too often take for granted.

I think it is going to be an important step forward. I am 
particularly proud, because the architect of this program 10 years ago 
was Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island. He stood on a bipartisan 
basis with many in this Chamber and pushed for the adoption of the 
children's health care bill. It stands as a legacy to him. It is a 
vibrant legacy which we in Rhode Island cherish and we hope we can 
extend through this legislation.

The final bill that will result we hope in passage and signature by 
the President will give Rhode Island an increase in Federal funding 
from $18 million to $93 million. It will prevent future shortfalls. 
Last November on the floor of the Senate before we went out, I insisted 
that we could not leave until we provided help to States that had 
already run out of their SCHIP funding. We were able to do that.

But those stopgap measures at the eleventh hour do not provide for 
the kind of planning and predictability that are essential to keep the 
costs down and keep the program going. I do think, again, this is a 
bill that is worth all of our efforts and all of our support.

If we can afford to spend $12 billion a month in Iraq, we must be 
able to afford to spend a fraction of that to give children health care 
in this country. I just left the Appropriations Committee hearing. 
Secretary Gates is urging $50 billion more funding for Iraq. That is 
quite a bit more than we are asking over 5 years for the children's 
health care program. That is just for several months in Iraq.

The American people, I believe, will demand that we pass this 
legislation. If we can find the resources overseas, we have got to be 
able to find the resources here for this compelling issue.

The other aspect of this is this legislation is fully paid for, 
unlike the spending in Iraq which is deficit spending, which we are 
literally sending forward to the next generation of Americans to deal 
with. This is fully paid for by an increase in the cigarette tax; sound 
fiscal policy as well as sound public policy.

Now, we have heard a lot from the President, particularly about why 
he is proposing to veto this legislation. I find it hard to discover 
any logic at all. It is full of misrepresentations, frankly. The bill 
does not cover children up to 400 percent of poverty. In fact, about 80 
percent of the newly insured children are from families below 200 
percent of poverty. Those are the new children to be enrolled.

This bill is well targeted, and provides incentives to ensure that 
the lowest-income children are insured first. This does not federalize 
health care or socialize it. In fact, in Rhode Island this children's 
health care program is run by private health insurance companies, and 
that is a very effective and efficient approach.

What I have noticed over the last few years is not that private 
health insurance has expanded dramatically in this country and this 
legislation would constrain that. Quite the opposite. With private 
health insurance, the number of insured Americans has decreased. They 
are losing their private insurance. It is too expensive. So the idea 
that this somehow is going to throttle the attempts of the private 
insurance industry to insure those children is, on its face, 
preposterous.

Those children will not be insured because their parents cannot 
afford to pay the coverage, and because private insurance companies 
operate at a profit, they do not extend coverage because they feel like 
it.

This is the way to expand coverage. This is the way to protect 
children. This is the way to invest in our future. This is the way to 
do it in a fiscally responsive manner by increasing the cigarette tax. 
It makes sense on every ground.

The President's suggestion that he is vetoing it has to be something 
other than common sense. In fact, it strikes me as slightly spiteful. 
This is something on a bipartisan basis we have done for 10 years; 
something on a bipartisan basis that we will continue to do. And to be 
frustrated by a Presidential veto, I think, would add insult to the 
injury of not having children insured in this country.

I call on the President to reconsider his veto threat. I call on the 
President to join us in providing health insurance to the children of 
America, to provide them a foundation for their education, provide them 
the foundation to proceed forward as good citizens, good workers in the 
economy, and contributing members. I hope that will happen in the next 
few days with passage and signature by the President.

I yield the floor.
