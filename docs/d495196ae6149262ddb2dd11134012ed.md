Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the service of Ravdan Bold, Ambassador of Mongolia to the United 
States. Ambassador Bold is retiring as Mongolia's emissary to the 
United States, and I want to thank him for his service on behalf of the 
Mongolian people.

As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and co-chair of 
the Mongolia Caucus, I've had the pleasure of getting to know 
Ambassador Bold over the past few years. During his tenure, America 
celebrated the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our 
countries. He is an honest and capable public servant whose work here 
in Washington has been vital to the growth of democracy in Mongolia.

Mongolia remains a strong and strategic partner of the United States. 
Mongolian troops proudly serve in Liberia, Afghanistan, Kosovo and 
Iraq. I'm particularly grateful for Mongolia's continued support of our 
efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan as the central front in the larger 
global war on terrorism, and I look forward to working with the future 
ambassador to strengthen this partnership.

I wish Ambassador Bold; his wife, Oyuum; his two daughters, 
Buyandelger and Buyanjargal, all the best in the years to come.

In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
