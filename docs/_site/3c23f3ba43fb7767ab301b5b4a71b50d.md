`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 23 January 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. I think it is very important, Mr. Ryan, to 
really talk about many of the issues that are facing the right here, 
right now Congress, right here, right now. Not, well, what we would 
like to do pie-in-the-sky. Something realistic.



Mr. Murphy, I can tell you that it is very important that when we 
look at the issue of Iraq, that we have a real discussion. The 
President is going in the opposite direction of the American people at 
this point. I mean, in November, that is what happened. The President 
is moving in this direction, the American people are going in the 
opposite direction. He could be going this way, they are going that 
way. I mean, it is just that simple.

I don't know who the advisers are in the White House or what have 
you, but when you have generals that have been in the field at the 
double digit numbers saying that we are headed in the wrong direction 
as it relates to the strategy that the administration has, you have 
Colin Powell. Goodness gracious, the Secretary of State, the former I 
guess two Joint Chiefs of Staff, the head of the military, to say an 
escalation in troops in a civil war is a wrong thing to do.

We have been saying in November and even now saying that the 
principal mission of our forces should be training of the Iraqi troops. 
Now, that is ''we are going to start training.''

Well, we have been saying that from the beginning. That is a strategy 
to redeploy hopefully one day. Not ''we will work it out sometime in 
the near future.'' The issue of the logistics and force protection and 
counterterrorism activities, those are the things that we should be 
involved in versus patrolling the streets of Baghdad. Patrolling the 
streets of Mosul. That should be the Iraqi force's responsibility right 
now.

The beginning of phase, to be able to redeploy our troops, that has 
to happen. We have military bases, Mr. Ryan, we have been there. We 
have military bases that are the size of some U.S. cities in Iraq where 
troops can be trained, Iraqi troops can be trained, along with getting 
some of our allies to take part in that.

So for us to have what we talk about so much here on this floor, a 
bipartisan approach towards some of these major, major issues, we are 
going to have to move in that direction.

To try to make tax cuts permanent for the super wealthy, that is the 
opposite direction as it relates to being able to provide some sort of 
relief for the middle-class and small businesses in this country. We 
have already said, Mr. Murphy, that we are going to operate in a pay-
as-you-go atmosphere. What does that mean? Mr. Ryan, you know how over 
the years we have said we want to break this down, Mr. Murphy, so that 
everyone can understand what we are talking about.

That means if you are going to pay for something, if you are going to 
spend money, then you have to show how you are going to pay for it. Not 
just saying a chicken in the pot for everyone. Well, how much does it 
cost? That is not important, because we will just ask our country, we 
will just ask Japan, China, the U.K., the Caribbean, Taiwan, Korea, 
Canada and Germany and OPEC nations to pay that for us and we will just 
owe them. We don't have to pay it any time soon, but we will owe them. 
We will be indebted to countries even to countries that we have been 
with war with in the past.
