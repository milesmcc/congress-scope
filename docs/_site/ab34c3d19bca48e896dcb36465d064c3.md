`Mr. JORDAN of Ohio â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding, and I thank him for his amazing service to our country.

Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. There have 
been many good arguments made as to why this resolution is not in the 
best interest of our military, not in the best interest of our country. 
But I want to focus on one point, and that is just how real and how 
serious the threat of terrorism is, because that is what this struggle 
in Iraq is really about. And I am just going to read the list of 
terrorist attacks against Americans, and we have heard this list 
before, but I think it is important to refocus on this:

In 1979, 66 American hostages were taken in Iran. In 1983, 241 
Marines were killed in Beirut. In 1988, 189 Americans were killed in 
the PanAm bombing. In 1993 in the first World Trade Center bombing, we 
lost six Americans. In 1996, 19 servicemembers were killed in the 
Khobar Towers bombing. In 2000, 17 American sailors lost their lives in 
the USS Cole. And, of course, in 2001, that date we all remember, 9/11, 
2,973 Americans lost their lives in the World Trade Center bombing, in 
the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania.

When you think about the actions of these terrorists and how real and 
dangerous they are, I am reminded of last summer when the Pope made a 
statement in a speech about the radical element, small but radical 
element, within the Islamic faith and the violence associated with that 
element. And the reaction to the Pope's statement about violence among 
this radical, but small, element, the reaction to his statement about 
violence was violence. It was the destruction of churches, the 
destruction of buildings. It was the taking of a life of an innocent 
nun in Italy. That is what we are up against.

This Democratic resolution puts us on a path towards leaving Iraq 
before victory is attained. It puts us on a path that will cut funds to 
our brave men and women already in battle. It puts us on a path that is 
wrong for America. And, most importantly, I think, it puts us on the 
wrong path that will most assuredly embolden the very people who are 
responsible for the terrorist acts I just listed.

If you remember, shortly after 9/11 the President gave a series of 
speeches where he outlined a policy. He said if you are a country that 
harbors terrorists, if you are a country that provides financing to 
terrorists, if you are a country that trains terrorists, if you are a 
country that is producing weapons that are going to harm vast numbers 
of people, if you are doing those things, we are going to put you on 
notice that we are not going to tolerate it.

And if you remember, it was amazing how quickly Moammar Kadafi in 
Libya found the Lord and saw the light and how quickly he was willing 
to say, I am going to work now with the United States. He understood 
that when America says something, we mean it. If we just do what this 
Democratic resolutions puts us on the path to do, I am afraid of the 
message it sends to the Kadafis around the world and what that can mean 
for the future safety of Americans and for our military.

This is a great country. We have been able to overcome whatever 
challenges have presented themselves to us throughout our history. And 
it is important that we have the same resolve as we approach this 
challenge.

I am just a freshman Member of the Congress; and just a few weeks ago 
it was put on display about what is so great about America, as we said, 
in this Chamber during the State of the Union address. And during that 
speech, the President pointed up to the gallery, and he highlighted 
some great Americans, some American heroes. And the one that stuck out 
in my mind, and many of you may remember this, was Wesley Autrey, the 
subway man. And I thought it was so amazing to see what this man had 
done and how that contrasts with the actions of the terrorists. Wesley 
Autrey in the subway, willing to jump in front of a train on the track 
to save a complete stranger simply because he was a fellow human being. 
Contrast that action with the action of the terrorist who will jump 
into that same subway, blow himself up to kill as many innocent people 
as he can.

What is great about this country is the respect we place on human 
life, the preciousness and sacredness that Americans have for human 
life. That is the difference between us and the terrorists. That is why 
it is so important to confront these folks wherever they choose to 
fight us. Right now that place is Iraq. That is why this resolution is 
bad.

Ladies and gentlemen, we should not pass a resolution in which 
politicians second guess our military leaders in the field. We should 
not pass a resolution that will embolden our enemy. And, most 
importantly, we should not waver in our commitment to protect human 
life and to confront the evil that is among us.

I urge a ''no'' vote on the resolution
