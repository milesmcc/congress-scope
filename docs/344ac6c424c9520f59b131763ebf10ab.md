Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Courtney-
Petri-Matsui amendment regarding Troops to Teachers. The amendment 
includes provisions of the bipartisan 9/11 Troops to Teachers 
Enhancement Act, which I worked on with my colleagues and has 170 
cosponsors.

Our amendment would make the program more accessible to those 
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, it is the clear 
intent of this amendment to expand the number of school districts 
eligible to participate in the Troops to Teachers program.

With their proven service, diverse backgrounds, and leadership 
traits, our Nation's veterans can serve their country again by serving 
as teachers in our Nation's most vulnerable schools. Witnessing the 
success of this program in schools in my community has strengthened my 
determination to expand the Troops to Teachers program.

I urge the Members to vote in support of this amendment.
