Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
this legislation, in support of our troops, in support of our veterans, 
and in strong support of ending the Iraq war.

After 4 years of mismanagement, mistakes and excuses, the Bush 
administration and their supporters in Congress continue to be 
comfortable with a ''stay the course'' policy, while American troops 
are in the middle of an Iraq civil war.

Passing this supplemental appropriation requires leadership. It will 
be the Democrats passing this bill, taking the first historic step 
towards ending President Bush's Iraq war.

It will be Democrats who hold President Bush and President Maliki 
accountable for achieving the political conditions that will allow U.S. 
troops to come home safe and soon.

Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Obey, Chairman Murtha all deserve to be 
recognized for their courage and their leadership in bringing this war 
to an end.

And I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and take the first 
important step towards ending the war in Iraq.
