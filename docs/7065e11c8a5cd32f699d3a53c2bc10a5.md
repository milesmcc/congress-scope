Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Department of State and Foreign 
Operations chapter of this supplemental totals $6.17 billion, which is 
the same as the President's request. The bulk of these funds are for 
emergency operations and programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and 
Haiti.

Senator Gregg and I supported most of the President's requests, but 
we could not support them all and there were other items, like pandemic 
flu and assistance for disaster victims and refugees in other parts of 
the world, which we could not ignore.

We also provide additional assistance for Mexico, where drug-related 
violence spilling into the United States is a growing concern of many 
Senators, and for Jordan, a key ally in the Middle East.

We include language requiring a determination by the Secretary of 
State that the governments of Afghanistan and Haiti are taking 
necessary steps concerning transparency and corruption. We require 
consultation with local communities and a central role for women in 
decisions about assistance programs.

The funds in the State and Foreign Operations chapter of this bill 
are for programs that are strongly supported by both the Department of 
State and the Department of Defense, in countries where the United 
States has important national security interests.

I very much appreciate the way Senator Gregg and his staff worked 
with me and my staff on our chapter of this bill. At a time when it is 
popular to complain that Washington is ''broken,'' the Appropriations 
Committee continues to do important and necessary work in its 
traditional, bipartisan manner and I think this bill is an example of 
that.

I want to thank Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran for the 
support they have given us during this process. I would also ask that 
if Members have amendments to the State and Foreign Operations chapter 
that they inform Senator Gregg and me as soon as possible.
