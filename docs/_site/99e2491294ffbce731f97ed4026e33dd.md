Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas. And again, Mr. 
Speaker, if someone would like to pull down the summary and get the 
information on this bill, house.gov/Hensarling, H-E-N-S-A-R-L-I-N-G, /
RSC, and they can pull down our summary here. H.R. 2764 is the omnibus. 
Not a minibus. It is a great big omnibus, all 3,565 pages, and they can 
see for themselves a little bit about what is contained in here and 
what is not contained.

And as the gentleman from Texas said, the fact that we are a Nation 
at war and we have men and women in the field in Iraq who are fighting 
for our freedom, fighting for our ability to be here and to serve in 
the U.S. House of Representatives, fighting for our security so that we 
can safely and peacefully celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, 
and we do not honor their service by funding that work. It is a serious 
error. It is a serious omission.

At this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. Shadegg), who has been chairman of the RSC in times past. He 
serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee. He is one of the leading 
fiscal conservatives in this body, and I yield to him for his comments 
on the omnibus.
