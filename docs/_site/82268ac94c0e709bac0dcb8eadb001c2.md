Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I proudly introduce, along with my 
good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator 
Daniel Inouye, the Native American Veterans Access Act. This measure 
would provide equitable veterans' services to Native Americans by 
allowing tribal governments to apply for veterans' program grants 
currently limited to States, and in some cases, even U.S. Territories.

Native veterans have a long history of honorable and extraordinary 
service in our national defense. From the American Indians who served 
alongside General George Washington, to Nainoa Hoe, a Native Hawaiian 
soldier who was killed on patrol in Iraq while carrying the battle flag 
his father held in Vietnam, native veterans have served bravely and 
honorably.

Unfortunately, too often our Nation's track record in serving native 
veterans does not match their service. Especially in the case of native 
veterans who return to their ancestral homelands, reservation 
communities, or tribal villages, many native veterans are 
geographically and culturally disconnected from the services provided 
by State and Federal veterans' programs.

Part of the problem is that veterans' programs are not always 
designed with native veterans in mind. For example, while the 
Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Labor operate several 
exemplary veterans' grant programs for State governments, most of these 
programs are not open to tribal governments. The bill I am introducing 
today would address this issue, by giving tribal governments access to 
many of these important programs.

First, my bill would provide access to VA's two nursing home grants, 
which help local governments construct veterans' nursing homes and pay 
for nursing home care, adult day care, domiciliary care, and hospital 
care. It is important that tribal governments be included in these 
grants, given the expected rise in the number of older native veterans. 
The U.S. Census projects that while the overall number of older 
veterans will decrease by 10 percent by 2020, during that same period 
the number of older native veterans will increase by 60 percent. This 
expected boom in older native veterans makes it important that we give 
tribal governments the same opportunities we already provide State 
governments to care for their elder veterans.

My bill would also give the Secretary of Labor discretion to include 
tribal governments in Veterans Employment and Training programs and 
grants. Veterans' employment services are much needed among native 
veterans, and in Indian Country. Census data indicates that American 
Indian and Alaska Native veterans are twice as likely as other veterans 
to be unemployed. For those veterans living on-reservation, the labor 
market is shamefully dismal: a recently published report from the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs found on-reservation unemployment to be 49 
percent. That unemployment rate is twice as high as national 
unemployment was during the worst year of the Great Depression. Surely 
it is not too much to ask that tribal governments in these 
circumstances be considered for the veterans' employment programs 
States and U.S. Territories already have access to.

I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these measures, as we 
work towards parity in access and benefits for Native American 
veterans.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be 
printed in the the Record.
