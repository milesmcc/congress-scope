Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
H.R. 1591. This is not an Emergency War Supplemental; it is the 
Partisan Repayment Act. Indeed, this legislation is less about 
supplying the troops than feeding the base.

There is desperate need for a new Iraq policy, and we should be using 
this opportunity to have a serious discussion. It is unseemly, even 
embarrassing, to use pork to buy support for bad policy on a bill as 
important as this one. It makes us look as trifling and greedy as our 
enemies claim. The well-being of our men and women in uniform is in the 
balance, as is the future of the Middle East. If ever there was a time 
to win on the strength of one's ideas, this is it.

I share the concerns of my colleagues regarding the progress of the 
war, and I believe there is value in setting benchmarks. Ours should 
not be an open-ended, unquestioning commitment to the Iraqis. They do 
need to assume more responsibility for their own affairs. It is not the 
job of our troops to referee partisan quarrels, nor is it our job to 
baby-sit the Iraqi government.

It is foolish, however, to make such milestones public. It is even 
more foolish to announce a date for withdrawal. Doing so gives the 
enemy too much information and too many options.

It is also foolish to codify deadlines. Who's to say the Iraqi 
government won't make a good faith effort to accomplish the tasks 
required of them? It would be wise to allow them flexibility, not give 
them a drop-dead date. We ourselves are working under a continuing 
resolution because we could not pass more than two appropriations bills 
last year. Our 5-day workweeks are often 4 days long--who are we to set 
a deadline in statute?

There is a pressing need to formulate a new policy for Iraq. I am 
disappointed the Democrats have yet to allow a serious debate on this, 
the most important issue facing the Congress today. Rather, we have 
wasted time with a non-binding resolution regarding tactics--not even 
strategy. Now we send the Iraqis a laundry list of errands and a pre-
determined result.

Success in Iraq will require a broad based policy shift. The Iraq 
Study Group report includes 79 recommendations covering all facets of 
public policy--military, diplomatic, economic, and social. This report 
should form the basis of a productive discussion. Unfortunately, the 
Democratic leadership has opted for a hodge-podge of sound bites 
masquerading as serious legislation. They have stifled debate rather 
than encouraged it by refusing to allow any amendments.

Mr. Speaker, this is but the first act in the play. Our own 
servicemen and women do need the funding this bill would provide. I am 
confident once we get beyond this charade we will be able to craft 
responsible legislation to give it to them.
