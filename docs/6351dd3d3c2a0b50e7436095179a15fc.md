`Mr. REID â€” 17 September 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning 
business until 3 p.m. today, with the time equally divided between the 
two sides.

At 3 p.m. the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 1585, the 
Department of Defense authorization measure. There will be no rollcall 
votes today, which we announced several weeks ago. The managers, 
though, will be here to deal with the authorization bill at 3 o'clock. 
Members are encouraged to come to the floor and offer and debate 
amendments to this bill.

As we all know, this bill is important, to say the least, and there 
are numerous issues associated with this bill that will require debate. 
Of course, the issue of Iraq is a matter that has been discussed at 
some length. I indicated previously I hope we can work out an agreement 
on how we can proceed as it relates to the Iraq amendments. There are 
more than 300 Iraq amendments on this bill. We need to proceed in some 
orderly and structured manner. I will continue to consult with the 
Republican leader and the two managers on this legislation.
