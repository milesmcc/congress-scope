Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Ike Skelton 
for getting us to this point today, 1,581 days, 53 months, over 4 years 
since this President led this Nation to war in Iraq; 3,600 American 
soldiers killed, 27,000 American soldiers seriously injured, 60,000 to 
100,000 Iraqis killed; $10 billion per month, $500 billion American 
dollars spent on this war.

A civil war is raging in Iraq; there is no credible government in 
Iraq; Iraq is


totally destabilized and Iraq refugees are flooding into neighboring 
countries; there is no coalition of the willing supporting the U.S. in 
this war; and we are well on our way to destabilizing the entire Middle 
East.

President Bush and the chief architect of this war, Vice President 
Dick Cheney, are in denial about the disastrous mess they have created. 
Some of us have known for quite some time this war must end. Barbara 
Lee, Lynn Woolsey and I and several other Members of Congress created 
the Out of Iraq Caucus over 2 years ago. We organized this caucus, but 
we were dismissed as bleeding heart liberals.

It has taken too long to get to this point we are at today. This bill 
will at least demand a strategy to get us out of Iraq and a deadline 
will be set. This has been a long time in coming.

However, Mr. Speaker, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. 
President Bush will apply all kinds of pressure, threaten, mislead, 
spend us blind and continue to pursue this immoral war, unless we 
decide that we are not going to fund this war anymore.

In the words of the people on the street who are organized against 
this war, Mr. President, not another nickel, not another dime, not 
another soldier, not this time.

Vote for this bill. It is a good start. And remember, in the final 
analysis, we have got to defund this war.
