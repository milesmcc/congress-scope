Mr. GALLEGLY. Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank 
Chairman Wexler and Chairman Berman for their kind words in their 
opening statements. I stand here today to rise in strong support of 
House Resolution 997 which reaffirms the support of the House of 
Representatives for NATO enlargement.

The resolution also specifically calls on the United States to take 
the lead in supporting closer integration between Ukraine, Georgia and 
NATO. I would like to commend Representative Wexler, as I mentioned 
earlier, the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, for introducing this 
measure and for being a strong, consistent advocate for strengthening 
our bilateral ties with Ukraine and Georgia.

Both of these allies have demonstrated the military capabilities and 
political reforms required to provide concrete benefits to the 
alliance. In the past several years, Ukrainian forces have participated 
with NATO troops in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and 
Afghanistan. They have also made important contributions to coalition 
forces in Iraq in 2004 and 2005.

Georgia has also shown they are ready to take the next step toward 
NATO membership. Georgia has undertaken a top-to-bottom reform of their


military forces, often working closely with U.S. forces in this effort.

As previously mentioned by Representative Ros-Lehtinen, with over 
2000 troops in Iraq, Georgia today has the third largest troop 
contingent in that country after the U.S. and Britain.

Madam Speaker, both Ukraine and Georgia are ready, willing and able 
to integrate more fully with NATO. Again, I would like to recognize 
Representative Wexler for his hard work on H. Res. 997 on behalf of a 
stronger NATO, and I urge passage of this resolution.
