Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Today the New York Times reports that at least 14 of 
the 17 shootings from the September 16 Blackwater incident in Iraq were 
unjustified and violated deadly force rules.

Even though the FBI concluded that Blackwater, a for-profit 
contractor, used excessive force, there is no guarantee that anyone 
will be punished for these killings.

On Monday, the front page of the New York Times ran a story titled 
''Security Guard Fires From Convoy, Killing Iraqi Driver.'' The shooter 
was an employee of DynCorp, and the victim an Iraqi taxi driver. The 
details of the incident are still unclear, but one thing is certain. 
The problem of trigger-happy contractors isn't confined to one company; 
it applies to all private security contractors.

The longer we wait to fix this problem, the worse the situation is 
going to get for the Iraqis and for our troops. I urge my colleagues to 
cosponsor the Stop Outsourcing Security Act, H.R. 4102, to phase out 
unaccountable private security contractors before they do any more 
damage.
