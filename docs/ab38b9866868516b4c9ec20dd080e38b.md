Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentlelady for yielding this precious time.

Mr. Speaker, I heard our colleagues from Oregon, from Idaho and 
Montana speak about the disasters that are striking their area and the 
need for funding and assistance from this legislation.

As we speak, there is a 22,000-acre segment of the Boundary Waters 
Canoe Area Wilderness in the Superior National Forest in the heart of 
my district on fire; 470 firefighters are out there trying to put the 
blaze out.

We need help every bit as much as do the people in Iraq for water and 
sewer and infrastructure investment. We need that help right here at 
home. If we don't have a strong and vibrant economy at home, we can't 
support our troops overseas. We can't support other countries and their 
needs. We have got to rebuild America. We have got to protect our land 
here at home. And this is only today's fire. We had just a year-and-a-
half ago a huge blaze that ripped through the Boundary Areas Canoe 
Area.

We need this assistance, we need it now, and we need it in this bill.
