`Mr. CANTOR â€” 4 March 2010`

---


Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman.

The gentleman refers to some areas that I hope he and the majority 
would work with the minority on in trying to do exactly as he stated, 
which is to create an environment for small businesses to create jobs. 
As the gentleman just saw in the vote taking place on the floor today, 
there were 35 members of his caucus who voted against the so-called 
jobs bill that was on the floor today, perhaps indicating that the 
gentleman may want to work with us as we have been continuing to 
propose tax cuts for small businesses, not necessarily connected with 
what kind of hires that the businesses should do, and not necessarily 
connected with some type of targeted credit that may or may not fit 
with the business model of any particular small business, but in 
general, I think the gentleman would agree, making it easier for small 
businesses to keep the lights on right now so they can return to a mode 
in which they could increase payroll.



Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman if he could speak to his 
mention of the resolution dealing with the Afghanistan war powers. As 
the gentleman knows, the Republicans view a withdrawal from Afghanistan 
within 30 days as incredibly irresponsible.
