Mr. KIRK. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I want to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for 
their bipartisan work on this, for a good underlying bill, in my view, 
as well.

This amendment will assist in our fight against terrorism across the 
globe, especially in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Currently, the terrorist rewards program run by the State Department 
assists in our hunt for terrorists by promising a cash reward or other 
type of assistance for information leading to the arrest of some of the 
world's most deadly terrorists. The Rewards for Justice Program, 
established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, has now 
paid over $77 million to more than 50 people who have provided credible 
information to put terrorists behind bars and prevent acts of 
terrorism.

As a staff member, I helped write the amendments that President 
Clinton asked for when we wanted to offer rewards for persons indicted 
for war crimes, for example, in the former Yugoslavia. We also passed 
legislation under Chairman Hyde that loosened up this program so that 
we could provide more than cash assistance, more meaningful assistance 
to farmers and other people who may not be able to read in very rural 
parts of Central Asia.

The program has been the key to success in apprehending people, 
including Mir Amal Kansi, a terrorist who murdered two CIA employees 
and injured three others in his 1993 rampage outside of CIA 
headquarters in Virginia. The program was also important in nailing 
Ramzi Yousef, convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Uday 
and Qusay Hussein, the two murderous Hussein brothers; Khadaffy 
Janjalani and Abu Solaiman, two high-ranking members of Abu Sayyaf in 
the Philippines; Libyan Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, convicted on 
January 31, 2001, for the murder of 270 people on Pan Am Flight 103 
over Lockerbie; Hamsiraji Marusi Sali, the leader of the ASG; Muhsin 
Khadr al-Khafaji, a member of Saddam Hussein's top Ba'ath Party 
leadership; Iraqi Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, a former official military 
commander; and Muhammad Zimam Abd al-Razzaq al-Sadun, number 41 on the 
Iraqi ''top 55'' wanted list.

Under current law, though, the United States may not pay an award to 
an officer or employee of another government. I have traveled to 
Pakistan in each of the last 4 years where I have met a number of 
government officials, and at the strong suggestion of the fairly poorly 
paid, especially IB, intelligence bureaus, I believe the Secretary of 
State should be allowed to pay such a reward especially if it has to do 
with nailing the greatest terrorists. If there is anyone anywhere 
working for anyone who has information related to the whereabouts of 
Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahiri, we should be doing everything 
possible to elicit that information.

As Secretary Clinton, Secretary Gates, General Petraeus, and 
Ambassador Holbrooke execute the President's new strategy for 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, we should do everything we can to develop a 
complete picture of where the al Qaeda and Taliban leadership is 
hiding. This amendment provides our key State Department and 
intelligence officials with every possible tool that they could have to 
make sure they can offer a reward even if that person, for example, 
works for the Pakistani IB bureau.

In the last Congress, the House overwhelmingly passed this amendment 
419-1, but it did not pass the Senate, which is why I offer it today.

Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
