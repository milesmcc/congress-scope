Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Very quickly, I know that all of us 
understand you're innocent until proven


guilty. We are very pleased with the leadership that ACORN is taking in 
addressing the needs of those who cannot speak for themselves.

They understand the need for transparency; they understand the need 
for audits; they understand the need for new leadership in many of 
their areas. And they are doing it. And I'm grateful for the fact that 
we have congressional oversight. But I'm not going to demonize an 
organization that helps those that cannot help themselves.

Very quickly, it is important for the President to be addressing the 
question of: What do we do in Afghanistan, counterinsurgency or 
counterterrorism? I believe we should surge up diplomacy, fight the 
terrorists, and gain the friendship of the Afghan people, and let the 
Afghans fight the fight alongside of us--and not send 40,000 troops 
into Afghanistan.
