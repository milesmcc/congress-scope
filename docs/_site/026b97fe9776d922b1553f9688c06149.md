Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose the 2008 Department of Defense 
appropriations conference report because it provides money to continue 
the misguided war in Iraq but fails to require the redeployment of U.S. 
troops. The war in Iraq is the wrong war. It is overstretching our 
military and undermining our national security. It is long past time 
for this war to end.

Some may pretend that this conference report does not include any 
Iraq money. That claim is misleading, at best. This bill provides the 
regular DOD funding that keeps the war going. In fact, this bill will 
pay for a significant part of our operations in Iraq. Moreover, there 
is nothing in this bill to prevent the Defense Department from shifting 
regular funds to pay for the full costs of the war in Iraq in the event 
that the Congress does not enact supplemental appropriations for the 
war.

I strongly support our brave men and women in uniform. We do not do 
them any favors by giving the President money to keep this open-ended 
war going with no strings attached. For their sake, and for the sake of 
our national security, we should use our power of the purse to force 
the President to bring this war to a close. This bill represents 
another missed opportunity, and another example of Congress failing to 
use its power to bring our troops out of Iraq.
