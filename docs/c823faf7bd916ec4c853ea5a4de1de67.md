Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3159 and 
thank Congresswoman Tauscher for her leadership.

We have had a lot of disagreement on the occupation of Iraq. There is 
one thing we all agree upon, however--the support of our troops.

The toll that has been taken on our men and women in uniform is 
unimaginable. They have volunteered to sacrifice so much in service to 
their Nation.

Unfortunately, political decisions by this administration have 
prevented us from bringing this misguided occupation to an end.

Today, we try to fulfill our commitment to the brave troops who are 
out there serving on the front line. The least we can do is to ensure 
that every service member gets the right amount of training and rest. 
It is our moral obligation.

I support H.R. 3159 and look forward to the day when we can bring our 
troops home for good.
