Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
excellent new project to improve the lives of American soldiers who 
were wounded serving our country: the Disabled Sports USA Military Golf 
Program. The Wounded Warrior Project, Disabled Sports USA, America 
Supports You and the PGA of America have created a new program that 
aims to help rehabilitate veterans severely wounded in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. By instructing these wounded warriors how to play golf, 
the PGA and Disabled Sports USA teaches our disabled veterans a 
fulfilling recreation pursuit.

These organizations provide invaluable services to our veterans. 
Wounded Warriors


offer programs nationwide that offer our severely injured soldiers 
opportunities to rebuild their lives.

Disabled Sports USA, established in 1967 by disabled Vietnam veterans 
to serve the war injured, has expanded to provide rehabilitative sports 
programs to anyone with a permanent disability.

America Supports You was launched in November, 2004, by the 
Department of Defense, and built a network of supporters that writes 
letters, sends care packages and helps the wounded when they return 
home.

And the PGA, America's largest working sports organization, comprised 
of 28,000 men and women dedicated to growing, teaching and managing the 
game of golf, has throughout its 91-year history provided instruction 
and equipment to the military and employment opportunities to veterans.

I am proud to recognize these four organizations that are doing so 
much to aid our honored veterans. I hope my fellow members of Congress 
share my passion for the Military Golf Program. The program, and its 
purpose of giving back to those who so nobly served our country, is 
worthy of our praise.
