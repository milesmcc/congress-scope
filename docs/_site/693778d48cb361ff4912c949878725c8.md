Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of SGT Bruce 
Horner, United States Army, and to celebrate his service to our 
country.

Sergeant Horner served in the United States Army for 18 years. His 
dedication and leadership skills made him an invaluable member of the 
127th Military Police Academy out of Fliegerhorst, Germany. He was 
killed on June 1, 2007, in Baghdad, while serving his first tour in 
Iraq. He fulfilled his duty with honor and distinction.

Sergeant Horner had a strong relationship with his church and with 
God. His faith played an important part in his life and guided him. It 
is my sincere hope that the Horner family is strengthened by the strong 
faith that sustained him in life. He leaves behind his wife, Erin, and 
mother and father, who reside in Cleveland, Ohio. Everyone Sergeant 
Horner touched will be forever changed because of his influence.

Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join me in honoring SGT Bruce 
Horner for his service in the defense of the nation. May his dedication 
to country, faith and family serve as a model for us all.
