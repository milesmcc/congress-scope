Mrs. DAVIS of California. I thank my colleague.

Mr. Speaker, on November 6, we passed the Heroes Earnings Assistance 
and Relief Tax Act, and today we reaffirm our commitment to those who 
volunteer to protect the United States by putting forward a final 
product that reflects our commitment to veterans and servicemembers. I 
want to thank the hard work of the House Ways and Means Committee and 
the Senate Finance Committee for the hard act.

My colleagues have highlighted a number of provisions. I wanted to 
just do two. One provision adjusts how the Social Security 
Administration calculates income for SSI eligibility to help military 
families keep their SSI benefits.

I really want to thank a number of my families in my district in San 
Diego who shared their stories with me and gave me this opportunity to 
help make a change in this legislation. And the second I believe has 
already been mentioned, and that removes a date of service requirement, 
preventing those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to fully take 
advantage of the federally supported Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bond 
program. This legislation, I believe, Mr. Speaker, demonstrates our 
Nation's appreciation for our military families and veterans, and I 
encourage my colleagues to vote for it.
