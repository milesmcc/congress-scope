`Mr. POE â€” 22 May 2008`

Mr. POE. ''From this day to the ending of the world, we in it shall 
be remembered. We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for he today 
that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.''

Mr. Speaker, Shakespeare penned this in Henry V. It represents the 
unfailing commitment soldiers have for their fellow comrades.

Since 2004, 26 men and women from the Second Congressional District 
area of Texas have served honorably and given their lives for the cause 
of freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan; 26 times I have come to this House 
floor to talk about one of them.

This Memorial Day I would like to honor them again by name. They 
aren't just a statistic, Mr. Speaker. They are real people who gave 
their life for the American cause. They are the sons and daughters of 
America, and they are our heroes.

In America's first war fighting for freedom, it was said by Patrick 
Henry, ''The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the 
vigilant, the active, and to the brave.'' We are fortunate that those 
words still ring true today and that American troops overseas carry 
those values into battle.



I keep the photos of the fallen in all of my offices here in D.C. and 
in Texas, and the noble few who have died for the rest of us in the 
Second Congressional District of Texas are on this chart, Mr. Speaker. 
They are:

Mr. Speaker, these 26 warriors represent the best of our Nation. They 
are the sons of liberty, the daughters of democracy. These few, these 
noble few, on this chart are American warriors who take care of the 
rest of us.

In the words of George Orwell, ''We sleep safe at night in our beds 
because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those 
who would try to do us harm.'' The American soldier.

And that's just the way it is.
