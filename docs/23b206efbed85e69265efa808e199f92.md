`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 27 September 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a choice. There are those who 
want to continue the ongoing flow of resources to Iraq when we have 
asked our military to do everything they could, and they have done it 
with great valor, and yet still the Iraqi politicians cannot get it 
together. They are holding American service men and women hostage--
hostage. The blood of American servicemen is flowing in Baghdad, and 
this is wrong.

This is an issue of priorities. I believe we ought to invest in the 
children, and I think we have benefited enough here in the Senate from 
our own largess from the Federal taxpayers in terms of supporting 
ourselves that we should be ashamed if we cannot see the responsibility 
we have to look after children of working families in this country.

I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.
