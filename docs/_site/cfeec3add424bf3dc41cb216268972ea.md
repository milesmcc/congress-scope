`Mr. LEAHY â€” 3 December 2007`

---


Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate begins its final work period 
of the year, I wish to thank those members of the Judiciary Committee 
who have been cooperative and who have worked so hard throughout this 
year. Much has been accomplished. But much can still be done. We 
reported and the Senate passed an important privacy measure, the 
Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act, S. 2168, just before 
the Thanksgiving recess. I urge the House to adopt it without delay. In 
addition, the Senate again passed our copyright bill to protect vessel 
hull designs, S. 1640, which I hope will also be adopted by the House.

Months ago we reported and passed an important court security bill, 
S. 378, and Freedom of Information Act reform legislation, S. 849. I 
believe that we have resolved differences raised by the House and 
should be able in the short time remaining to us this year to have the 
Senate reconsider these measures in slightly modified form, pass them 
by unanimous consent, and have the House endorse them, as well.

I would like to see us consider and pass important matters the House 
has passed and sent to us. The Free Flow of Information Act, H.R. 2102, 
is on the Senate calendar. It would provide protection to first 
amendment values by establishing a Federal privilege and procedure for 
considering claims of press protection. For the first time, this year 
the Judiciary Committee reported a similar bill, S. 2035, and we did so 
on a bipartisan basis. We should proceed to enact this legislation into 
law.

Another important matter sent to us from the House that I would hope 
we could enact before adjourning this year is one on which we have 
worked for some time, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, H.R. 3685. 
We also have before us a House-passed version of the Second Chance Act, 
H.R. 1593. While it does not include every provision I would have liked 
to incorporate, we should nonetheless proceed to enact this 
legislation.

I urge the Republican Senator who has a hold on the bill to extend 
temporary judgeships around the country, S. 1327, to remove this hold 
so that we can provide the relief needed in our Federal judiciary in 
Kansas, Ohio, Nebraska, California, and Hawaii. Enacting court security 
legislation will likewise require the relinquishing of a Republican 
hold. Another matter stalled since this summer by a Republican hold has 
been the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, S. 535. I have 
made statements to the Senate about these consensus measures before. I 
hope that with the year rapidly ending, the Republican Senator holding 
up these worthwhile matters will reconsider the opposition and allow 
bills supported by an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of the Senate 
to pass.

A number of other measures reported by the Judiciary Committee have 
been delayed by Republican holds too. If it is not possible to move 
these measures this month, I urge the Senate to take up and pass these 
bills when it begins its second session in January. One such bill is 
the War Profiteering Prevention Act, S. 119, which was reported by 
the committee in April. It would provide a significant new tool for 
Federal law enforcement to combat the scourge of war profiteering, and 
it is needed now more than ever, given the ongoing reports of rampant 
fraud, waste, and abuse in Iraq. Another is the School Safety and Law 
Enforcement Improvements Act, S. 2084, which we developed in response 
to the tragedy at Virginia Tech.


When we return next year, we will have the opportunity to consider 
and enact patent reform legislation, the Leahy-Hatch Patent Reform Act 
of 2007, S. 1145. I hope that we will also make time to consider our 
comprehensive bipartisan data privacy bill, the Leahy-Specter Data 
Privacy and Security Act, S. 495, which we reported in May.

Next spring I hope we can turn to the Deceptive Practices and Voter 
Intimidation Prevention Act, S. 453, which the committee reported this 
fall, and our bipartisan Leahy-Cornyn Public Corruption Prosecution 
Improvements Act, S. 1946, that adds teeth to our ethics reforms.

These are just some of the matters on which the Judiciary Committee 
has been hard at work this year. We could not have accomplished what we 
have without the contributions of our members. I want, in particular, 
to commend our newest members, Senators Cardin and Whitehouse, for 
their exceptional work. They have initiated legislative efforts, 
chaired important hearings, and been full partners in the work of the 
committee.

I would also like to thank and commend Senator Durbin for chairing 
our newest subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, 
and for making it one of the most active and productive subcommittees 
we have. Senator Durbin has originated genocide accountability and 
child soldier accountability legislation, trafficking in persons 
legislation, and war crimes legislation, all in rapid succession. He 
has made the Human Rights Subcommittee into what we hoped it would be, 
a vehicle to focus our attention on fundamental aspects of what makes 
us all Americans. We all owe him a debt of gratitude.

Of course, we would not be nearly as far along in our work without 
the help of our Republican members, led by Senator Specter. We have 
proceeded with significant bipartisan legislation on privacy, press 
shield, patents, FOIA, public corruption, and crime. Currently we are 
working together to improve the FISA legislation about to be considered 
by the Senate by exploring whether we can adopt an amendment that will 
increase accountability through the procedural device of substitution, 
rather than a blanket grant of retroactive immunity for the warrantless 
wiretapping of Americans that took place from 2001 through 2007. 
Senator Specter and I joined to seek to restore the great writ of 
habeas corpus but, despite support by a majority of the Senate, we were 
stymied by a Republican filibuster. Likewise, we have joined to achieve 
majority support for voting rights for the District of Columbia only to 
be blocked this year by another Republican filibuster.

I hope that as we enter these last few weeks of the year, we are 
allowed to


make progress on the matters I have outlined here today and that the 
obstruction that has stalled our further progress will not be 
continued. Let us move forward together in the best interest of the 
American people. Any Senator can prevent action on an item in these 
waning days of the session. There is no secret or magic about that. The 
question for Senators this month is whether they are willing to put 
aside minor differences and partisan agendas to join with us in making 
progress and moving forward.

I yield the floor.
