Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I want to praise one of my colleagues from the 
other side of the aisle, my shipmate in the Navy, Congressman Chris 
Carney.

Chris is a commander in the Navy and just completed 2 weeks of active 
duty. He served as a combat mission operations commander for the 
Predator and Reaper Hunter/Killer UAVs, as well as the Global Hawk.

Commander Carney was the first sailor to be certified as a mission 
commander, now with the call sign of ''Big House.'' Over the past 
couple of weeks, his unit flew dozens of missions over Afghanistan and 
Iraq providing our troops with intel and reconnaissance. They also took 
out Taliban terrorists with Hellfire missiles and helped with the 
search and rescue of Americans.

If you see Commander Congressman Chris Carney back at work today, 
thank him for his service to our Nation in uniform as one of our 
citizen-sailors.
