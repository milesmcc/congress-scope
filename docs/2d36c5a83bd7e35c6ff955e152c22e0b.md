Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, the emergency supplemental 
conference report that will come before this House today does three 
crucial things. One, it supports our military men and women; two, it 
sets benchmarks for the Iraqis to meet; and, three, it makes clear that 
the war will not continue indefinitely.

Unfortunately, after 4 years, thousands of lives lost, and billions 
of dollars spent, the President continues to demand an open-ended 
commitment to our American troops being deployed on the streets of 
Iraq. President Bush says he will veto the emergency supplemental, 
ignoring the views of this Congress, the American people, former 
military generals and the nonpartisan Iraq Study Group.

While he delays signing this bill, the President continues to claim 
that the resources for American troops will begin to run out later this 
month. However, the fact is that the Congressional Research Service 
confirms resources will be available well into the summer.

The New York Times notes this week that the real obstacle to getting 
the money promptly to the troops would be the veto of the President.

The President should support this important legislation which sends a 
message that this war is not going on indefinitely.
