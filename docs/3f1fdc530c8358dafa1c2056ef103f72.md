Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise to address an issue 
of critical concern. As my colleagues know, Sept. 5-12, 2010, has been 
designated as Suicide Prevention Week, and I am honored to do my part 
in raising the awareness of this threat so that we can better protect 
those most vulnerable in every community.

Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death among teens and young 
adults. Every 2 hours, a person under the age of 25 commits suicide, 
resulting in estimated 12 youth suicides every day or more than 4,000 
unnecessary deaths each year.

More than 78,000 veterans of current military operations in Iraq and 
Afghanistan have sought help for mental health related issues. I, along 
with my colleagues, have taken steps to provide the needed support to 
our warriors, but we must do more. More than 6,200 veterans commit 
suicide each year; our best and bravest feel that they have no options 
or way out of their despair.

Among our senior citizen population, the suicide rate is the highest. 
Although those over the age of 65 account for just 12.5 percent of the 
population, they account for nearly 16 percent of all suicides.

There is also an ethnic component to suicide rates. While CDC reports 
that the rate of white, non-Hispanic suicide attempts is 7.7 percent, 
the black non-Hispanic suicide attempt rate is nearly 10 percent and 
the Latino suicide attempt rate is an astonishing 14 percent.

We must do everything in our power to reduce this threat and to 
provide resources to those who need our assistance.

I would like to recognize and thank those people and organizations 
who are dedicated to reducing suicide rates and preserving life. One 
such organization located in the 11th Congressional District of 
Virginia is CrisisLink. CrisisLink is dedicated to reducing the 
frequency of suicide attempts and death and to providing resources that 
can ease the pain for the survivors affected by the suicide of a loved 
one. Through educational programs, research projects, intervention 
services and bereavement services, CrisisLink is at the forefront of 
providing needed support to those who need it the most.

For 40 years, CrisisLink has provided needed services to the 
community; answering more than half a million crisis calls, responding 
to more than 25,000 potential suicides, providing more than a quarter 
million referrals to community resources, promoting mental wellness, 
educating the community about depression and other mental illnesses, 
and reducing the stigma attached to mental illness.

Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in proclaiming 
September 5-12, 2010, as Suicide Prevention Week, and I ask that we 
commend CrisisLink for its unwavering commitment to providing 
assistance to so many in their time of need.
