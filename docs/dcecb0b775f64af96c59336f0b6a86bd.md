Mr. CLEAVER. Thank you, Congressman Ellison.

One of the most significant measures to find its way into the United 
States Congress is legislation put forth by our colleague, Eleanor 
Holmes Norton, who is the delegate for the District of Columbia.

This legislation would allow the citizens of the United States of 
America, who live in the District of Columbia, to finally, to finally, 
after more than 200 years, have the opportunity to cast their vote to 
place a representative in the United States Congress. This is a city of 
almost 600,000 people, and many people around the Nation may be 
surprised to learn that the District of Columbia is the only city in 
the United States that must submit its municipal budget to the United 
States Congress.

That, in and of itself, is an injustice. That means that this city, 
unlike any other city, is subservient to the Congress of the United 
States and they have no voice whatsoever.

The sad thing goes further. Forty percent of the District of Columbia 
own their own homes, and coming from those homes are young men and 
women who have died in the world wars, who have died in Vietnam and who 
are still dying in Iraq and Afghanistan.
