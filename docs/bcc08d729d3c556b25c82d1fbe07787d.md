# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `bcc08d729d3c556b25c82d1fbe07787d`
`Mr. JONES of North Carolina â€” 14 February 2007`

---


Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote a military expert, General John 
Abizaid, former commander of the U.S. Central Command, who said during 
a Senate Armed Services hearing on November 15, 2006, ''I believe that 
more American forces will prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from 
taking more responsibility for their own future.''

General Abizaid is not in favor of this surge. He is a military 
expert.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. 
Castle).
