Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the conference report to accompany H.R. 1591.

As I have said on previous occasions, Congress has every right to 
limit the use of appropriated funds. In this instance, I disagree with 
the manner in which my Democratic colleagues have chosen to do so.

The Iraqi government needs to understand our patience is not 
unlimited. Indeed, establishing benchmarks could well have a useful 
purpose in the effort to have the Iraqis take more decisive steps 
towards autonomy. Making these benchmarks public and tying them to a 
specific date by which we must begin to withdraw our troops, however, 
is a mistake. It sends the wrong message to our troops, and it gives 
the enemy invaluable information.

Along with many of my colleagues, I want our troops to leave Iraq as 
quickly as possible. Setting a public date by which this must happen, 
however, will ultimately create more problems than it solves.
