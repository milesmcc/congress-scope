`Mrs. FEINSTEIN â€” 11 February 2009`

---


Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and 
colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, to re-introduce the Cluster 
Munitions Civilian Protection Act.

The bill is also co-sponsored by Senators Bingaman, Boxer, Brown, 
Cardin, Casey, Durbin, Feingold, Kennedy, Mikulski, Menendez, Merkley, 
Sanders, Stabenow, and Whitehouse.

Our legislation places common sense restrictions on the use of 
cluster bombs. It prevents any funds from being spent to use cluster 
munitions that have a failure rate of more than one percent; and unless 
the rules of engagement specify: the cluster munitions will only be 
used against clearly defined military targets and; will not be used 
where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited 
by civilians.

The bill also requires the President to submit a report to the 
appropriate Congressional committees on the plan to clean up unexploded 
cluster bombs.

Finally, the bill includes a national security waiver that allows the 
President to waive the prohibition on the use of cluster bombs with a 
failure rate of more than one percent, if he determines it is vital to 
protect the security of the United States to do so.

Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that 
contain up to hundreds of small submunitions, or individual 
''bomblets.''

They are intended for attacking enemy troop formations and armor 
covering over a half mile radius.

Yet, in practice, they pose a real threat to the safety of civilians 
when used in populated areas because they leave hundreds of unexploded 
bombs over a very large area and they are often inaccurate.

Indeed, the human toll of these weapons has been terrible:

In Laos, approximately 11,000 people, 30 percent of them children, 
have been killed or injured by U.S. cluster munitions since the Vietnam 
War ended.

In Afghanistan, between October 2001 and November 2002, 127 civilians 
lost their lives due to cluster munitions, 70 percent of them under the 
age of 18.

An estimated 1,220 Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians have been killed 
by cluster munitions since 1991.

In the 2006 war in Lebanon, Israeli cluster munitions, many of them 
manufactured in the U.S., injured and killed 200 civilians.

During the 2003 invasion of Baghdad, the last time the U.S. used 
cluster munitions, these weapons killed more civilians than any other 
type of U.S. weapon.

The U.S. 3rd Infantry Division described cluster munitions as 
''battlefield losers'' in Iraq, because they were often forced to 
advance through areas contaminated with unexploded duds.

During the 1991 Gulf War, U.S. cluster munitions caused more U.S. 
troop casualties than any single Iraqi weapon system, killing 22 U.S. 
servicemen.



Yet we have seen significant progress in the effort to protect 
innocent civilians from these deadly weapons since we first introduced 
this legislation in the 110th Congress.

In December, 95 countries came together to sign the Oslo Convention 
on Cluster Munitions which would prohibit the production, use, and 
export of cluster bombs and requires signatories to eliminate their 
arsenals within 8 years.

This group includes key NATO allies such as Canada, the United 
Kingdom, France, and Germany, who are fighting alongside our troops in 
Afghanistan.

In 2007, Congress passed and President Bush signed into law a 
provision from our legislation contained in the fiscal year 2008 
Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibiting the sale and transfer of 
cluster bombs with a failure rate of more than one percent.

In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the fiscal 
year 2009 State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations 
bill renewing the ban for another year.

I am confident this ban will be included in an fiscal year 2009 
Omnibus appropriations bill.

These actions will help save lives. But much more work remains to be 
done and significant obstacles remain.

For one, the United States chose not to participate in the Oslo 
process or sign the treaty.

The Pentagon continues to believe that cluster munitions are 
''legitimate weapons with clear military utility in combat.'' It would 
prefer that the United States work within the Geneva-based Convention 
on Certain Conventional Weapons, CCW, to negotiate limits on the use of 
cluster munitions.

Yet these efforts have been going on since 2001 and it was the 
inability of the CCW to come to any meaningful agreement which prompted 
other countries, led by Norway, to pursue an alternative treaty through 
the Oslo process.

A lack of U.S. leadership in this area has given cover to other major 
cluster munitions producing nations--China, Russia, India, Pakistan, 
Israel, and Egypt--who have refused to sign the Oslo Convention as 
well.

Recognizing the United States could not remain silent in the face of 
international efforts to restrict the use of cluster bombs, Secretary 
of Defense Robert Gates issued a new policy on cluster munitions in 
June 2008 stating that after 2018, the use, sale and transfer of 
cluster munitions with a failure rate of more than 1 percent would be 
prohibited.

The policy is a step in the right direction, but under the terms of 
this new policy, the Pentagon will still have the authority to use 
cluster bombs with high failure rates for the next ten years.

That is unacceptable and runs counter to our values.

The United States maintains an arsenal of an estimated 5.5 million 
cluster munitions containing 728 million submunitions which have an 
estimated failure rate of between 5 and 15 percent.

What does that say about us, that we are still prepared to use, sell 
and transfer these weapons with well known failure rates?

The fact is, cluster munition technologies already exist, that meet 
the one percent standard. Why do we need to wait ten years?

This delay is especially troubling given that in 2001, former 
Secretary of Defense William Cohen issued his own policy on cluster 
munitions stating that, beginning in fiscal year 2005, all new cluster 
munitions must have a failure rate of less than one percent.

Unfortunately, the Pentagon was unable to meet this deadline and 
Secretary Gates' new policy essentially postpones any meaningful action 
for another ten years.

That means, if we do nothing, by 2018 close to twenty years will have 
passed since the Pentagon first recognized the threat these deadly 
weapons pose to innocent civilians.

We can do better.

Our legislation simply moves up the Gates policy by ten years. For 
those of my colleagues who are concerned that it may be too soon to 
enact a ban on the use of cluster bombs with failure rates of more than 
one percent, I point out again that our bill allows the President to 
waive this restriction if he determines it is vital to protect the 
security of the United States to do so.

I would also remind my colleagues that the United States has not used 
cluster bombs in Iraq since 2003 and has observed a moratorium on their 
use in Afghanistan since 2002.

We introduced this legislation to make this moratorium permanent for 
the entire U.S. arsenal of cluster munitions.

We introduced this legislation for children like Hassan Hammade.

A 13-year-old Lebanese boy, Hassan lost four fingers and sustained 
injuries to his stomach and shoulder after he picked up an unexploded 
cluster bomb in front of an orange tree.

He said:




 I started playing with it and it blew up. I didn't know it 


 was a cluster bomb--it just looked like a burned out piece of 


 metal.



 All the children are too scared to go out now, we just play 


 on the main roads or in our homes.


I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We should do 
whatever we can to protect more innocent children and other civilians 
from these dangerous weapons.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be 
printed in the Record.
