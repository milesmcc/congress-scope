Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today I want to talk just a little bit 
about some of my encounters with my constituents over the weekend. What 
they are saying when I meet them is, what is going on in Washington? 
What is happening up there? We thought we were going to see a different 
type of environment. But you know what, it seems like nothing is 
getting done.

Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, they are right on the mark, because we 
are zero in '07 on the six for '06 that the leadership had promised 
that they were going to do.

More importantly to my constituents, and especially to some of those 
at Fort Campbell that I had the opportunity to spend time with on 
Sunday evening as they had their Normandy barbecue, the number one 
question was, what is going on with the Iraq supplemental? It is truly 
a disservice to our men and women in uniform for this not to be passed. 
Our troops in the field need that funding.

Other constituents were saying, what is this we are hearing about 
this budget? My goodness, the single largest tax increase in history?

Yes, indeed. And I can guarantee you, Mr. Speaker, many of us will 
stand in the gap to keep that from becoming law.
