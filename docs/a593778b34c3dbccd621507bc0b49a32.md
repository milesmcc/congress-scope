Mr. SCHUMER. Indeed. I thank my colleague for asking the question. 
Again, the minority says it is our job to take some tough votes. Here, 
here. We want to take what is a tough vote for some: Are you for the 
surge? Are you for the escalation or are you against it? They are doing 
everything they can to avoid it. But as my good friend from 
Massachusetts has so aptly pointed out, the bottom line is that now is 
the time to go on record--now, before most of the troops are there; 
now, when we can ratchet up pressure on the President to change his 
policy, as the independent study group said, and so many generals have 
said. I might add, from the press reports, the Prime Minister of Iraq 
doesn't want them. We are almost in Alice in Wonderland here.

I will say one other thing. The good news is simple: the American 
people get it. They know that the war in Iraq doesn't have a strategy. 
They know it is headed toward a dead end. They know that policing a 
civil war makes no sense, and they know what we are trying to do, which 
is forcing a ''yes'' or ''no'' vote--get a ''yes'' or ''no'' vote and 
move forward to change that strategy. No amount of wordsmithing on the 
other side is going to change that fact.

Today, the Republican minority said: We are for the surge, and we 
will let the President go forward and do it.

I yield to my colleague for another question.
