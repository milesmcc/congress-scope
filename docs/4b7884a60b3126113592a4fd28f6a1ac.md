`Mr. ARCURI â€” 26 February 2008`

Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, as a recipient of the nastiest attack ad in 
the last election cycle, I was sad to see this past weekend that it's 
already started. Yes, the Swift Boat crews were out and at it again, 
this time trying to convince the American people that because some 
Members of Congress felt it was better for our security to extend the 
FISA bill for 21 days rather than let it expire, that somehow they 
don't care about America's security. Well, that's not only untrue, it's 
downright insulting.

And the rationale: We should just trust the President's judgment on 
this matter and rubber-stamp his decisions. This is the same President 
who assured us that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 
Well, I want the cowards who crafted these intentionally deceiving 
messages to know that I was not sent to Congress to be a rubber stamp 
for this President or anyone else. I will continue to voice my 
opposition to the President whenever it is necessary to ensure the 
rights guaranteed under the Constitution are protected.
