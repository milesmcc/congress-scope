Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, today we are sending a clear message that 
our commitment to the Iraqi people will be ongoing, but that our 
military presence will not be permanent. Over and over this Congress 
and the American people have clearly called for an end to the 
occupation in Iraq. We are calling for bold action, action to bring our 
troops home and return Iraq to the Iraqi people.

The actions of this administration have clearly put our troops in 
danger.


Troops were sent in without adequate training, and even yet without 
appropriate equipment, and now our heroic soldiers are being returned 
to extended and repeated tours of duty. All of this is unacceptable, 
and now the administration says they want to leave the troops there for 
future Presidents to sort out the mess.

We say ''no way.'' No more putting our troops in danger, and no 
permanent bases. Show the American people, show the Iraqis, show the 
international community we have no plans to occupy Iraq. Vote ''yes'' 
on the Lee amendment.
