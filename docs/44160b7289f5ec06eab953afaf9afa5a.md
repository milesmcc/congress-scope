`Mr. HUNTER â€” 31 July 2008`

---


Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the service 
and sacrifice of Cpl Chad Michael Watson who lost a leg in an 
improvised explosive device attack. While on patrol in the Anbar 
province in Iraq on November 29, 2006, Chad's vehicle came under attack 
and he was severely wounded and later lost his right leg.

The son of Mike and Gina Watson, Chad was born in Mount Zion, 
Illinois on February 8, 1983. He attended Mount Zion High School 
graduating in 2004. Chad joined the Marine Corps May 17, 2004 and was 
trained as an infantryman. Following his initial training he deployed 
to Iraq with Charlie Company, 1st Infantry Battalion, and 24th Marines 
where he served until his injury.

During the twenty months of recovery, Chad maintained a positive and 
even uplifting attitude which reflected well among those fellow marines 
and soldiers passing through the recovery process at Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center. Mr. Albert Caswell of the U.S. Capitol Guide Service, a 
friend of his, penned the following poem as a fitting tribute to Chad 
for his sacrifice and unrelenting commitment to his long and enduring 
recovery.














 Breaking Chad. . .



 Breaking Bad!


 Breaking Chad! He's Good, but he's the good king of Bad. . .


 A Marine's Marine, one Fine Fighting Machine! The kind of 





 son, you wish you had!


 First in boot camp. . .


 First in his class in military school . . . training with his 





 brothers in arms, as number one he'd rule. . .


 Wherever hearts of courage roam, men like Chad have come home 





 with but their hearts of heroism full. . .


 A Hero who went off to war. . .


 Who lost a leg, but came back with so much more!


 With his courage full, over our hearts he rules . . . as he 





 takes us all to school . . . is that not what heaven is 





 for?


 Upon, battlefields of honor seen!


 Running towards death, as he was strong . . . fast and lean . 





 . . a real bad fighting machine! Upon the scene!


 The kind of guy you'd fight for and not ask why . . . ready 





 to die for you and his United States Marines!


 For in our Country Tis of Thee. . .


 There have been many heroes such as these who heard the call 





 . . . who did not pause, as did he!


 Who are but rough & ready, while in the face of hell were 





 ever steady . . . for their colors did not run, you 





 see!


 And now his new fight. . .


 To rebuild his life, with his fine and future wife . . . 





 teaching us all what is right!


 'Oh what a heck of a sight, bringing tears to eyes . . . as 





 he does not ask why . . . bringing to our world his 





 light!
