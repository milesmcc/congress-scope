Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Ambassador Richard 
Holbrooke, who unexpectedly passed away this week. My husband, 
Ambassador Sidney Williams, and I are very saddened that friend is no 
longer with us.

We first had the opportunity to meet Ambassador Holbrooke during 
diplomatic training in 1993. Sidney and Richard had recently been 
appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve as the Ambassadors to the 
Bahamas and Germany, respectively. As is required of the spouse of an 
incoming Ambassador, I also went through training to understand certain 
diplomatic protocol and procedure.

I have fond memories of that time, and I remember Richard as an 
extremely bright, articulate, and worldly man. He had an imposing 
presence, a keen intellect and a sharp wit, which had clearly served 
him well in the decades he trotted the globe making peace, shaping 
policy, and advancing our interests abroad.

Shortly after we met, he was dispatched to serve as the key 
negotiator to the 1995 Dayton peace accords, which ended the Bosnian 
War. I remember thinking that they could not find someone with more 
expertise or wherewithal to undertake such a complex and important 
task.

Whether in Vietnam or Afghanistan, the Johnson administration or the 
Obama administration, a dais at the United Nations or the theater of 
war, Richard served our country and the international community with 
grace, with strength, and with distinction.

Our diplomatic community, indeed, our country, has lost a tried and 
true public servant. During this difficult time, I take some comfort in 
knowing that the world is a better place because of Ambassador Richard 
Holbrooke, and I hope anyone who knew him will do the same.

My husband and I extend our deepest sympathies, our thoughts and our 
prayers to his wife, his children, his family and his many friends and 
colleagues.
