`Mr. YARMUTH â€” 17 July 2008`

Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman from Colorado, and I appreciate 
his excellent work on this issue.

Mr. Speaker, the one thing that's encouraging about this debate is 
that we all agree in this Chamber that we need to do something about 
high gas prices. We need to do something to reduce our dependence on 
oil. We need to do something pretty quickly because the American people 
are hurting. The economy is feeling the impact of these prices, and 
immediate action is required.

Now, let's consider the two options that we have before us. We have 
the option that has been put forward by our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, which basically is to open up new areas of potential 
oil reserves for drilling, which everyone agrees is a solution that 
will not manifest itself until years down the road. The Bush Energy 
Department, itself, says no appreciable reduction in gas prices will 
occur from drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf or in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge until 2030.

As attested by my colleague from Colorado, the average American 
family will spend $57,000 on gasoline before the Republican plan saves 
them a penny. That is hardly the kind of relief that the American 
people are looking for.

There was a very wise man once who said the significant problems we 
face today will never be solved by the same level of thinking that got 
us into those problems. That was Albert Einstein, a pretty smart guy, 
and that's what the Republican plan is. It's to do more of the same to 
solve the problems that we're now in. I think the American people are 
much smarter than to fall for that type of proposition.

On the other hand, the Democratic majority has a plan that can reduce 
oil prices virtually immediately. We call it Free America's Oil because 
we do have plenty of oil at our disposal to use to bring down prices 
immediately. That is only half the problem, though, because, as my 
colleague from Colorado mentioned, we've got a long-range proposition 
to deal with. We don't want to find ourselves year after year after 
year in the same dilemma in which we find ourselves now. We've got to 
look in a different direction. I'll return to that in a second, but 
let's talk about the immediate action we can take.

We have 700 million barrels of oil right now that the United States 
owns that are sitting in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 700 million 
barrels. When we invaded Iraq, we took that down to 600 million. When 
we had the Katrina disaster, we went to about 600 million barrels. We 
have far more oil in the Reserve than we will ever need for any 
eventuality. If we were to release just 10 percent of the oil in the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 70 million barrels, into the market over 
the next few months, history has shown us that we can immediately 
impact the price of oil.

There are three times in the last 17 years that we've done it. The 
first was in 1991. The most recent was in 2005. Each time we did it, 
the price of oil dropped, in 2005 by 10 percent, in 1991 by a third. 
Wouldn't it be great to have oil down under $100 a barrel. Again, it 
seems hard to imagine that we're actually thinking that would be a 
desirable goal, but at $140, it would be very desirable.



We can do that if the President just uses his authority to release 
that oil. We own it. It's ours. We have paid for it. We can use it to 
benefit the American people and get action now.

Two other things we're proposing can bring relief in the relatively 
short term. First, we have 68 million acres onshore and offshore 
already under lease to oil companies. They can drill virtually 
immediately. They don't need to do exploration. They don't need to 
clear environmental hurdles as they would in these other areas they 
want to drill. They can drill tomorrow. We have a proposal. We call it 
''use it or lose it.'' It's part of our ''free America's oil'' proposal 
that if we pressure the oil companies by threatening to take those 
leases away if they don't make a good-faith effort to produce on them, 
we can encourage them, again, to use the resources we already have to 
get oil onto the market, increase the supply and bring the price down.

Finally, we have in Alaska, west of the area that they want us to 
drill in, the wildlife refuge, 23 million acres that are already 
available for drilling. It's called, ironically enough, the National 
Petroleum Reserve area because there is petroleum there, estimates up 
to 10.6 billion barrels of oil, more than would ever be in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge. We want them to drill there, not in a 
pristine area where we don't know how much oil exists. So again, we 
have options. We have oil on American soil. We have oil we own that we 
can use to bring prices down in the very short term. And we ought to be 
embracing that policy.

One other mention about the long-term effects. President Bush said 
the other day that the reason we need to open up all these other oil 
areas, potential oil areas, is because of the psychological effect, 
because if the oil speculators know that down the road there is this 
massive supply coming on, the price will drop. If that is what we are 
relying on, I say we have a much better chance to affect the psychology 
of the market if we change our emphasis from oil to alternative and 
renewable fuels, alternative sources of power. We know the technology 
is there. We just have to invest in it, develop it and refine it. But 
that is the kind of psychological effect, the knowledge among 
speculators not just that there will be more oil on the market 20 years 
from now, but we won't need any oil 20 years from now because we're 
going to go in another direction. The psychological effect of that will 
be compelling and will be devastating to oil prices.

So I say we have a plan both for short-term and long-term energy 
policy that does make sense, that is not the same old rhetoric and that 
is not the same level of thinking, as Einstein said, that we had that 
got us into this problem. And I think the American people know that 
this is the direction we need to go on. And I think that by responding 
today, by passing the DRILL Act, that we can take the first step 
towards energy independence and toward helping the American consumer 
deal with these incredibly high prices.
