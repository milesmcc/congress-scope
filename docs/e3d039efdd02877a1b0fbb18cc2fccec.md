Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, my friend from 
Florida, for yielding, and also thank the chairman of the Veterans' 
Affairs Committee, Mr. Filner, for his leadership, as well as the 
author of this important legislation, Mr. Boswell of Iowa, and all of 
those who have worked to bring this legislation to the floor.

I have talked, Mr. Speaker, to the mother and the stepmother of 
Marine Lance Corporal Jonathan Schulze of Minnesota. I have talked to 
the stepmother, who, along with Jonathan's father, took this young 
marine to the VA hospital seeking admission. Lance Corporal Schulze, 
back from the war in Iraq, was suffering from depression, post-
traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, and was suicidal.

I have talked to this mother and stepmother who, along with 
Jonathan's father, are absolutely heartbroken at the loss of their 
beloved son and this true American hero, Lance Corporal Schulze. He was 
told by the VA that he was number 26 on the waiting list and would have 
to wait several months to be admitted for treatment. Five days later, 
Lance Corporal Schulze hanged himself with an electrical cord.

This brave marine's tragic death demonstrates to all of us, to the 
Nation, the urgent need to provide greater access to mental health 
treatment for our returning troops and our veterans.

None of our brave troops, none of our brave troops, suffering from 
PTSD should ever be placed on a waiting list for treatment. It is 
absolutely, Mr. Speaker, outrageous, that mental health treatment is 
not readily available for our brave troops returning from war.

That is why I am proud and grateful to rise as a cosponsor of the 
Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. This legislation will 
provide necessary screening to our returning veterans for risk factors 
of suicide. It will make sure that those found to be at risk will 
receive the care that they need and deserve.

It is too late, Mr. Speaker, for Lance Corporal Jonathan Schulze of 
Minnesota, but it is not too late for thousands and thousands of other 
returning troops and veterans. It is time to pass this critical bill.

But we must do more. We must pass mental health and chemical 
addiction parity. There are 56 million Americans suffering the ravages 
of mental illness, most of whom are going untreated. There are 24 
million Americans suffering the ravages of alcoholism and drug 
addiction, many, many veterans who are going untreated.

We must also, in addition to this important legislation, pass the 
Mental Health Equity Act to provide equitable treatment for people 
suffering from mental illness and chemical addiction; that is, to put 
them on the same footing as people suffering from physical diseases.

We also, Mr. Speaker, must pass the Lane Evans VA Reform Act, which 
is more comprehensive, provides more resources to the VA and more 
access to treatment for our veterans.

Mr. Speaker, as I said, it is too late for Lance Corporal Schulze of 
Minnesota. It is too late for Staff Sergeant Omvig of Iowa. But it is 
not too late for our other veterans.

Let's do the right thing. Let's pass this legislation.

I thank the gentleman for his leadership.
