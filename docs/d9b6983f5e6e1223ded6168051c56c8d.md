Mr. FARR. We sent our troops to war in Afghanistan, but after more 
than 8 years of war, we are only now actively trying to support peace. 
For years, I have worked to develop a Civilian Response Corps that can 
bring the whole of government approach to winning the peace.

We have proven time and time again that we can kick down doors, but 
we have not yet proven that we can build peace. We are finally standing 
up the Civilian Response Corps, and we are finally developing the 
capacity so that war without end is not our only option.

In the recent operation in Marjah, the military aspect of the 
operation started in February 12, and by February 25 the Afghan flag 
was raised. This week, Afghan President Karzai, together with General 
Stanley McChrystal, visited Marjah. They met with elders who told 
President Karzai they wanted Afghan troops, not international forces, 
in their town. They expressed frustration at the government's lack of 
ability to provide services. It is those public services--provided by a 
civilian corps supported by Afghan security--that will win the peace.

The long-term solution in Afghanistan will be a civilian solution, 
and the sooner we move to this next phase the better. For this reason, 
I believe a vote for success in Afghanistan is a vote for this 
resolution to remove our military troops by year's end.
