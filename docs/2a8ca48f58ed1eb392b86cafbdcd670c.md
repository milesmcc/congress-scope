`Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado â€” 22 April 2010`

Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, there are many heroes from 
Colorado who have fought and continue to fight in the global war on 
terror. Today I rise to pay tribute to one hero in particular, Army 
Sergeant Sean Durkin of Aurora, Colorado.

On March 27, 2010, Sergeant Sean Durkin and his fellow soldiers were 
on a mission near Forward Operating Base Wilson in Afghanistan when 
their convoy was struck by an explosive device. Sergeant Sean Durkin 
and two other brave soldiers exited the vehicle to respond to the blast 
but were all injured when a second improvised explosive device went 
off. Sergeant Sean Durkin was gravely wounded and ultimately succumbed 
to his injuries while at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

In 2004, Sergeant Sean Durkin graduated from Eaglecrest High School 
in Colorado. Sergeant Sean Durkin is a shining example of Army service 
and sacrifice. As a former member of the Army and as a retired Marine 
officer, my deepest sympathies go out to his family and to all who knew 
him.
