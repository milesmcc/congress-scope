`Mr. HAGEL â€” 19 September 2007`

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge my friend, the junior 
Senator from Virginia, and also recognize his leadership, not just on 
this issue that he has framed over the last few minutes on which the 
Senate will be voting, as we did in July, but his years of 
contributions to this country--specifically his efforts on behalf of 
our military. I think most of us recognize the distinguished record of 
Senator Jim Webb, that service to his country. We appreciate that, and 
in particular his leadership on this amendment is important.

Senator Webb and I wrote this amendment many months ago. We 
introduced it on the floor of the Senate in July. We received 56 
bipartisan votes for it. As Senator Webb has noted in his explanation 
of what this amendment does, it is relevant to our Armed Forces, to our 
country, and to our future. I wish to take a little time to expand on a 
couple of the points Senator Webb has made.

First, a democracy of 300 million people, the greatest democracy in 
the world, the oldest living democracy in the world, finds itself in a 
situation today where we are asking about 1 percent of our citizens to 
carry all the burden, make all the sacrifices. We will be dealing with 
this issue for many years to come, because the consequences of what has 
been going on are that we are doing great damage to our military force 
structure, great damage to our Army and our Marines.

Senator Webb noted some examples. These are not isolated episodes. 
The fact is, you cannot grind down your people, you cannot grind down 
your force structure as we have been doing to our force structure over 
the last years--redeployment after redeployment, and longer and longer 
deployments.

We know, because our generals and admirals tell us, that this will 
come to an end sometime next spring, the rate of redeployments. Why is 
that the case? That is the case because we can't sustain the force 
structure we have assigned in Iraq today. It is not because I say it or 
Senator Webb says it, but our professional military leaders say it.

It doesn't do us much good to go back and review the mistakes we have 
made over the last 5 years, first when we invaded and occupied a 
country. The fact is, we never had enough force structure in that 
country. Many Senators, including the distinguished ranking Republican 
on the Armed Services Committee, our friend John McCain, noted that. He 
still talks about it, as many of us do. This administration refused to 
take the counsel of the then Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General 
Eric Shinseki, when he, in open hearing before the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, was asked the question: What will it take, General, 
to invade, occupy, and help stabilize Iraq? He said it would take 
hundreds of thousands of American forces.

He was right. He was right. But this administration chose not to 
listen to the Chief of Staff of the Army, who knew far more about the 
details of manpower requirements than anyone in the White House.

We are not going to go back and unwind all that series of bad 
decisions. We are where we are, and we are in a mess in Iraq today by 
any dynamic, any measurement, any qualifications. We heard about that, 
I think in some detail, as we probed General Petraeus and Ambassador 
Crocker's testimony last week--two distinguished Americans. General 
Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are two of our best. But the military 
doesn't set policy. The civilian leadership sets policy. So we hand 
that off to the military. They salute; they say, Yes, sir. Now, you go 
implement the policy.

What we are addressing in this amendment is not only a basic 
component of fairness in how you treat your people--because, after all, 
as we know, it is people who represent the greatest resource of an 
institution, of a country, of a society. When you grind those people 
down to a point where they just cannot be effective, but when the 
morale is gone, when they leave the institution as we are seeing happen 
in the Army and Marines, when you are 15,000 short of Army captains and 
lieutenant colonels and majors, and senior enlisted, and story after 
story--every Senator in this body can relate these specific stories 
like I had in my office yesterday. A Marine Corps officer, couple of 
years in Iraq, 14 years in the Marines, got out. He loved the Marines. 
It pulled his heart out to leave the Marines.

I said, Why did you leave?

He said, Sir, I tried to balance my family life. The last time I got 
back from Iraq my youngest daughter said, Daddy, I am going to tape you 
to the refrigerator so you don't have to leave again.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said in 
his confirmation hearing a few months ago, and I quote from Admiral 
Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:




 I am concerned about the number of deployments, the time 


 when they're home--in fact, even when they are home, there's 


 training associated with that, so they spend




 weeks, if not months, out of their own house, again, away 


 from their families, and I believe we've got to relieve that.


That is the end of the quote from the new Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. So, are we really asking so much here when we say that 
our brave fighting men and women, who are bearing all the burden, 
carrying all the sacrifice for this country, that 1 percent of our 
society, that we say they ought to have at least the same amount of 
downtime off as they serve in a war zone in combat? Is that outrageous?

We in this town are very good at abstractions. We talk about 
policies. We act like moving men and brigades in combat--that somehow 
this is a chess game. Somehow these people are objects.

No, humanity is always the underlying dynamic of the world and life 
and it always will be. As Senator Webb has often said: Who speaks for 
the military? The National spokesmen.

Their leaders are appointed by the President. They have spokesmen, 
they are Governors, if no one else. But who speaks for the rifleman? 
Who speaks for the people whom we ask to go fight and die and their 
families?

Now, let's be very clear about another issue. As Senator Webb has 
noted, this certainly is within the constitutional authority and 
responsibility of the Congress of the United States. Senator Webb said 
article I of the Constitution is about the Congress. Section 8 of the 
Constitution, in article I, speaks specifically to Congress's 
responsibilities. We can have disagreements about policies and 
strategies, and that is appropriate, should be, absolutely, in a 
democracy. But let's not be confused about our responsibilities as 
well.

The fact is, as General Shinseki warned us in his comments before the 
Senate Armed Services Committee before we invaded Iraq, that it would 
take hundreds of thousands of American soldiers.

What has happened is we have a mission that does not match our 
manpower capabilities. So what is this administration's answer? Keep 
grinding down the people out there who have been fighting and dying. 
Keep grinding them down more because we do not have any choice. Are you 
going to suit the Boy Scouts up on the weekends?

Where is the manpower going to come from? So the easy answer is--
because who speaks for the rifleman? Who speaks for the military? You 
keep asking them to do more. You keep pushing more down on them.

By the way, the so-called surge the President of the United States 
announced to America in January--by the way, I do not find the term 
''surge'' in any military manuals. Surge is not a policy, it is not a 
strategy, it is a tactic.

But the President said: This is temporary. That escalation of troops, 
that 30,000 more troops on top of the 130,000 troops they already had 
over there, that is temporary. Because we are going to buy time for the 
Iraqi Government to find an accommodation so there can be political 
reconciliation. In the end, that is all that counts. As General 
Petraeus and everybody, every one of our great generals has said, there 
is no military solution in Iraq.

General Petraeus and every general has said that. They know it better 
than anyone knows it. The only solution in Iraq is going to come from, 
must come from, some political accommodation resulting in a political 
reconciliation.

So let's buy more time, let's grind those guys down more. Well, it 
will automatically come to some kind of an end. But in the process, 
what are we doing to our society, to our country, to our Armed Forces, 
that is going to take years to rebuild, just as General Schwarzkopf and 
General Powell and other great generals after Vietnam, they stayed in 
the military and rebuilt the military after what we had done to it 
during Vietnam.

This is a very modest step forward, of clear thinking. This is 
relevant. It is rational. This has at least a modicum of humanity in 
it. If we do not take these steps, the consequences we are going to 
continue to face are going to be severe.

I know the questions, the concerns on the other side of this issue 
are appropriate. Is this not a back-door way of trying to micromanage 
the war, micromanage our force structure? Well, the fact is, as I have 
already noted, we have inverted the logic. In order to carry out a 
mission or a policy or strategy, you have to match the resources for 
that. Those resources were never matched to that mission.

So the easy answer for all of us in Washington, and 99 percent of the 
American people, is: Well, let those guys over there do more. So we 
have 15-month deployments, in some cases they are 18-month deployments, 
in some cases they are longer than that. So what if they go over there 
three times.

That is not a good enough answer. That is a failed answer. That is 
irresponsible.

So I hope our colleagues take a hard look at this, and I hope they 
would give some intense thought to what we are doing, not only for the 
immediate term but for the long term. This is essential for our 
country. This has ramifications, societal implications that go far 
beyond our force structure.

I am very honored to be the original cosponsor and coauthor of this 
amendment with my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Virginia.

I yield the floor.
