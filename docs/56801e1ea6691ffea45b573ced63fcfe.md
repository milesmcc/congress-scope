Mr. REID. Mr. President, the smoke is housing crisis foreclosures. 
The fire is the general economy because the housing crisis has caused 
the economy to be in a state of distress.

The chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, made such an 
outstanding presentation this morning where he talked about almost 
8,000 homes every day--today, tomorrow, and the foreseeable future--
will be foreclosed upon, not the beginning process of foreclosure, but 
the termination of foreclosure. Someone by the name of Jones, Smith--
whatever their name might be--will lose their home, a family home.

What does that do to the neighborhood? Every time there is a home 
foreclosed upon, it immediately causes the rest of the neighborhood to 
be worth less money. What does it do to the government entity where 
that home is located? The government entity loses the ability to get 
tax money. No one benefits from foreclosures.

This is a step in the right direction. In Nevada, for example, 1 out 
of every 165 homes was in foreclosure in February. Can you imagine 
that, 1 out of every 165 homes. That is the highest rate in Nevada. We 
are fortunate we have a lot of construction that is not housing related 
that is going to pull us through this situation. It is important that 
we move forward on this legislation.

The underlying bill is a so-called Democratic bill. This bill, if we 
are able to accomplish something, will be a Senate bill. Democrats and 
Republicans can go home and take credit for doing something to help the 
problem.

Are we going to be able to resolve all the problems in housing? Of 
course not. But we can make a tremendous step forward, and that is what 
we intend to do.

I have worked with Senator Shelby from the time we were in the House 
together. We shared office space. His office in the Longworth Building 
was next to mine. I have the highest regard for him. I spoke with him 
this morning. I believe he and the chairman of the committee, Senator 
Dodd, are going to be able to come up with something that I hope I can 
support, but it is going to be bipartisan. They are going to agree on 
this and offer it as the first amendment when we get to this 
legislation. If something goes wrong, if someone is being mischievous 
about that legislation, Senator McConnell and I will meet again.

The goal is to do something about housing. We are not going to solve 
the problems of Iraq on this bill. We are not going to solve the tax 
policy of this country on this bill. We are not going to solve global 
warming on this housing bill. But we need to do something the American 
people recognize is bipartisan as it relates to housing, and we are 
going to do everything we can.

I believe the time has come for us to start legislating and stop 
talking about the need to legislate.

Mr. President, a vote has been called for 2:30. If there is someone 
else who wishes to speak, they certainly have the opportunity for the 
next few minutes.
