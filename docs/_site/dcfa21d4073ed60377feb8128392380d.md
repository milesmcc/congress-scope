Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, as the contentious and sometimes 
ugly debate over our strategy in Iraq continues here in Washington, 
it's important to remember that there are patriotic Americans helping 
with positive activity abroad and at home. And today it's my privilege 
to acknowledge the incredible work being done by some folks in my State 
of Georgia and all across this Nation. Operation Homefront is a 
national nonprofit organization founded in the wake of September 11. 
The decent and committed Americans at Operation Homefront are providing 
necessary assistance and comfort to our troops and their family.

Through financial assistance programs and other goods and services, 
these tireless volunteers are helping America's military families cope 
with the everyday difficulties that they face. They are truly making a 
difference.

Our military families deserve nothing less than the unending 
gratitude and support of our entire Nation. Thanks to Operation 
Homefront for their efforts. I encourage every American to get 
involved. And let's show our military men and women that we honor their 
sacrifice, and we will never forget all that they do to defend our 
freedom at home and abroad.
