`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 30 June 2010`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, my friend from Georgia's proposal 
represents less than one-tenth of 1 percent of what was borrowed to pay 
for the Iraq and Afghanistan war. Let's get serious here. And when I 
see that poster that says ''YouCut,'' what they don't


show you is what they're cutting and what they want to cut is Social 
Security, and the minority leader made that very clear in his 
interview, that they're going to basically take money out of Social 
Security to pay for the wars. Our senior citizens who have fought in 
wars, who have worked in our factories, who have raised our families 
are being told to pay for the wars.

I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee.)
