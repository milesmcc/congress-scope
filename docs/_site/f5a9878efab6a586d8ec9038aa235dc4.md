Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, today, the Indiana National Guard is hosting 
a National Guard Day at the Indiana Statehouse. This event will 
highlight our Hoosier citizen soldiers' capabilities, and provide an 
update as to their status as they prepare to deploy to Iraq. The event 
will also show strong support for the families of our Hoosier 
Guardmembers.

I applaud Maj. Gen. Umbarger's work with the Indiana National Guard. 
He has been an unwavering champion of the Indiana National Guard. His 
efforts today are to show support for Guardmembers and their families, 
as well as to help elected leaders and citizens better understand the 
role of the National Guard.

On this day, I too would like to express my support and deepest 
thanks to our Guardmembers, and their families. Many of these brave men 
and women are preparing to leave their homes, their loved ones, and 
their lives stateside in order to defend our Nation. Their commitment 
to duty and steadfast determination is an example to Hoosiers, and all 
Americans alike. They all deserve our most heartfelt thanks and 
admiration. Our Hoosier Guardmembers and their families will be in my 
prayers.
