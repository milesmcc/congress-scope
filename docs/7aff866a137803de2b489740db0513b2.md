Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, within the last month, the 
American people have seen just how misplaced President Bush's 
priorities are when it comes to addressing the needs of hardworking 
Americans.

Earlier this month, the President vetoed a bipartisan bill that would 
have provided 10 million children private health insurance through the 
SCHIP program. The bill cost an additional $35 billion over the next 5 
years, and would have allowed us to receive 4 million more uninsured 
children. Instead, the President suggested a mere $5 billion increase, 
which would lead to more than 800,000 children losing their health 
insurance coverage.

Contrast that with the President's announcement last week that he was 
requesting an additional $189 billion in emergency funds over the next 
year for the war in Iraq, which was $42 billion higher than originally 
thought.

Fortunately, most Americans, Senators and Governors have caught on to 
the President's misplaced priorities. But Republicans here in the House 
continue to blindly follow this President. And just as they refused to 
join us last week in standing by these 10 million kids, House 
Republicans will most likely sign off on the President's war funding 
request without ever asking a single question.
