Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to remind everyone here and 
throughout the country that our President needs our help. The President 
needs our help to support our troops before, during, and after serving 
in harm's way, and to guarantee our soldiers receive everything 
necessary to heal their wounds from battles fought on our behalf.

The President needs our help to fulfill Abe Lincoln's promise to our 
veterans, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his 
widow and orphans. The President needs our help to hold the freely 
elected Iraqi Government accountable to his own benchmarks. And the 
President needs our help to accept the new direction away from Iraq 
back towards al Qaeda.

The people of Wisconsin urge the President to sign the Iraqi 
Accountability Act, for in doing so he will be able to once again tell 
our troops and all the American people: ''Mission Accomplished.''

Mr. President, the American people hope you will accept our help.
