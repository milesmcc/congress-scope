# AMERICA SPEAKING OUT

Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I'm here to speak about a program called 
America Speaking Out. You can put that into Google, ''America Speaking 
Out,'' and go to YouTube, in which Kevin McCarthy explains it in a 
little bit more detail.

But the idea behind it is to ask the American people what would they 
like on their agenda, what do we need to be doing in Washington. 
Because one of the big complaints I get back home is, you know, You 
folks are up there and you seem to be in a bubble. You ignore what we 
want to do; you attach things to bills that don't belong there, and 
then you force through legislation and it's out of sync with the 
American people.

So the idea of America Speaking Out is to give the grassroots voters 
back home a little bit of an opportunity, and more of an opportunity 
than they get now, to be heard. And you can weigh in on the Web page 
and say, I want you to work on education as your top priority; I want 
you to bring the budget in, cut spending, top priority; I want you to 
finish up in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Whatever it is, we seek the input of the American people so that the 
Republican Party can work on an agenda.
