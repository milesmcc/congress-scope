`Mr. BRADY of Texas â€” 9 December 2009`

Mr. BRADY of Texas. I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that when 
Republicans lost control of Congress, the deficit was $160 billion, too 
high. Today, just 2/1/2/ years later, it is nearly nine times that 
high. It is greater than all the deficits in 1 year and all the 
deficits under President Bush. We are on an unsustainable path where 
our children and grandchildren will never be able to afford what is 
being spent today.

And I will remind, too, my friend from Massachusetts that when 
Democrats took that gavel, Speaker Pelosi pledged she would pay every 
dime of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nearly 3 years later, they 
haven't paid for a dime of those wars.

Let me make a point here. The reason I think Congress' approval 
ratings are lower than Bernie Madoff's is that we keep pitting 
Americans against other Americans. In this case, we keep pitting 
teachers and research workers and local taxpayers, you hear the 
numbers, against our local real estate workers and our local 
construction workers. This bill will seriously damage our ability to 
create jobs and raise property values at the local level. Our real 
estate partners, the real target of this bill, the real losers in this 
bill, these are average people who build our local facilities, who 
create construction jobs, who are the backbone of our economy. And in 
this case, they will have their taxes nearly tripled. It will


result in lower property values and fewer jobs at home.

What it really does is it punishes people who put in sweat equity and 
work for decades to bring it about. And it forces them to go to the 
bank and take debt, to seek capital at a time when there is no bank and 
no lending available. So we have taken one of the toughest parts of our 
economy, commercial real estate, and punished them. It is a false 
choice, as the gentleman from Michigan has said. It's the wrong choice. 
This is a bad deal.
