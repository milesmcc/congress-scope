## `7a737aa5a84b5ea239e6ab5edf384a4a`
`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 25 February 2009`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 184 provides for the consideration 
of H.R. 1105, the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009. The rule provides 
1 hour of debate controlled by the Committee on Appropriations, and one 
motion to recommit with or without instructions. The rule also self-
executes an amendment that blocks the automatic cost-of-living 
adjustment due to be provided to Members of Congress in 2010.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the 
Fiscal Year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act.

This bill, Mr. Speaker, represents the completion of last year's 
work. We are in this position today for one principal reason, George W. 
Bush failed to provide budgets that reflected the real needs of the 
American people. And his philosophy was essentially ''my way or the 
highway.''

If he had gotten his way last year, he would have cut energy 
efficiency, renewable energy and weatherization programs. He would have 
cut education by eliminating vocational education programs, slashing 
higher education programs, and cutting programs to help teachers and 
improve technology. He would have cut healthcare access programs, even 
as the number of uninsured Americans grew. He would have frozen 
biomedical research funding and cut the Centers for Disease Control. 
And he would have cut State and local law enforcement grants and job 
training, employment services and worker protections curing this 
economic crisis.

So today, our job is to fix things, to clean up the mess of the last 
administration, and to help the American people.

Last night, President Obama gave an incredible speech, and he 
promised to do things differently. He promised an honest accounting of 
our Nation's needs. That may not seem revolutionary, but it's a big and 
positive change from the past 8 years.

For the first time, the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan 
will actually be included in the budget. The costs won't be covered up 
or hidden. No more gimmicks. The American people will know the real 
costs of these wars.

We will anticipate and budget for Federal dollars in response to 
national disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and earthquakes.

And President Obama, last night, pledged to cut the deficit in half 
by the year 2012, a promise to bring back fiscal responsibility. In 
short, there will be more truth-telling.

Mr. Speaker, we need to move forward, and I believe that we will. But 
first we need to dispense with last year's business.

Some of my friends on the other side complain that we shouldn't pass 
this omnibus bill today because it's too expensive. They complain that 
it will add to the deficit. It's interesting to hear my friends on the 
other side of the aisle worry out loud about the deficit. Where have 
they been for the last 8 years?

Facts are a stubborn thing, Mr. Speaker, and the facts speak for 
themselves. We are facing the worst economic crisis since the Great 
Depression, and we have the biggest debt in the history of the United 
States of America. This is something we inherited from my friends on 
the other side of the aisle. So it is somewhat ironic that the very 
people who drove this economy into a ditch are now complaining about 
the size of the tow truck.

I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we need to do whatever possible to get 
this economy back on track and to help the American people. The 
policies of the past, the same old same old, they failed. I believe 
this President has the political will to do the right thing. I believe 
he will get the economy back on track and he will get our fiscal house 
in order. And I believe that this Congress will support him.

What is before us, to put it simply, is help for States, cities and 
towns and for average people. There's an increase over current levels 
of appropriations. This, combined with the Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act, provides a lot of help to a lot of people.

This is not the bill, Mr. Speaker, that I would have written if it 
were solely up to me, and I don't believe it is the bill that Chairman 
Obey would have written if it was solely up to him. This bill reflects 
bipartisan negotiations and bipartisan compromises.

I want to see more money in this bill, Mr. Speaker, for roads and 
bridges, more money for international food aid and anti-hunger programs 
like the McGovern-Dole Program and Food for Peace, and more money to 
combat climate change. I want to see Pell Grants fully funded, and I 
want to make sure that all eligible children receive a meal during the 
summer months if they receive a meal during the school year.

But I'm glad that we have reversed the Bush cuts on domestic 
priorities. I'm proud of the increased funding for WIC in this bill, 
funding that will help low-income pregnant mothers and newborns receive 
the healthy food that they need. And I'm pleased that this bill 
provides a 19 percent increase for the Food and Drug Administration, 
funding that will be used for critical oversight of our Nation's food 
supply


so we don't have any more contamination scares like the recent peanut 
contamination cases that we've recently seen.

This bill also increases funding for the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act by providing $558 million above 2008 for a 
total of $11.5 billion. And this bill provides $550 million for the 
COPS program, a program critical to the safety of our cities and towns.

Mr. Speaker, we need to get this bill completed. We need to finish 
the job left over from the last Congress and turn the page, once and 
for all, on the last 8 years. I urge my colleagues to support this rule 
and the bill.

I reserve the balance of my time.
