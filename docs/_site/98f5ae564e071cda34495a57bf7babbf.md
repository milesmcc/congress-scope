Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Chair, I want to rise in support of the 
amendment offered by the gentlelady from Texas.

The women of Afghanistan have taken great strides since the fall of 
the Taliban to fully take part in all aspects of their society. Women 
have realized significant gains in the last several years. However, 
much remains to be done.

Laws and regulations passed to safeguard the rights of women must be 
enforced and respected at the provincial and local levels in order to 
ensure that women make progress throughout all aspects of Afghan 
society. It is critical that women legislators of Afghanistan receive 
the necessary training and support that they need to prevent a return 
to the intimidation, to the discrimination, to the violence that they 
faced under the Taliban.



I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

I yield back the balance of my time.
