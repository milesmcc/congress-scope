# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `62b13bc7a34af798ba9bc7cd9faf28ed`
`Mr. WELDON of Florida â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to address H. Con. Res. 63, disapproving of the 
decision of the President announced on January 10, 2007 to deploy 
20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq.

This resolution essentially has, by my interpretation, three 
sections. It has the first section, which speaks in support of our 
troops; and then it has the second section, disapproving of the mission 
of 20,000 of the troops, which is a little bit of an inconsistency. We 
are saying we support the troops, but we don't support what you are 
trying to do.

But the most important part of this resolution is the third section 
shown here in white. There is nothing there. No plan.

So the authors of this resolution are essentially saying, we don't 
approve of the President's plan but we have no plan to deal with this 
challenge.

Ladies and gentlemen, we won the war in Iraq. What we are struggling 
to win now is the peace, establishing a peaceful government that can 
run this country. And we have very determined opponents seeking to make 
sure that chaos reigns in that country and we do what this resolution 
is leading us to do, which is essentially to leave.

Indeed, a senior member on that side of the aisle recently said in 
the press that, ''This is the bark, and the bite is coming.'' We 
supposedly support the troops, but what is next is no funding for the 
troops; that this Congress under this new leadership is going to 
exercise the power of the purse and cut off the flow of money.

But, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues, this is not Vietnam. The 
war in Iraq in not going to go away. It is going to continue to be a 
problem. If we do withdraw our troops, as many in this room want us to 
do, the war on terror will continue.

We had a meeting today with the Ambassador from Jordan and the 
Ambassador from Egypt asking us not to withdraw; that we have to stay 
and persist and to try to establish a peaceful regime there. And they 
have their reasons, because they know this is a component of the war on 
terror. And the war on terror is a bad term; it is a war on radical 
fundamentalist jihadist Islam. And these jihadists are not going to 
stop coming at us. Indeed, since over the last 4 years, there have been 
attack after attack after attack in Bali, in Spain, in London, and they 
are going to keep coming after Western interests, because their goal 
and their agenda is to defeat the West, to defeat everything we stand 
for, and to ultimately establish a global fundamentalist Islamic 
regime.

I oppose this resolution. I am going to vote against it, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the 
same. The President's plan was recommended to us in the Iraq Study 
Group. It is amazing, many of the people who are saying they are going 
to vote for this supported the Iraq Study Group, and the Iraq Study 
Group recommended many of the components that are in the President's 
plan. We need to give this time to work. I know the American people are 
losing patience in this conflict, but I also know the stakes in this 
conflict are huge. And if we fail, the consequences could be huge to 
the region, they will be huge to the world, they will be huge to the 
American people and our children and our grandchildren.

So I strongly encourage a ''no'' vote on this resolution
