# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010
## `6279d2bc969c3710d54bc9574315b476`
`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 1 July 2010`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the McGovern-
Obey-Jones amendment. Quite simply, all this amendment does is make 
sure that the President and the Congress be accountable to the American 
people, our troops, and their families about what our policy in 
Afghanistan is going to be from July 2011 onward.

At this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
Obey), chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
