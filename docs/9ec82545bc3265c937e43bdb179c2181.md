# TRIBUTE TO OFFICER IAN DEUTCH
## `9ec82545bc3265c937e43bdb179c2181`
`Mr. REID â€” 27 April 2010`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, 60 miles outside Las Vegas is a rural 
community called Pahrump. It originally had a series of artesian wells, 
had lots of water, and for many years they farmed cotton. But it has 
now become a retirement and business community with golf courses there. 
It is a beautiful community less than an hour from Las Vegas.

Last night a man who had just returned from Afghanistan--his name is 
Ian Deutch. It was his second day on the job as a police officer. He 
was murdered by a man who had a domestic dispute with a woman, and he 
was proceeding to a place of business with lots and lots of people when 
he shot Officer Deutch.

The officer who was with him, Thomas Klenczar, killed the gunman 
saving untold lives. This is a tragic story. The slain man had a 
teenage child, a 7-year-old, and just returned, as I have indicated, 
from Afghanistan in our military. It was his second day on the job--not 
killed in Afghanistan, not wounded in Afghanistan, killed in Pahrump, 
NV.

This is the way peace officers find themselves all over America every 
day protecting us from these criminals and crazed people. I express my 
condolences to the entire Nye County Sheriff's Department and 
especially to Sheriff Anthony DeMeo and especially to the family of Ian 
Deutch.
