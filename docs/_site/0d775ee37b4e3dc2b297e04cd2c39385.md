Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dr. 
Frederick Marciano, Scottsdale Healthcare's ''Salute to Military'' 
Honoree this Memorial Day, May 26, 2008. Scottsdale Healthcare will be 
recognizing Dr. Marciano and other physicians with a connection to the 
Armed Services for their tireless service and sacrifice to this 
country.

More than 300 medical personnel have received exceptional trauma 
skill training at Scottsdale Healthcare since the program's 
inauguration in 2004. The program is offered in partnership with 
Maricopa Integrated Health System and has focused on the Air National 
Guard, Luke Air Force Base, and Davis Monthan Air Force Base.

I commend Scottsdale Healthcare for paying tribute to such a 
deserving service member. Dr. Frederick Marciano is the Medical 
Director of Neurology at Scottsdale Healthcare, and was mobilized in 
April as a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves to Active Duty 
at William Beaumont Army Medical Center in Fort Bliss, Texas. His 
clinical areas of expertise include neurotrauma, general neurosurgery, 
spinal surgery, and brain and spinal tumor surgery.

Dr. Marciano was also deployed in March 2003 to a Landstuhl Regional 
Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, where he treated casualties from 
military operations including Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom 
(Afghanistan), and Noble Eagle (Bosnia). Notably, he was the lead 
surgeon in the treatment of POW Private First Class Jessica Lynch's 
spinal and neurological injuries.

Dr. Marciano has received the National Defense Service Medal twice, 
the U.S. Armed Forces Reserves Medal, the U.S. Army Service Ribbon, the 
U.S. Army Achievement Medal twice, the Overseas Service Ribbon, and the 
Superior Unit Award (Landstuhl).

Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing Dr. Frederick Marciano's 
continued dedication to saving lives and securing our freedom.
