`Mr. KYL â€” 2 August 2007`

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment simply has us do something we 
have already done. We passed, I believe, unanimously some provisions to 
help small businesses pay for the minimum wage increase. We all did 
that. The bill went over to the House of Representatives. You will 
recall they attached the minimum wage bill to the Iraq supplemental, 
and they dropped out these tax provisions.

This amendment simply reinstates the same tax provisions for small 
businesses in three areas: leasehold and restaurant depreciation, 
extending them from the end of this year through 2008; new restaurant 
construction, a 15-year depreciation period; owner-occupied retail, a 
15-year depreciation period--all just through the end of the year 2008.

As to the first one, it has to be done this year because it expires 
at the end of this year. As I said, we adopted this. We checked the 
record. I think it was by unanimous consent. In any event, I believe it 
was unanimous. We already passed it.

Here is the irony. The underlying bill that the SCHIP bill has been 
attached to is that minimum wage bill. So to the argument that this is 
not the right bill, I would say, actually, this is not the right bill 
for SCHIP, but it is the right bill for this amendment. So I hope we 
can repeat what we have already done and adopt this small business 
relief.
