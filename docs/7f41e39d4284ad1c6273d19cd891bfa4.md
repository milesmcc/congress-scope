Mr. PERRIELLO. Madam Speaker, on April 2nd, 2009, I voted against H. 
Con. Res. 85, the Congressional Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2010. 
Although I was unable to cast my vote on the resolution, I made it 
clear to Leadership that I continue to oppose the budget resolution. 
While this budget represents much-needed honesty by including the cost 
of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the inevitable cost 
associated with natural disasters, it does not go far enough to restore 
fiscal responsibility to our Nation. We are suffering in the wake of 
eight years of historic fiscal irresponsibility. But difficult times 
call for difficult decisions. We cannot climb out of the current 
economic crisis without returning to fiscal sanity to restore consumer 
and investor confidence. While this budget resolution took a 
significant step in the right direction by cutting the deficit by more 
than half in five years, we can and must do better. For this reason, I 
continue to oppose the budget resolution.
