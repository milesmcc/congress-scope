Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor 
the service and mourn the death of Marine Lance Corporal Frederik E. 
Vazquez, of Melrose Park, IL. He was killed Saturday in Helmand 
Province in Afghanistan while supporting combat operations. He was just 
20 years old.

Erik to his family and Freddy to his friends, Frederik Vazquez was 
born in Los Angeles, spent his childhood in Northlake and moved to 
Melrose Park just a few years ago, where he attended Proviso West High 
School before graduating from West Leyden in 2008.

Erik had wanted to be a Marine since childhood, and enlisted 
following graduation. His parents remembered a quiet young man who 
returned from Marine boot camp more reflective and responsible, with an 
eye toward college after the Marines. I join with those who knew Erik 
best in mourning the life he lost, and that which could have been.

I extend my heartfelt condolences to Erik's friends, family, and 
everyone who will miss this young Marine. On behalf of this Congress 
and the 5th District of Illinois I thank him for his bravery. His 
country will never forget his service.
