# NATIONAL NURSES WEEK

`Mr. TERRY â€” 6 May 2008`

Mr. TERRY. I yield myself as much time as I may consume.

I rise today in support of House Resolution 1086, acknowledging May 6 
through May 12, 2008, as National Nurses Week. In addition to kicking 
off National Nurses Week today, we are also celebrating the comforts 
and care that nurses provide by recognizing May 6 as National Nurses 
Day. This tradition started in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan signed 
a proclamation making today National Recognition Day for Nurses.

This is a week to recognize nurses as being the largest single 
component of the health care profession with over 2.5 million 
registered nurses in the United States and the critical role they play 
in providing care to not only the citizens of America but are also 
serving our Nation in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition to the 
immediate care they provide to patients, they also have helped to 
educate, inform and improve education and retention of nurses.

I would like to thank the author of this resolution, Ms. Eddie 
Bernice Johnson of Texas, for her leadership in honoring nurses that 
have helped promote health, prevent disease and help other Americans 
cope with illness. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of 
this resolution.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
