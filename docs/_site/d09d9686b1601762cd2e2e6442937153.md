# UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1585

`Mr. REID â€” 27 June 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say this: The labor provisions about 
which the distinguished Senator talked, we have agreed to take care of 
those. Everybody knows that. Maybe my friend doesn't, but we certainly 
have conveyed this to the minority in great detail. I would simply say, 
if it is not this, then what is it? We have agreed to handle the labor 
situation in this bill. The Speaker and I have agreed, and I don't know 
what other assurance anyone could give.

This is really stunning to me, that on the Defense authorization bill 
I am


going to have to file cloture--Defense authorization bill--a motion to 
proceed to it. We have already filed--I don't know the exact number, I 
lose track of it, but 12 to 14 motions, clotures on motions to proceed, 
far more than were done in the last Congress just in this little period 
of time we have been here. Why? Because everything we move to, there is 
an objection.

Keep in mind what this is. It is the Defense authorization bill, a 
bill we have to pass to take care of our troops in Iraq, in 
Afghanistan, in Korea, in Germany, and troops here at home. It is for 
training. It has a pay raise in it. It is a good piece of legislation 
worked on by Senator Warner and Senator Levin. It is a bipartisan bill, 
and I just think everyone who is listening to these proceedings, 
wherever they might be, should understand the Republicans are objecting 
to going to the bill to fund our troops.
