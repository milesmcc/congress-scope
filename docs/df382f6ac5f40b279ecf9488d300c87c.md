Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House 
Resolution 1086, recognizing National Nurses Week, which is May 6 
through May 12 of this year. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. 
I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice 
Johnson)--Nurse Johnson--for advancing this legislation to help educate 
the American people about the critical role that nurses play in health 
care delivery.

With May 12 being the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder 
of modern nursing, there is not a more appropriate time to celebrate 
the work done by nurses. As an OB-GYN physician for almost 30 years, I 
was fortunate to work with intelligent, hardworking, compassionate 
nurses, and they were indeed a cornerstone of the high quality health 
care we provided.

Madam Speaker, nurses are on the front lines of health care delivery 
not only here at home but also in Iraq and Afghanistan. Therefore, 
because we are relying on our nurses so heavily and because we 
currently are experiencing a shortage of nurses, it is critical to 
support nurse training programs. That is why I recently joined with a 
number of my colleagues in supporting title VIII funding to provide 
loans and grants to our Nation's nursing students.

I urge all my colleagues to support the goals of National Nurses 
Week.
