Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, when President Bush vetoed a bill earlier 
this month that would provide health care coverage to 10 million 
American children, he said the spending was excessive. The bipartisan 
bill invested $35 billion more in children's health over a 5-year 
period. Three weeks later, President Bush announces that he needs $196 
billion to fight the war in Iraq over the next year. If $35 billion for 
children's health is excessive, what exactly is his request for the 
war?

I know the President believes that Congress is his personal ATM 
machine, but article I of the Constitution says different, and we will 
not rubber-stamp his funding request for the war.

As we have in the past, Democrats will continue to exert pressure on 
the administration to change course in Iraq so that we can begin to 
bring the


troops home. There is no military solution to the war; yet the Bush 
administration refuses to put pressure on the Iraqi Government to enact 
the political reforms that are necessary to bring about stability in 
the country.

While we push the administration to change course in Iraq, we also 
remain firm in our conviction to pass the children's health care bill 
that covers 10 million American children.
