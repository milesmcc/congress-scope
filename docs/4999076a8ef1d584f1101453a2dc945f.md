`Mr. BINGAMAN â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in October 2002, this Chamber gathered 
to consider one of the most serious decisions I have been involved in 
confronting in the 25 years I have been in the Senate. That was a 
decision on whether to grant President Bush authority to invade Iraq. 
At that time, nearly 5 years ago, I opposed the invasion of Iraq, 
believing that it was necessary to give the United Nations weapons 
inspectors the time they needed to determine whether Iraq did, in fact, 
possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. I believe that we 
needed to gather the facts and we needed to make an informed decision 
as to whether Iraq posed such a terrible and immediate threat to our 
country that regime change was warranted. As we all know now, the 
weapons of mass destruction were nowhere to be found.

Unfortunately, the weapons of mass destruction were not the only 
thing the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, and 
other members of the administration were wrong about when it came to 
beginning this war. They were also wrong in thinking that we could 
succeed in Iraq without substantial help from our allies. They were 
wrong to reject warnings that the invasion would fracture Iraq's 
delicate sectarian balance. They were wrong to dismiss legitimate 
questions about how we would rebuild Iraq's civil society. They were 
wrong to think that Iraq's neighbors, Iran and Saudi Arabia, in 
particular, would ignore their opportunity to fill a regional power 
vacuum after the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime. They were wrong 
to promise the American people, as Secretary Rumsfeld's assistant, Ken 
Adelman, did, that Iraq would be a ''cakewalk.''

My statement at that time, nearly 5 years ago, was the following:




 If war must be waged, other countries should be there with 


 us sharing the costs and helping to restore stability in what 


 will almost certainly be the tumultuous aftermath of military 


 action.


Mr. President, ''tumultuous'' only begins to describe the calamity we 
face in Iraq today. Almost 5 years have passed since that October day. 
Five years is longer than it took Presidents Roosevelt and Truman to 
defeat the Axis Powers in World War II.

Today, Iraq is diverting the United States from other very important 
foreign policy matters. First, of course, it is diverting us from the 
fight against terrorist networks worldwide. Second, it is diverting us 
from responding to the rise of China as a world power. Third, it is 
diverting us from reducing our dependence upon fossil fuels and 
particularly lessening our dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
Fourth, it is diverting us from keeping our country economically 
competitive during this era of globalization.

Respect for America around the world has eroded dramatically as a 
result of this war. To many around the world, the symbol of our country 
today is no longer the Statue of Liberty; instead, it is Abu Ghraib.

President Bush and Vice President Cheney often tell us that we are in 
Iraq to fight the terrorists who attacked us on September 11.

In his 2003 State of the Union speech, the President told us that 
Saddam ''aids and protects'' terrorists, including members of al-Qaida.

In 2004, the Vice President promised ''ample evidence confirming the 
link . . . between al-Qaida and the Iraqi intelligence services.''

In 2005, the President said:




 They are trying to shake our will in Iraq, just as they 


 tried to shake our will on September 11.


In March, Vice President Cheney said:




 Iraq's relevance to the war on terror simply could not be 


 more plain. . . . As we get farther away from 9/11, I believe 


 there is a temptation to forget the urgency of the task that 


 came to us that day.


Just last week, as many speakers have reiterated, President Bush 
said:




 The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq 


 were the ones who attacked us in America on September 11th.


So the administration has been consistent in its formulation of this 
problem. The truth is, Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11. He 
did not support al-Qaida before September 11, and al-Qaida had no 
presence in Iraq prior to that date. Saddam Hussein was a brutal 
dictator, but his regime posed little immediate threat to the United 
States or its allies. The Baath party, as a secular Arab nationalist 
movement, had no history of cooperation with al-Qaida or other Islamist 
movements.


The truth is that al-Qaida's offshoot, al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, is in 
Iraq today because of our decision to invade. As the Washington Post 
pointed out recently, al-Qaida in Mesopotamia is an Iraqi phenomenon. 
Its membership is largely Iraqi. It derives its primary financing 
indigenously from kidnappings and other criminal activities. And those 
terrorists and would-be terrorists who have come to Iraq from other 
countries would not have been there absent this conflict.

Al-Qaida in Mesopotamia thrives over Sunni grievances over our 
occupation of that country. Our continued occupation of that country is 
its best recruiting tool.

President Bush has treated terrorism as a monolith. As David 
Kilcullen, a counterterrorism analyst, has written, the President has 
lumped together all terrorism, all rogue states, all strategic 
competitors.

Lumping every dangerous terrorist movement together profoundly 
misconstrues the nature of terrorism and, in fact, encourages eclectic 
groups to collaborate. It places our Nation in greater jeopardy, not 
less jeopardy.

So the question today is, where do we go from here?

The fundamental problem in Iraq today is not a lack of U.S. troops; 
it is an absence of national reconciliation. The U.S. role in Iraq 
should not be to police an endless civil war. Rather, it should be to 
facilitate a settlement among the parties themselves.

The President has belatedly realized that we did not marshal enough 
troops to stabilize Iraq following our invasion in 2002. But today, 
merely adding troops is not the solution. The administration's ongoing 
troop surge is unlikely to prove effective absent a broader political 
settlement.

If current trends continue, our policy will be, de facto, one of 
siding with the Shia over the Sunnis. The Shia-led government knows 
this. It has, therefore, played for time by clinging to the status quo, 
by dragging its feet on national reconciliation. The Shia-led 
government has shown little sign that it appreciates the need for 
accommodation of national minorities. It has missed the most important 
milestones that have been identified by the Iraq Study Group and by 
this Congress.

The administration's own benchmark report released several days ago 
reports unsatisfactory progress on debaathification, on passage of an 
oil law, on holding provincial elections, on disarming militias. The 
Iraqi Constitutional Review Commission has failed to make adequate 
progress.



There has been progress on other benchmarks. I welcome that progress. 
But these were second-order issues compared to the challenge of 
national reconciliation. And the bloodshed continues.

Going forward we need to focus on two objectives.

First, we need to send the Iraqi ruling elite a crisp and credible 
signal that our commitment to maintaining forces in that country is not 
unconditional. Only by making this point loud and clear do we create 
the possibility that the Shia-led government will take the painful 
steps necessary toward national reconciliation.

The U.S. has a moral responsibility to do what it can to create a 
degree of political stability in Iraq. But I repeat the key phrase in 
that sentence, ''do what we can,'' for we can do no more.

Our commitment to Iraq is not openended. We cannot impose a political 
settlement without the cooperation of the political elites in the 
country. The Iraqis themselves must want a solution.

Second, we need to draw down U.S. troop presence in a responsible 
way. Too precipitous a withdrawal will undermine the credibility of 
America's commitment to facilitating a political settlement in the 
country. We need to provide a carrot by allowing for the continued 
presence of U.S. forces in a peacekeeping capacity if the Iraqi 
Government does bring about some measure of national reconciliation.

It is because of these two principles that I supported the first 
supplemental appropriation this spring. That legislation set a firm 
date for beginning withdrawal. That was the stick.

It set a date for completing withdrawal. This arrangement left open 
the possibility of leaving some U.S. peacekeepers in Iraq if, 
ultimately, the factions forged a political settlement. That was the 
carrot.

This approach remains sound today. And today, with these objectives, 
in mind, I would urge five steps that we must take in Iraq.

First, we need to announce a firm deadline to begin a drawdown of 
U.S. troops from Iraq.

The credible threat of a withdrawal, perhaps more than withdrawal 
itself, may convince the Iraqi ruling elite of the need to accommodate 
national minorities. The mere threat of a withdrawal says that our 
commitment to Iraq is not unconditional. It proclaims that we will not 
preserve the failed status quo.

I applaud my colleagues, such as Senator Levin, Senator Reed and 
Senator Feingold, for fighting for a firm deadline. They may disagree 
on the specifics of withdrawal.

But they do agree that if they do not continue to push for a firm 
timetable, the Bush administration will cling to that failed status 
quo.

The fact that the administration is even considering alternatives is 
a direct result of our decision to push for some change in direction by 
a specific date.

Second, we must form a multinational working group to discuss the way 
forward in Iraq.

It is crucial for Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey to be involved. They 
have historical and religious links to national minorities in Iraq. 
They have the most to lose by continued instability there. We cannot 
achieve any political settlement in Iraq without their active 
participation.

Third, this group--not the Iraqi Government--should convene a Dayton-
style multinational conference to help Iraq's factions forge a 
political settlement.

Fourth, such a settlement would provide for a negotiated withdrawal 
of U.S. combat troops, as the Iraq Study Group prescribes. If 
appropriate, other U.S. troops could stay, ideally as part of a 
multinational or U.N. peacekeeping force.

Finally, we should implement the other recommendations of the Iraq 
Study Group, including using our good offices to mediate other 
conflicts in the Middle East, including the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. President Bush should begin by appointing a special envoy to 
the region, and I applaud his announcement yesterday of a resumption in 
aid to West Bank Palestinians.

I conclude my remarks by saluting the servicemen of my home State who 
have given their lives while answering our Nation's call to duty in 
Iraq.

I have asked the Pentagon for an accounting of all New Mexican 
service personnel who have died in Iraq to this date, and that is the 
accounting I will go through at this time.

While the people of New Mexico and of our entire Nation mourn their 
loss, we will always celebrate the lives they led and the sacrifices 
they made for our country.
