Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 2,600 
men and women of the Minnesota National Guard who, after serving our 
country with great honor and courage, are returning home from their 16-
month deployment to Iraq.

Last Friday my friend and colleague, Congressman Tim Walz, and I had 
the privilege of visiting Volk Field near Fort McCoy in Wisconsin and 
welcoming home soldiers from the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry 
Division, the famed ''Red Bulls.'' It was truly a memorable experience 
greeting these proud soldiers as they returned from the longest combat 
deployment of any Army brigade combat team in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Minnesota's ''Red Bulls'' escorted supply convoys and traveled 2.4 
million miles in Iraq. Other members of the BCT provided essential 
security to U.S. bases throughout the country.

Speaking with the fine men and women of the ''Red Bulls'' as they 
stepped off the plane and smelled that clean, fresh air and stepped on 
American soil, it became clear that these soldiers are justifiably 
proud of their accomplishments. The great State of Minnesota and all 
Americans can be proud as well.
