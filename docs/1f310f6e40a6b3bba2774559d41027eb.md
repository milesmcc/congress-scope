Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, as we wind up this debate on escalating the 
war in Iraq, I wish to thank Speaker Pelosi for allowing Members of 
Congress to express themselves on the most serious debate that will 
occur in the 110th Congress. Perhaps more importantly, we should thank 
the American people for voting for a new majority which has allowed a 
free and open debate on the President's plan to escalate the war. With 
their votes, the American people have clearly demanded a new direction 
for the war in Iraq. Today's debate symbolizes more than just a debate 
on escalating the war, the debate symbolizes a new direction for 
America's policy in Iraq driven by the American people, not by a 
President who has lost touch.

In October of 2002, just before the general election, President Bush 
insisted a vote be held on Resolution 114 which would allow the use of 
Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and 
appropriate in Iraq. At that time, I argued that the United States did 
not have the moral, legal and ethical authority to go to war with Iraq 
and that our Nation would lose its moral authority to speak out against 
aggression throughout the world.

It would be very easy for me to stand here and remind my constituents 
that I voted against the war in Iraq. It is sufficient, however, to 
simply note that the evidence to justify the war has been repudiated. 
Rationale for this war has been inadequate. And our Nation's 
credibility has been eroded.

While some of us opposed the war in Iraq, our support for our troops 
has never wavered. Congress has appropriated the supplies and the 
resources to assure that our troops have what they need to accomplish 
their mission and return home safely. We know too painfully that more 
than 3,100 Americans have not returned home and more than 23,000 have 
been wounded. We have visited with the wounded and comforted the 
families of the fallen. We simply cannot allow the President to 
continue to fight this war as if there were no consequences for our 
troops, their families and our country. By standing up against this 
escalation of the war, we are supporting the troops.

Because of this war, many lives have been shattered and broken. I 
speak of the lives of family members who have lost loved ones. I speak 
of the brave troops recovering from their wounds at Walter Reed Army 
Hospital or the recently dedicated amputee clinic in Texas. As a 
Nation, we are comprised of a reasonable, noble, compassionate and 
determined people.

I believe that it is not in our Nation's best interest to leave a 
shattered and broken Iraq behind. Still, we cannot continue with a 
policy of military might and no diplomatic foresight. Instead of 
military escalation, our Nation should embark upon a diplomatic and 
political escalation. The current administration with its ''military 
might makes right'' philosophy is no longer applicable in Iraq. This 
administration has not seriously focused on the diplomacy and political 
persuasion necessary to end this war.

I am struck by the recent news out of Korea. It is reported that 
after years of negotiation, the administration may have reached an 
agreement with North Korea on its nuclear threat. The journey was long, 
discussions were difficult, diplomacy was frustrating, but we may have 
accomplished our goal without having to go to war. There is a lesson to 
be learned here, reflected in the words of an American journalist, Anne 
O'Hare McCormick, who said:

''Today the real test of power is not the capacity to make war but 
the capacity to prevent it.''

I call on the Bush administration and this Congress to escalate 
diplomacy. I call on the Bush administration and this Congress to 
escalate political pressure. This war is a mistake and what we need now 
is a President who has the courage to admit his mistake. We need a 
President who will bring peace and stability to Iraq through diplomacy 
rather than military force.

In an earlier time, in an earlier war, a young man spoke out. That 
young man was Bobby Kennedy and his words have lived with me for many 
years. So to our service men and women, to my colleagues in the U.S. 
House of Representatives, and to those whose hearts are burdened by 
war, I leave you Bobby's challenge:

''Diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped 
each time a man stands up for an ideal or strikes out against 
injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each 
other from a million different centers of energy and daring those 
ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest wall.''

Our vote for this resolution will not stop the war in Iraq. It will 
not restore the shattered and broken lives here in America and in Iraq. 
It will not bring peace and stability to Iraq. But it will send a tiny 
ripple of hope.

I still believe in that tiny ripple of hope.

I still believe in diverse acts of courage.

I still believe in the greatness of America.
