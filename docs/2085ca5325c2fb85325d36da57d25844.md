Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Army SPC 
Armer Nathan


Burkart, who died of injuries sustained in Baghdad, Iraq, on May 11, 
2006.

Specialist Burkart was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 71st Cavalry 
Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, with which he served in Afghanistan 
and Iraq. As a high school student in Derwood, Maryland, Specialist 
Burkart participated in ROTC. He attended Lehigh University on an ROTC 
scholarship before enlisting with the United States Army in July 2000.

Specialist Burkart always dreamed of a career in the military, 
following in the footsteps of his two grandfathers, who were both 
retired Navy captains. He was a devoted husband to his wife, Christy, 
and a fine soldier.

It is with the utmost gratitude that I recognize Specialist Burkart's 
heroic service to our Nation.
