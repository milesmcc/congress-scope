Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the bill, H.R. 1402, the Sergeant Dennis J. Flanagan Lecanto 
Post Office Building piece of legislation. It will rename the South 
Lecanto Highway Post Office in Lecanto, Florida, after Army Sergeant 
Flanagan, who was killed by terrorist insurgents in 2006 while on 
patrol in Iraq.

I actually attended the services out at Arlington Cemetery. I was 
with the family. I also attended the service for the young man that was 
held in Citrus County.

In my district office, I have a photograph that his mom gave me that 
was taken at the service. And it appears as if there is this rainbow 
over the marker. It is truly a tribute to this 2001 graduate of Lecanto 
High School because Sergeant Flanagan was an active member of the 
Junior ROTC, and he achieved the rank of lieutenant in his first year.

Within a week following the attacks of September 11, 2001, on our 
country, he enlisted in the Army and began his first tour of duty in 
Iraq. Sergeant Flanagan then re-enlisted for a second tour in Iraq in 
September of 2005. Tragically, he was killed, along with three other 
U.S. soldiers, when an IED hit a Humvee in which he was traveling. Only 
the Humvee driver survived the incident.
