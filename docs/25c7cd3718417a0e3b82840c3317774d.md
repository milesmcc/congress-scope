Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 601, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 3159) to mandate minimum periods of rest and 
recuperation for units and members of the regular and reserve 
components of the Armed Forces between deployments for Operation Iraqi 
Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom, and ask for its immediate 
consideration.
