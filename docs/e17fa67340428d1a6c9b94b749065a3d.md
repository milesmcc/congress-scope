`Mr. BEGICH â€” 8 June 2010`

Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, the English author Albert Pine wrote: 
''What we have done for ourselves alone, dies with us; what we have 
done for others and the world remains and is immortal.'' On Memorial 
Day we come together to recognize and honor those who have truly ''done 
for others and the world'' and to ensure their service and sacrifice 
remains immortal.

Each year since 1868 we have paused to pay tribute to those who have 
made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom and democracy. This freedom 
we cherish is not free and comes at a horrific price, a price borne by 
our veterans, both past and present. Our veterans never fought for 
empires or dominance but, rather, for a cause bigger than any one 
individual. That cause is freedom and democracy, something many of them 
would sadly never live to see.

There is no greater service to one's country and no greater act of 
heroism than to stand between our Nation and those who would do us 
harm. So it is today, Memorial Day 2010, we again come together as a 
nation recognizing and honoring the valor and courage of the men and 
women who have given so much--warriors who paved the road of freedom 
with their service and sacrifices.

Alaska has a proud tradition of military service. During World War 
II, long before Alaska's statehood, the Alaska Territorial Guard 
stepped up and played a key role in defending Alaska and protecting 
America's interests. Today Alaska is home to more than 28,000 Active-
Duty men and women, many of whom have served multiple tours of duty in 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Alaska Army and Air National 
Guard is also playing a key role in these conflicts by deploying 
hundreds of Alaskans to combat duty.

It is all of our Active-Duty men and women--and their families--whom 
we should also thank and honor today. To the veterans among us--thank 
you for your service. We also remember warriors still missing and 
unaccounted for and continue our commitment to provide the fullest 
possible accounting and to return them home.
