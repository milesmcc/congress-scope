Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I am here offering an amendment in the 
Defense reauthorization bill for 2011 because of some of the treatment 
that Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, Nevada, Maryland, and 
Vermont Guardsmen may have received when they got back from tours in 
Iraq and Afghanistan this spring.

The National Guard and the Army have been fighting side-by-side 
through nearly 9 years of war. It is time to make a full assessment of 
the treatment our National Guard soldiers receive when they get home.

My first amendment directs the Department of Defense Inspector 
General to report back to Congress by the end of the year on the 
treatment and medical care our National Guard soldiers receive in 
comparison to regular Army.

The second amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to provide 
each member of the National Guard with a clear and comprehensive 
statement of the medical care and treatment they are entitled to 
receive. When they are in theater, the Army makes no distinction 
between the National Guard, Army Reserves, and regular Army soldiers. 
There should be no distinction in the care when they return home.

I ask the House to continue this work by supporting my amendments.
