`Mr. McKEON â€” 25 June 2009`

Mr. McKEON. I think Mr. Hunter just stated it very clearly. The exit 
strategy should be to win, and then bring our forces home. It was 
stated earlier that General Petraeus made a statement that Afghanistan 
has been known over the years as a graveyard of empires, and we cannot 
take that history lightly. That was part of a speech that he gave.

I would like to say some other things that he mentioned in that 
speech:

''We have a hugely important interest in ensuring that Afghanistan 
does not once again become a sanctuary for transnational terrorists. 
And to complement and capitalize on the increased military resources, 
more civilian assets, adequate financial resources, close civil-
military cooperation and a comprehensive approach that encompasses 
regional states will be necessary. Our objectives are of enormous 
importance. We all need to summon the will and the resources necessary 
to make the most of it.''

It was just a couple of years ago when we were having a similar 
debate when we were being told by some that we needed to get out of 
Iraq, that there was no way we could win, and General Petraeus was 
called to lead the surge. And now he is telling us how we can win in 
Afghanistan. Mr. Chairman, I think now is not time to be retreating. 
Now is not the time when we're sending 20,000 troops and are ready to 
embark on this surge to win, to help the people of Afghanistan and 
preserve our national interests there. Now is the time to let the 
forces know that we support them. We support their mission. We want 
them to be successful and return home safely.

I yield back the balance of my time.
