Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I 
rise in support of the amendment.

It is time to give the best fighting men and women in the world the 
policy that they deserve instead of the failed policy we have thrust 
them in the middle of.

After years of a blank check, the House of Representatives is finally 
representing the American people. They have told us to fund these 
troops, and we do in this bill. But they told us to make the Iraqis 
stand up and negotiate an end to their civil war, and this bill has in 
it the benchmarks and the leverage necessary to do that.

We have sent the best men and women in the world to execute the worst 
policy in the world, and finally this House of Representatives is 
representing the will of the American people. They say fund the troops, 
and we do. They say change the policy, and we do. And they say let the 
Iraqis take responsibility for ending their own civil war, and we do.

This is a policy as good as the men and women who are doing the 
fighting.
