Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the Internet has been a 
profound tool and resource of advanced knowledge to connect families 
and friends around the world. Internet users and providers have 
improved upon and utilized a free marketplace. However, there is a real 
concern that the new proposed ''net neutrality'' regulations may 
undermine or stifle innovation.

There is a time and a place for government to promote transparency in 
the pursuit of good business practices. However, the government and 
bureaucratic agencies should not needlessly impose regulations when the 
cause for concern is not justified. Before we move forward with new 
regulations on the Internet, we must weigh the consequences. We need to 
ensure we do not disrupt the necessary flexibility that has led to a 
vibrant marketplace, one which continues to foster new technology 
around the world, helping liberate people of Afghanistan, Iraq, and 
Iran.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
