Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, this morning I was honored to join with 
Senator McCain and other Republican and Democratic Members of both the 
House and Senate to welcome over 400 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan 
that were here for a rally in support of all those who are risking 
their lives on the front lines in this global war against terror.

This morning's rally marks the single largest gathering of Iraq and 
Afghan veterans since the war began. Make no mistake, these heroes were 
gathering in support of victory, not a politically driven withdrawal, 
which would ensure defeat.

These veterans are so committed to success in Iraq and Afghanistan 
that they have formed a nationwide group, called Vets for Freedom, with 
a mission of educating the American public and Congress about the 
importance of achieving success in this global war on terror and what 
the failure to do so would mean for our Nation's security.

Every Member of this body should, this week, meet with these 
veterans, talk to them, learn of the benefits of their firsthand 
experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the words of the Vets for 
Freedom, it is time to put ''long-term national security before short-
term partisan political gain.''

Again, I thank the Vets for Freedom, as well as General Petraeus and 
Ambassador Crocker, for their great service to this country.
