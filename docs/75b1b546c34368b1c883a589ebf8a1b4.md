# OUR TROOPS NEED FULL FUNDING

Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, the Senate gave overwhelming 
unanimous consent for General Petraeus to implement his strategy in 
Iraq. We all agree, on both sides of the aisle, he is the best we have. 
In fact, he has written a manual dealing with terrorists.

So why do the Democrats want to withdraw funds to support him 
starting the first of July? Even as we speak, the troops have to 
reallocate funds and prioritize their missions, because they don't have 
the full funding. In fact, they will run out of money shortly. So why 
do the Democrats not allow General Petraeus to do his job? General 
Petraeus intends to report back in September with a complete report on 
how we are doing. That is a very short amount of time, in fact, 5 
months away.

He deserves a chance, and he deserves full funding for this Congress 
through the fiscal year 2007. So I urge Congress, after the President 
vetoes this bill, to come back and give a clean bill so that the 
President can get full funding for our troops, at least through fiscal 
year 2007.
