Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Kagan concludes:




 Any plan that requires a withdrawal based on a timeline, 


 rather than conditions on the ground, is likely to lead to 


 failure. The notion that imposing timelines would somehow 


 force the Iraqi government to ''do the right thing'' and 


 thereby resolve the problems in the country is always 


 presented without any evidence. It is the logical argument 


 without substantiation that appears to be contradicted by 


 past precedent and by facts on the ground. It is a mirage 


 that some people cling to as a way of convincing themselves 


 and others that an action likely to lead to complete failure 


 in Iraq will instead lead to at least partial success. As the 


 president and Congress deliberate on the best way ahead for 


 the United States and Iraq, therefore, the choices are quite 


 stark. Either the United States can continue its efforts to 


 establish security while improving the capabilities of the 


 ISF or it can abandon those efforts, withdraw, and allow Iraq 


 to sink into chaos where terrorists can flourish.


I urge all Members of the Senate to pay attention to the wisdom of 
Mr. Kagan's report.
