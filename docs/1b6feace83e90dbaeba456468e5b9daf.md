Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.

Mr. Chairman, President Obama on a recent ''60 Minutes'' interview 
said he favors an exit strategy. This shouldn't be controversial. We 
are told that there's a political solution ultimately to be had in 
Afghanistan. All we are asking is: When does our military contribution 
to that political solution come to an end so that we know when we can 
think about bringing our troops back home?

That's all this amendment does. This should not be controversial at 
all. What we are asking is simply a clearly defined mission, and 
nothing more.

At this point, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to yield 2 minutes to a 
cosponsor of this amendment, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).
