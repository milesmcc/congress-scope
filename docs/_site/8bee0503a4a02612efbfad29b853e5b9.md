Mr. ELLSWORTH. Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness and deep 
respect that I


rise today to honor the life of Staff Sergeant Keith Matthew (Matt) 
Maupin.

Matt Maupin's story has gripped the hearts of thousands of Americans 
across the country since the 20-year-old Army reservist was captured in 
Iraq in 2004. Together, we have hoped and prayed for four long years 
that he would be returned home safely to his family. Sadly, those 
prayers went unanswered.

Matt Maupin was laid to rest in Cincinnati on Sunday, having given 
the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. But the most 
significant thing about Matt Maupin isn't how he died, it's how he 
lived.

Matt is a beloved son to Keith and Carolyn and brother to Micah, 
Stephen, and Lee Ann. A native son of Batavia, Ohio, he understood 
there is no higher calling than service to others and bravely stepped 
forward to serve his country in the Army reserve. Matt Maupin is a true 
American hero.

On behalf of the people of the 8th District of Indiana, I want to 
extend my deepest condolences to his family and friends who love and 
miss him today. May God bless Matt, his family, and all of those who 
continue to sacrifice so much for our country.
