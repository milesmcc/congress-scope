Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to Army 
Ranger Christopher Wright, from Tollesboro, Kentucky, who lost his life 
on August 19, 2010 from wounds sustained when insurgents attacked his 
unit with small arms fire in the Konar Province of Afghanistan.

He was assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, 
Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia.

Specialist Wright was a 2005 graduate of Lewis County High School and 
was on his second tour of duty overseas.



He was the beloved son of James Cochran and Linda Dennis. He also was 
a role model for his three younger siblings.

Today, as we celebrate the life and accomplishments of this 
exceptional Kentuckian, my thoughts and prayers are with Specialist 
Wright's family and friends.

We are all deeply indebted to Specialist Wright for his service and 
his sacrifice.
