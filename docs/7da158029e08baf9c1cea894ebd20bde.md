Mr. PENCE. As we've heard this morning, Madam Speaker, 4 years ago 
today, aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, President Bush gave a speech. 
Now, it has been characterized by Members of Congress this morning that 
the President ''announced 'mission accomplished.' '' And one other 
speaker said that the President ''declared 'mission accomplished.' '' 
Actually, here's what the President said, and I am quoting: ''We have 
difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order to parts of the 
country that remain dangerous.'' But he added, ''our mission continues. 
Al Qaeda is wounded, not destroyed. The enemies of freedom are not idle 
and neither are we, and we will continue to hunt down the enemy before 
he can strike.''

The President said, ''the battle of Iraq is one victory in a war of 
terror that began September 11 and still goes on.''

As the President said 4 years ago, Madam Speaker, ''our mission is 
not accomplished in Iraq or in the war on terror.'' So now is not the 
time to tie the funding for our troops to deadlines and defeat. Now is 
not the time for politicians in Washington, D.C. to micromanage and 
make decisions for our commanders in the field.

Mr. President, veto this bill.
