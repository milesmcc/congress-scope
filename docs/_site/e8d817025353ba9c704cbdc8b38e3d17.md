`Mr. CORNYN â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. CORNYN. I yield myself 4 minutes.

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the distinguished 
majority whip, the Senator from Illinois, but I do see things a little 
differently.

First of all, when he talks about a civil war in Iraq, he seems to 
overlook the fact that al-Qaida is present in Iraq and is the 
precipitating cause for the sectarian strife we are all concerned 
about. What would he do to deal with al-Qaida in Iraq, which they 
regard as the central front in their war against the West?

When my friend from Illinois says we need a limited presence of our 
American troops in Iraq, I am not sure what that means, but I sure 
would rather have the four star Army GEN David Petraeus determining the 
appropriate tactics to deal with the threat on the ground rather than 
politicians, armchair generals here in Washington, DC.
