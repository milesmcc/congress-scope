`Ms. SCHWARTZ â€” 2 October 2007`

Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, after all the loss of life, personal 
sacrifice and billions of taxpayer dollars, the President still does 
not have a plan for securing the peace in Iraq and bringing our troops 
home.

After the continued failure of the Iraqi Government to make progress 
on political, social and economic benchmarks, the President chooses to 
stay the course in Iraq. After nearly 4/1/2/ years, Iraq remains 
politically unstable and tragically violent.

Instead of changing course and offering a viable plan to conclude 
America's military involvement, the President calls for an open-ended 
commitment to keeping our troops in Iraq for years to come. It is time 
to demand a new direction for Iraq, to focus our military on combating 
and defeating terrorism, to insist on a comprehensive diplomatic 
strategy to move the Iraqi Government toward national reconciliation, 
and to bring our troops home.

This Congress stands by our troops. They've performed with great 
honor and they've accomplished all that we have asked them to do. It is 
time to bring them home.

Vote ''yes'' to demand a redeployment plan. Vote ''yes'' to demand 
accountability from this President to bring our troops home from Iraq 
safely and responsibly.
