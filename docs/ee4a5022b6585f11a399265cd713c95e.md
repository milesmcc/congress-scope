Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of America's 
bravest, Sergeant David Robinson of Fort Smith, Arkansas, who valiantly 
sacrificed his life in support of combat missions in Afghanistan.

Service runs in Sergeant Robinson's family, with a grandfather who 
served as a sharpshooter in the military. So, when at a young age he 
told his mother he wanted to serve in the military, it was no surprise. 
He followed in his grandfather's footsteps, going into the artillery 
field when he joined the Army in 2004.

As a member of the 2nd Cavalry, he served as a gunner, a rifleman, 
and an ammunitions handler. At the young age of 25, he already had 
remarkable service to our Nation during his three tours: two in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom and one in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom.

My prayers and the prayers of Arkansans are with Sergeant Robinson's 
family, including his wife Heidi and three young children, Jerimy, 
Tyler, and Madison. I humbly offer my thanks to Sergeant David 
Robinson, a true American hero, for his selfless service to the 
security and well-being of Americans, and I ask my colleagues to keep 
his family in their thoughts and prayers during this very difficult 
time.
