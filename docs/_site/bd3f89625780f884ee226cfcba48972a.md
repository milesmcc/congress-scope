`Mr. BUCHANAN â€” 16 February 2007`

Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this 
resolution. I oppose the resolution not for what it says, but for what 
it does and what it will lead to.

As someone who enlisted at the age of 18 and spent 6 years as a 
member of the Air National Guard, I can tell you firsthand that this 
resolution will undermine our troops' morale and diminish their ability 
to accomplish their mission.

Passage of this resolution is also a first step towards cutting 
funding for our troops, and that is something that I absolutely cannot 
support.

Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq is an important part of the global war 
on terror. Failure in Iraq will go beyond being a disaster for American 
foreign policy. Failure would destabilize the country, destabilize the 
Middle East, and make America less safe.

The American people are well aware of al Qaeda's plans to turn Iraq 
into a staging area to spread global terrorism. Failure in Iraq would 
also result in diminished influence and credibility for America at a 
time when global alliances are critical to address threats from Iran 
and North Korea.

Mr. Speaker, this week I have been briefed by the U.S. intelligence 
officers, foreign ambassadors from the region, and I have reached out 
to many of my constituents, including Colonel John Saputo, who served 
in Iraq, and Colonel Lee Kitchen, who served in Vietnam. We all agree 
that although legitimate questions can be raised about whether this 
surge strategy will prove successful, the stakes are too high, the 
threats to America too great to walk away without giving our troops one 
last chance to restore order in Iraq. Passage of this resolution would 
deny our military leaders and our troops this one last opportunity.

Like all Americans, I want to bring our troops home safely, 
successfully and soon, but now is not the time for an immediate 
withdrawal. Now is the time to support our troops, support the values 
they fight for, and do everything possible to give them the best chance 
to succeed in their mission. This resolution does nothing to help in 
those efforts. In fact, it does the opposite. It is for this reason 
that I must oppose this resolution.
