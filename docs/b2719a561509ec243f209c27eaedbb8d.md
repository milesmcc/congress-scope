Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I am confused about why the hearing we 
had scheduled this afternoon cannot go forward. The subject matter of 
this hearing is oversight of the contract that is engaged in police 
training in Afghanistan in the Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight. 
This is a hearing that is getting to the heart of the matter; that we 
have a real problem with the mission part in Afghanistan on police 
training because of problems with these contracts--problems with 
oversight at the State Department.

We have now canceled the hearing because we have been told we can't 
have it. The witness from the State Department has been canceled, the 
witness from the Defense Department has been canceled, and the 
inspectors general who were coming to testify about a GAO report that 
just came out last week that was damning in its criticism in the 
oversight of these contracts.
