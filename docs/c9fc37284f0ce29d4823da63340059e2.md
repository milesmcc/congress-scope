Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me first thank Senator McCain for his 
great generosity in terms of his comments about the committee and the 
operations of our committee. As he well knows, our committee has had a 
great tradition of bipartisanship. He has made a major contribution, 
always, to that tradition. As ranking member, he has more than 
continued that tradition. He has made a major contribution to it and to 
the bill that is before us and to the bipartisan flavor of that bill.

While there obviously are and will be differences--which are 
understandable and appropriate--as he well points out, this is a bill 
that had unanimous support in the committee. We, in the next week or 
so, will be hearing differences on issues, including Iraq, and that is 
totally what we are all about: to express our feelings in a civil way 
and in a strong way.

But I add my thanks to him for his contribution for so many decades 
going back. When he speaks about the situation we are in in Iraq, he 
speaks with not only great feeling but also with great experience, and 
I think every Member of this body treasures our relationship with 
Senator McCain and the


experience he brings to this debate. He has the commitment, I hope, of 
everybody in this body that the debate, as we proceed relative to Iraq 
or any other issues in this week and next, will proceed in a very civil 
way.

This issue requires all of the wisdom we can muster, all of the 
experiences of the various Members, and he has my assurance, and I 
think he would have the assurance of every Member of this body, that 
the tone he sets and wants us to maintain will indeed be maintained by 
this Senate. I am confident of that, and thank him again for his 
remarks and for his great contribution to this bill.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional 
Budget Office cost estimate of the Senate version of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which was not available 
when the report on that bill, S. 1547, was filed, be printed in the 
Record.
