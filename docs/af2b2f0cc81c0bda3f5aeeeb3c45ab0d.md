Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the chairman very much for his 
work, very hard work, I might add, Chairman Berman, and to the ranking 
member for the opportunity to support this legislation that has the 
Senate title. I also support the House bill, which we worked very hard 
on. But I support the idea that this bill provides for enhanced 
monitoring, evaluation, and auditing of U.S. assistance. It requires a 
Presidential report on Pakistan, including an evaluation of Pakistan's 
progress on counterterrorism and an assessment of whether assistance 
provided to Pakistan is in any way facilitating the expansion of 
Pakistan's nuclear weapons program and requires that all assistance to 
Pakistan be provided through a civilian government.

We are treading water if we keep going back over and over again on 
what was. Yes, we have to acknowledge that Pakistan was our friend in 
the Cold War, and we have to know the Pakistan people in fact want 
democracy. They are strong and resilient people. When they had the 
tragedy in the Swat territory, those individuals that went to refugee 
camps did not stay long. Why? Because they wanted to go back and 
restore their lives and work.

We need to establish friends with those who want to be friends. We 
know for sure that the Pakistan military has lost and shed blood on the 
border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Yes, there are problems which we 
can fix with this legislation, $1.5 billion a year that will help them 
on their economic recovery.

I am disappointed that the legislation that Congressman Van Hollen 
had, that we have not been able to work that through. We worked it in 
the House bill on the investment zones, if you will, which I think is a 
positive step. But what we did do is we provided opportunity for 
schooling and an opportunity to ensure that young Pakistani men are not 
drawn to the teachings of those who would do harm, the violent 
teachings that have gone on, giving them alternatives in terms of 
promoting education.

My friends, don't throw the baby away with the bath water. We have 
friends in Pakistan. That government needs to know that we are an ally, 
but oversight is imperative. A regional plan is imperative, and 
recognizing a friend when you see it. Fight the Taliban. Fight Osama 
bin Laden. Recognize your friends, and pass this legislation.
