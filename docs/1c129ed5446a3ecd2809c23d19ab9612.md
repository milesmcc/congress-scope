Mrs. SCHMIDT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2078, 
legislation to name the United States Postal Facility in Cherry Fork, 
Ohio, as the ''Staff Sergeant Omer T. 'O.T.' Hawkins Post Office.'' I 
would urge my colleagues to support this legislation to honor an 
American hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation.

Born on November 29, 1972, O.T. always knew he wanted to be a 
soldier; and at the age of 10 he actually wrote the Army requesting 
that he become a member of the Army. In high school, he was a member of 
the academic team and was voted ''Most Likely to Succeed.'' Instead of 
going to college or taking another career path, just shortly after 
graduation he joined the Army.

In the Army, O.T. quickly developed a leadership style armed with an 
arsenal of wit and knowledge that was admired by all who served with 
him. His deployments took him across the globe, including Desert Storm, 
Somalia, Haiti, Egypt twice, Bosnia, and Kosovo. His colleagues 
described him as a tremendous soldier, someone who loved his country.

U.S. Army SSGT Omer O.T. Hawkins died on Thursday, October 14, 2004, 
in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb. His 
letter as an innocent young boy illustrates the lifelong desire O.T. 
had to serve his country and why I am humbled to sponsor this bill 
honoring him.

He believed in what he did, and his last message was:




 ''I will continue to fight when others falter and grow 


 weary of their duty. I firmly believe in the Constitution. In 


 fact, I believe it applies to all humanity, not just 


 America.''


I would like to share a poem written by O.T.'s nephew Joshua for his 
funeral:




 ''A soldier isn't judged by how good his aim is or how many 


 bullets he's used. He isn't judged by how many lives he's 


 taken or how many ribbons decorate his uniform. He won't be 


 judged by how many wars he's fought or enemies he's made.



 ''A soldier is judged by how many flags hang for him and 


 how many yellow ribbons decorate cars for him.



 ''I know my Uncle O.T. is above us smiling because he knows 


 that in 20 years people won't remember how many medals he 


 received but how hard he fought for his country.''


Please help ensure that future generations of SSGT O.T. Hawkins' 
family, friends, and neighbors in Cherry Fork, Ohio, never forget how 
hard he fought for his country.

Please support H.R. 2078.
