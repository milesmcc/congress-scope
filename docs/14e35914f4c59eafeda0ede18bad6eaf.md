Mr. TANNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Madam Speaker, if we were in Afghanistan by ourselves, perhaps this 
debate would be worthwhile, but the fact is we are not.

I am presently serving as the president of the NATO Parliamentary 
Assembly. The Afghan effort is a NATO-led effort.

NATO, arguably, one, if not the most successful military alliances in 
the modern era, is not only involved with us as allies in Afghanistan, 
but we know that our military might is no longer a deterrent like it 
was most of my life, most of our lives, during the Cold War. With a 
doctrine of mutually assured destruction, even though you had the 
bipolar world of East versus West and even though you had the USSR and 
their buddies and the United States and our allies, there was this, not 
only feeling, but we were protected by our military might. 9/11 
shattered that. These people who are trying to kill us don't care how 
many aircraft carriers we have, how many tanks we have, how many 
submarines we have. It doesn't matter.

Therefore, if our military might is no longer our primary defense, 
what is? I would suggest that it is accurate, timely intelligence to 
know who, what, when, where, and how they want to try to attack us 
again so we can stop it.

How do we maximize that defense? We do it through allies. We do it 
through friends of ours. The French really have the best intelligence 
network in northern Africa. They are helping. They are helping in NATO.
