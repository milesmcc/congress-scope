`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 9 July 2008`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Thank you so very much.

Florida is front and center in the solution on the Republican side of 
the whole oil crisis issue. And we started talking about deficit 
spending. We started talking about what is happening to the American 
family, and I think that it's very important.

I heard you, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Altmire, say something earlier about 
the folks in Iraq taking the responsibility. They are now calling for a 
timeline. It's interesting that the administration is not calling for a 
timeline.

And I think it's important, Madam Speaker, when we look at $8.5 
billion a month, that's not anything to look away from. That's a lot of 
money. And I can tell you that there's a number of folks that would 
like to see that kind of money invested here in the United States.

Let me just mention one thing. The Speaker a few days ago wrote a 
letter to the President. Two months ago she asked for oil to be taken 
out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that we have here. This letter 
is, I believe, on speaker.gov, which is on Speaker
Nancy Pelosi's Web 
site. It asks the President to dip into the oil reserves, that we have 
over 90 days of reserve that's in these oil reserves.

This has been done before. This is not what you may call a new idea. 
This is not a radical idea. It's been done by not only the first 
President Bush, his father, but also by President Clinton and by this 
President during Katrina.

I just want to take a couple of excerpts from this letter. It says: 
''Two months ago, after initially opposing our proposal to suspend the 
government's purchase of high-priced oil from the Strategic Oil 
Reserve, you signed the bipartisan legislation into law.''

A couple of paragraphs down, it talks about the fact that oil was $30 
per barrel when his administration took office and now has hit $150 per 
barrel. And I think it's important for us to look at the $1.47 average 
when he came into office and the $4.11 per gallon.

In 1990, 1991 Desert Shield, Desert Storm, when George H. W. Bush the 
first drew down from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on January 17, 
1991, it actually bought oil prices down per barrel $8. In 2000, in the 
face of high energy prices, the oil prices, President Clinton signed an 
executive order authorizing a withdrawal of 30 million barrels that 
were released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that actually 
brought the price per barrel down from $30.94 to $20.38, which is a 37 
percent decrease. And this is backed up by the Select Committee on 
Energy Independence and Global Warming of April 24, 2008.

Then we look at Hurricane Katrina. President Bush has done this 
before. Hurricane Katrina in 2005, because the Gulf States were hit, 
the administration offered 30 million gallons from the Strategic Oil 
Reserve that actually brought down the price per barrel by $5.

Why do I mention what has happened in the past, which should happen 
here in the present? The real issue is it's 97 percent full at this 
particular time, well beyond the International Energy Program as it 
relates to the 90-day reserve stock that should be there. When the 
President makes a decision, in 13 days, you will see oil prices go 
down. Why is this important, Madam Speaker and Members? This is very 
important because the American people are having to make a choice. If 
they're going to drive to work or they're going to drive their children 
to school, especially in rural America and even in urban America, they 
are having to make those decisions.



There were families that had to make the decision if they were going 
to see their family members or go to the family reunion this last July 
4th, which is one of the most celebrated holidays in our country, which 
is our independence. They could not make that decision to drive because 
of the price of oil. We have companies that are laying off workers as 
we stand here today because of the issue of oil per barrel.

I talked to Chairman Oberstar. We took the opportunity to do it. Mr. 
Ryan and I were in a meeting today. Chairman Oberstar stated the 
following, the chairman of the Transportation Committee: A $10 drop in 
the price per barrel of oil will result in a savings of $420 million 
per year to Northwest Airlines. It also would mean a savings of $840 
million for United Airlines. It would also mean a savings of $900 
million per year for American Airlines.

What does that mean? That means that the American people will not be 
nickel-and-dimed as we are now as they travel throughout this country.
