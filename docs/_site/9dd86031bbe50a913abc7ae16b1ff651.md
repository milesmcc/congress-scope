Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak with some great 
urgency on the need to pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 
2007, S. 5.

We must pass this bill because if we do not, the American people will 
continue to suffer, our brilliant researchers will be discouraged and 
think about leaving the field of scientific research and, No. 3, we are 
also outsourcing our intellectual capital because other research is 
going overseas.

We have to have a sense of urgency because stem cell research takes a 
long time. We cannot have science on demand or scientists on demand. If 
we do not act now, we are going to be discouraging very important 
research and wonderful young people from going into this field.

Every year we wait, we fall 3 years behind in our research--another 
time where a patient might have been saved, a family might not have had 
to watch a loved one suffer, and also where we would not have to watch 
our great ideas going somewhere else.

Stem cell research is very important to the American people. It is 
very important to Maryland. It is very important to me. I am a firm, 
clear, unabashed supporter of expanded stem cell research and, at the 
same time, that this research be conducted under the strictest 
bioethical standards. That is why I like S. 5. This legislation is 
based on sound cellular biology science and also good, sound ethical 
principles.

This legislation is so important not because legislation is important 
but because it opens more opportunity to do stem cell research. What 
does that mean? It means that currently the existing law under 
President Bush restricts stem cell research to adult cells, to some 
vague 21 lines that are becoming tired and toxic. But under our 
legislation, it would open it up to embryonic stem cell research where 
embryos are garnered that are discarded in in vitro processes in which 
the donors themselves have to make that informed choice.

What does this do, though? Well, I will tell you, stem cell research 
is the kind of research that could find a cure for Parkinson's disease, 
diabetes, diseases of the brain and the immune system, multiple 
sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Imagine if scientists could find a 
cure for Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or if they cannot find a cure, to 
be able to regenerate new kinds of brain cells to give people a 
cognitive or functioning stretchout. Think about the impact on 
families, but also think about the impact on our nursing home budget.

Think about research in juvenile diabetes, type 1 diabetes, where 
little children, every day--whether they are 5 or 9 or 11--have to be 
testing their blood sugar. They cannot eat the way other kids do. They 
have to watch how they pace themselves when they play ball or do other 
things so they do not induce hypoglycemia. As they get older and their 
cells get even more tired, they fear they could lose a kidney or lose 
their eyesight.

If we could find more breakthroughs in juvenile diabetes, we would 
give them their childhood back. We would give them a life that has a 
future full of promise. That is why we are fighting here. It is not 
about ideology. It is not about party. It is about our American people. 
And what we invent here could help save lives everywhere.

Yesterday, I went to Johns Hopkins University to discuss this stem 
cell research. I wanted to be sure I was on the right track: sound 
science, good, solid ethical frameworks. I said to the scientists: Tell 
me what you are doing and tell me what impedes you now working under 
the Bush framework?

Well, they gave me an earful. First, it is inspirational--
inspirational--in what they are doing in pediatric leukemia, in 
juvenile diabetes, in multiple sclerosis. Also, to give an example, in 
talking to Dr. Doug Kerr, he is working now through stem cells--yes, it 
is with paralyzed rats--to not only regenerate the spinal cord but to 
have those cells connect to muscle so not only for whether you are 
regenerating spinal cords that have been injured or severed, but also 
to connect the muscle so you could walk again. That was the dream of 
Christopher Reeve. But that is the dream of every paraplegic right 
now--whether it has come from a diving accident, if you are an athlete, 
or whether you have been injured in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Don't we want Dr. Kerr to do what he is doing now and to be able to 
extend that? But they do not get the clinical


trials because they are restricted in the types of cells they can use.

So we saw a cornucopia, again, of opportunity there. But I said to 
the docs at Hopkins: Why can't we do this with private or State funds? 
They said: Senator Mikulski, you have to have a national framework. 
First, that is where you get your bioethical guidelines. It is done not 
while there is one set of guidelines for States that can afford 
research and that there is another set of guidelines for those States 
that can't. Also, there is not enough in private philanthropic funds to 
be able to do this.


Private funds function like venture capital. But at the same time, 
what happens with States? Maryland is now in a bidding war with our $25 
million against California. We have scientists who are leaving Maryland 
to go to California. Hats off to them. But also, then, we have 
scientists in Maryland and California who are leaving the country 
because they can do work in Sweden or Singapore that they cannot do in 
their own country. These are American scientists who want to do their 
own work in their own country. But we are driving them out with our 
narrow-minded ideological sense of politicizing science.

So we cannot do this with State funds, and we cannot do it with 
private funds. As I said, right now we are outsourcing this to China, 
to Singapore, to Australia, to Germany. I am not saying there are good 
countries or not good countries, but what are we doing? We are losing 
our intellectual capital. We are also losing our young scientists.

Yesterday, I talked to a young doctor. I knew him as a resident. His 
wife was a friend of a friend of mine. I knew him through his 
residency. Now he is a young doctor, married, with three children. His 
whole field is diabetes. He is so eager to do this juvenile diabetic 
research. He has already started it. He is already good at it. Gosh, 
maybe he could win the Nobel prize one day. But guess what. There is 
not the money for the young scientist. Also, with the very shackling of 
what goes on now in these so-called Bush lines, with these ideological 
guidelines, they cannot do the research. He has to think hard about 
whether he wants to continue his life dream of finding a cure for 
juvenile diabetes.

You see, this man has devoted his life to getting ready to do this, 
and now his own Government is stopping him--not because he is not 
smart, not because we do not have the will, but because we have too 
much ideology and too little money in the wallet.

We have a President who has given us a framework where research has 
one hand behind its back. Scientists have been prohibited from doing 
new stem cell research.

Six years ago, the President restricted Federal funds for embryonic 
stem cell research. What did it do? It created an unregulated 
atmosphere. The result was federally funded stem cell research was 
halted almost entirely. Stem cell research was done by private 
entities. A private entity has no Federal bioethical standards.

Mr. President, like you, I am a sunshine person. I believe you should 
have research conducted in the sunshine. That is where you have 
compliance with bioethical standards. That is why we need to have the 
kind of national framework where everybody goes by the same rules, at 
the same time, in the same way. Without national standards, research 
will be done by the well-heeled, outside of the public eye, with no 
national scrutiny. This is where I fear dark and ghoulish things can 
occur.

I acknowledge the validity of some of the concerns raised by 
colleagues. But as long as you shove it underground, as long as you 
shove it behind closed doors, then you are going to get either faulty 
research or very bad ethics.

I believe the legislation pending will remove the restrictions 
imposed by the President. It will provide the ethical and medical 
framework we need for federally funded stem cell research. It will 
create strong ethical guidelines. Most of all, it will ensure that we 
now open the opportunity for even greater and more expanded stem cell 
research so scientists will now have access to new, fresh stem cell 
lines which they now do not.

What does it mean? Well, I can tell you what it means. It means for 
the United States of America we have heard what the voters said in 
November. They said: Change the direction of the country. Change the 
priorities. Come back home, America. Remember what America is. We are 
the land of the free, the home of the brave, and of discovery. Let's go 
for it.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
