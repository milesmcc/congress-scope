`Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN â€” 25 April 2007`

Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this 
rule and to this conference report.

Fundamentally, this bill is about providing funding for our troops, 
making sure that men and women who are on the front lines as we speak, 
have the resources they need to stay safe and do their military and 
humanitarian missions in Iraq.

It is clear that our troops have the support of this House and the 
American people. Surely, no one wants to see our soldiers defeated in 
Iraq. We all want their mission in Iraq to be as short as possible. We 
want the war to end. We want our young soldiers, all volunteers, to 
return home.

But this conference report before us today prejudges the 
effectiveness of our young warfighters as they seek to secure Baghdad 
under a new plan, under new military leadership.

This proposal starts withdrawal of our forces from Iraq on October 1, 
irrespective of the judgment of our military commanders on the ground.

My colleagues, the reinforcement of the Army in Baghdad and the 
Marines in Anbar, designed and executed by General David Petraeus, is 
underway. It won't be complete for weeks.

And yet, there are some signs of progress. The plan must be given 
time to work. Make no mistake about it. There will be wide and 
dangerous consequences if we abandon the Iraqi people and their 
government, now just 1 year old, before it is capable of governing and 
protecting its own people. First, for our own soldiers there are 
consequences. And secondly, we could have an explosion of sectarian 
violence, killing and bloodshed on a larger, more barbaric scale than 
we have now.

Mr. Speaker, we are a Nation at war and the stakes are extremely high 
for America. Our troops need this money now. They deserved it 
yesterday.



Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join together to honor the 
service of our young men and women and to work with the President, our 
Commander in Chief, to have some measure of success in Iraq. I urge a 
''no'' vote on the rule and the conference report.
