`Mr. ROGERS of Alabama â€” 1 April 2008`

---


Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I would like to request the 
House's attention today to recognize the life of a heroic American 
citizen, Capt. Torre Mallard.

Captain Mallard, a native of Anniston, Alabama, died in Iraq on March 
10, 2008. He is survived by his wife, Bonita and two children, Torre, 
Jr. and Joshua.

Like all those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in this conflict, 
words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family, and 
the gratitude our country feels for his service. Captain Mallard died 
serving the United States and the entire cause of liberty, on a mission 
to bring stability to a troubled region and liberty to a formerly 
oppressed people. He was a true patriot indeed.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the House's 
remembrance on this mournful day.
