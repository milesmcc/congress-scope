Mr. HOYER. I thank the Republican whip for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House is not in session. On Tuesday, the 
House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for 
legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday 
and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. 
And on Friday, if needed, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative 
business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. 
A complete list of suspension bills will be announced by close of 
business tomorrow, as is the custom.

In addition, Mr. Speaker, we will consider H. Con. Res. 248, the 
Afghanistan war powers resolution introduced by Mr. Kucinich, and we 
will also consider H. Res. 1031, impeaching G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., 
judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Louisiana, for high crimes and misdemeanors. It is also possible there 
will be further action on the jobs agenda, which depends on what the 
Senate or the House has coming out of committee or out of the Senate.
