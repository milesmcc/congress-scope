Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the supplemental funding bill 
that will provide the men and women of our Armed Forces with the 
resources that they need to do the job. Unfortunately this bill will 
not just fund operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. It seems to me as if 
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle never miss an opportunity 
to use the military to pack a bill with pork.

Under the pretext of funding operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, this 
bill is loaded with billions of dollars worth of spending that simply 
does not belong there. It is obvious to me that these programs do not 
directly impact the ability of our servicemembers to do their job. They 
are priorities of the majority that should be voted on separately based 
on their own merits.

We have a lot of questions about the Guantanamo detainees. Will they 
end up in Leavenworth, as the gentleman from Kansas mentioned? Will 
they end up in the largest Federal prison in the United States, which 
happens to be in my district? Let me tell you, I think Americans need 
to know the answer to that.

Despite the political games that my colleagues are playing, I will 
support this legislation because I support our troops and believe it's 
our responsibility to give them the tools that they need.
