Mr. BAIRD. I would just like to thank you for supporting this 
initiative and would in turn support your proposal.

What this comes out of is citizens saying, Look, we've got young men 
and women, and as many people know in this conflict, it's not just 
young men and women, it's people of all ages overseas in Iraq and 
Afghanistan and throughout the country. And when they come back home, 
we want to show them our support. It's a fine thing and a proper thing 
that we would wave a flag and say thank you for your service. But 
sometimes people need more than just a thanks. Sometimes they need the 
ability to visit a loved one; sometimes they need a home repaired; 
sometimes they need a little bit of help financially to go to school. 
And the kind of program that we are putting forward today allows over 
and above what we are already providing through our VA services to 
average citizens to provide support for doing just that. It sounds like 
that is what you are seeking to do, Mr. Kennedy. I commend you for your 
efforts and look forward to working with you.

Mr. KENNEDY: I likewise thank the gentleman.
