Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding. The 
Senator made the point that the liberal left wants us out of Iraq. I 
want to make sure the Senator is aware that the latest polls show 70 
percent of the American people want us to have a strategy to leave. And 
my question is, A, is the Senator aware of that? And, B, the followup 
to that question is, has the Senator read the various proposals, the 
Levin-Reed proposal, which I strongly support? There is no precipitous 
withdrawal.

I think the Senator is setting up a straw man, if you will, here. The 
fact is, those of us who want to leave want to do it in the right way--
