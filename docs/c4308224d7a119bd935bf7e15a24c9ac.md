Mr. BUYER. I would say to the gentleman that just spoke, that in 3 
years Iraq has gone from a repressive dictatorship who enslaved his 
people to an inclusive government chosen by a freely elected Parliament 
under a popular ratified constitution. That is a fact.

I would like to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. Inglis).
