`Mr. BAUCUS â€” 10 January 2007`

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to engage the managers here. It is 
my understanding I will have time shortly to give a statement on Iraq. 
I don't want to interfere with the legislation on the floor, and I am 
asking whether this would be a good time for that statement to take 
about maybe 15, 20 minutes.

I see no objection.
