# SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SCIENCE EDUCATION
## `c58a686e8b93c3cd825ab2ba112744ff`
`Mr. HOLT â€” 4 June 2008`

---


Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and 
commend my colleague, Eddie Bernice Johnson, for introducing it and the 
chairman of the Science Committee for bringing it forward.

This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that increasing 
American capabilities in science, mathematics, and technology education 
should be a national priority. And I must say, I hope Members on the 
other side of this aisle will avoid distracting us with red herrings 
across the trail and debating other diverting matters such as drilling 
and digging in the United States and stick to this topic which is of 
critical importance.

Since first coming to Congress almost a decade ago, I stressed the 
need for a new major national effort to improve science, mathematics, 
and technology education. I'm a product of the science revolution in 
the United States that occurred following the launch of Sputnik in 
1957. And today, as this resolution notes, we must recommit ourselves 
to creating a new generation of scientists, engineers, and 
mathematicians, and just as important, indeed more important, we need 
to build a general public that is literate and comfortable with 
science, math, technology.

I would ask at this point to include in the Record a copy of a recent 
op-ed essay entitled ''Put a Little Science in Your Life'' by Brian 
Greene, professor of physics at Columbia and author of The Elegant 
Universe. He discusses the importance of science in everyone's lives, 
not just scientists.

 Put a Little Science in Your Life














 (By Brian Greene)




 A couple of years ago I received a letter from an American 


 soldier in Iraq. The letter began by saying that, as we've 


 all become painfully aware, serving on the front lines is 


 physically exhausting and emotionally debilitating. But the 


 reason for his writing was to tell me that in that hostile 


 and lonely environment, a book I'd written had become a kind 


 of lifeline. As the book is about science--one that traces 


 physicists' search for nature's deepest laws--the soldier's 


 letter might strike you as, well, odd.



 But it's not. Rather, it speaks to the powerful role 


 science can play in giving life context and meaning. At the 


 same time, the soldier's letter emphasized something I've 


 increasingly come to believe: our educational system fails to 


 teach science in a way that allows students to integrate it 


 into their lives.



 Allow me a moment to explain.



 When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones, iPods, 


 personal computers and the Internet, it's easy to see how 


 science (and the technology to which it leads) is woven into 


 the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from 


 CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, 


 we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality 


 of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and 


 identify looming challenges like climate change, global 


 pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we 


 don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems 


 and find solutions.



 And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on 


 the horizon--stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized 


 medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine 


 interface, quantum computers, space technology--we realize 


 how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can 


 engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way 


 that as a society we will be prepared to make informed 


 decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future.



 These are the standard--and enormously important--reasons 


 many would give in explaining why science matters.



 But here's the thing. The reason science really matters 


 runs deeper still. Science is a way of life. Science is a 


 perspective. Science is the process that takes us from 


 confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, 


 predictive and reliable--a transformation, for those lucky 


 enough to experience it, that is empowering and emotional. To 


 be able to think through and grasp explanations--for 


 everything from why the sky is blue to how life formed on 


 earth--not because they are declared dogma but rather because 


 they reveal patterns confirmed by experiment and observation, 


 is one of the most precious of human experiences.



 As a practicing scientist, I know this from my own work and 


 study. But I also know that you don't have to be a scientist 


 for science to be transformative. I've seen children's eyes 


 light up as I've told them about black holes and the Big 


 Bang. I've spoken with high school dropouts who've 


 stumbled on popular science books about the human genome 


 project, and then returned to school with newfound 


 purpose. And in that letter from Iraq, the soldier told me 


 how learning about relativity and quantum physics in the 


 dusty and dangerous environs of greater Baghdad kept him 


 going because it revealed a deeper reality of which we're 


 all a part.



 It's striking that science is still widely viewed as merely 


 a subject one studies in the classroom or an isolated body of 


 largely esoteric knowledge that sometimes shows up in the 


 ''real'' world in the form of technological or medical 


 advances. In reality, science is a language of hope and 


 inspiration, providing discoveries that fire the imagination 


 and instill a sense of connection to our lives and our world.



 If science isn't your strong suit--and for many it's not--


 this side of science is something you may have rarely if ever 


 experienced. I've spoken with so many people over the years 


 whose encounters with science in school left them thinking of 


 it as cold, distant and intimidating. They happily use the 


 innovations that science makes possible, but feel that the 


 science itself is just not relevant to their lives. What a 


 shame.



 Like a life without music, art or literature, a life 


 without science is bereft of something that gives experience 


 a rich and otherwise inaccessible dimension.



 It's one thing to go outside on a crisp, clear night and 


 marvel at a sky full of stars. It's another to marvel not 


 only at the spectacle but to recognize that those stars are 


 the result of exceedingly ordered conditions 13.7 billion 


 years ago at the moment of the Big Bang. It's another still 


 to understand how those stars act as nuclear furnaces that 


 supply the universe with carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, the raw 


 material of life as we know it.



 And it's yet another level of experience to realize that 


 those stars account for less than 4 percent of what's out 


 there--the rest being of an unknown composition, so-called 


 dark matter and energy, which researchers are now vigorously 


 trying to divine.



 As every parent knows, children begin life as uninhibited, 


 unabashed explorers of the unknown. From the time we can walk 


 and talk, we want to know what things are and how they work--


 we begin life as little scientists. But most of us quickly 


 lose our intrinsic scientific passion. And it's a profound 


 loss.



 A great many studies have focused on this problem, 


 identifying important opportunities for improving science 


 education. Recommendations have ranged from increasing the 


 level of training for science teachers to curriculum reforms.



 But most of these studies (and their suggestions) avoid an 


 overarching systemic issue: in teaching our students, we 


 continually fail to activate rich opportunities for revealing 


 the breathtaking vistas opened up by science, and instead 


 focus on the need to gain competency with science's 


 underlying technical details.



 In fact, many students I've spoken to have little sense of 


 the big questions those technical details collectively try to 


 answer: Where did the universe come from? How did life 


 originate? How does the brain give rise to consciousness? 


 Like a music curriculum that requires its students to 


 practice scales while rarely if ever inspiring them by 


 playing the great masterpieces, this way of teaching science 


 squanders the chance to make students sit up in their chairs 


 and say, ''Wow, that's science?''



 In physics, just to give a sense of the raw material that's 


 available to be leveraged, the most revolutionary of advances 


 have happened in the last 100 years--special relativity, 


 general relativity, quantum mechanics--a symphony of 


 discoveries that changed our conception of reality. More 


 recently, the last 10 years have witnessed an upheaval in 


 our understanding of the universe's composition, yielding 


 a wholly new prediction for what the cosmos will be like 


 in the far future.



 These are paradigm-shaking developments. But rare is the 


 high school class, and rarer still is the middle school 


 class, in which these breakthroughs are introduced. It's much 


 the same story in classes for biology, chemistry and 


 mathematics.



 At the root of this pedagogical approach is a firm belief 


 in the vertical nature of science: you must master A before 


 moving on to B. When A happened a few hundred years ago, it's 


 a long climb to the modern era. Certainly, when it comes to 


 teaching the technicalities--solving this equation, balancing 


 that reaction, grasping the discrete parts of the cell--the 


 verticality of science is unassailable.



 But science is so much more than its technical details. And 


 with careful attention to presentation, cutting-edge insights 


 and discoveries can be clearly and faithfully communicated to 


 students independent of those details; in fact, those 


 insights and discoveries are precisely the ones that can 


 drive a




 young student to want to learn the details. We rob science 


 education of life when we focus solely on results and seek to 


 train students to solve problems and recite facts without a 


 commensurate emphasis on transporting them out beyond the 


 stars.



 Science is the greatest of all adventure stories, one 


 that's been unfolding for thousands of years as we have 


 sought to understand ourselves and our surroundings. Science 


 needs to be taught to the young and communicated to the 


 mature in a manner that captures this drama. We must embark 


 on a cultural shift that places science in its rightful place 


 alongside music, art and literature as an indispensable part 


 of what makes life worth living.



 It's the birthright of every child, it's a necessity for 


 every adult, to look out on the world, as the soldier in Iraq 


 did, and see that the wonder of the cosmos transcends 


 everything that divides us.


There is no denying that America is losing ground and global 
competitiveness to countries that are making the necessary investments 
in education and research and development. We owe our current economic 
strength, our current national security, our current quality of life, 
to the investments of past generations.

However, the Federal Government has failed to fund adequately 
research, development, and innovation. Investment in these areas 
ensures that American people will continue to benefit from 
opportunities of the rapidly growing global economy and its inherent 
foundations.

In August of 2007, this body passed into law, as my colleague from 
Texas pointed out, a comprehensive competitiveness package, the America 
COMPETES Act, which was based on disturbing findings of the National 
Academies' report, ''Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' that our 
Nation is severely underinvesting in engineering and the physical 
sciences.

Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2008 budget fell short of the required 
goal. Without taking a bold, different approach in this year's 
appropriation cycle, Congress will be delivering a blow to our future 
economic security and competitiveness.

I thank gentlelady for introducing this legislation. I hope we pay 
heed.
