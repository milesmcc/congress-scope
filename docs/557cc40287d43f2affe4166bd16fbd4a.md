`Mr. HAGEL â€” 12 June 2008`

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to wish happy birthday to the 
oldest branch of our Armed Forces, the U.S. Army. Two hundred and 
thirty-three years ago, June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress 
approved the creation of a Continental Army--10 companies of riflemen, 
to defend American liberty. From the Revolutionary War to Iraq and 
Afghanistan, our men and women have served with bravery, selflessness 
and noble purpose.

Love of their country has inspired men and women to serve a cause 
greater than themselves. Regard for the principles our Nation was 
founded on motivates them to continue to fight and defend.

To say simply our Armed Forces have shaped history is an 
understatement. They have not only shaped history, they have defined 
America, and represented our nation's highest values . . . ''Duty, 
Honor, Country.''

Every generation of soldiers since the foundation of our country has 
protected our democracy and helped make the world more peaceful, secure 
and prosperous.

The sacrifices our soldiers have made in service to our country, and 
the price their families have paid are worthy of America's honor and 
respect. So as we celebrate the Army's 233rd birthday, we really 
celebrate our men and women in uniform who have given so much. Thank 
you.

In the Army's grandest tradition and as a proud Army veteran, I 
proclaim my annual Senate floor . . . ''HOOAH!''
