`Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida â€” 5 February 2007`

Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today about 
my bill, H.R. 514, which passed the House earlier today. The bill will 
rename the Aviation Post Office in Brooksville, Florida, after Sergeant 
Lea Robert Mills. This is the Post Office that Lea used because it is 
close to his parents' home in Masaryktown, Florida.

Lea was a resident of my district who gave his life for his country 
while serving in Iraq. At 21 years old, Lea was proud to serve his 
fellow citizens, and he actually requested to be sent to Iraq.

After being inspired to volunteer for the military after the 
September 11 attacks, he felt it was his duty, as a Marine, to go where 
the mission was. Lea told his father that the Marines would give him 
the best opportunity to make a difference in people's lives.

He joined right after graduating from Hernando High School in 2002, 
and he had just recently ''re-upped'' for a second stint with the 
Marines. Tragically, he was killed by an IED explosion, leaving behind 
a young wife and a grieving family.

Sergeant Mills was a true patriot and brave hero, and our community 
feels his loss immensely. His dedication to his country and turning his 
ideals into action are truly inspiring. It is a sad truth that in a 
cynical world, we are sometimes surprised by such courageous acts.

Learning about Lea from his family and friends helped me to have 
faith that not everyone is just trying to get by. Some are trying to 
change the world for the better.

Dee Mills, who is Lea's mother, was so brave and so patriotic at the 
funeral. I don't think I will ever, ever forget that. While others who 
have lost loved ones grieve in very different ways, Dee Mills, like her 
son, decided to help change the world. Dee has put together a 
501(c)(3), and it is called Lea's Prayers and Postage. And the purpose 
of this organization is to raise money to send packages to our young 
men and women currently serving in Iraq. What a wonderful cause, what a 
wonderful way to work out one's grief at losing her son.

I can only hope that in renaming this Post Office we will memorialize 
Lea's courage and never, ever forget his sacrifice for this great 
Nation.

Both Lea Robert Mills and Dee Mills, his mom, have given so much to 
the community and so much to America that I am very proud to represent 
the Masaryktown area and certainly the Mills family.
