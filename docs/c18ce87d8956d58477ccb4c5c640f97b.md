Mr. WOLF. I just want the Members to know that the son of former 
Congressman Duncan Hunter, now currently Congressman Duncan Hunter who 
just spoke here about the flag drape policy with regard to our fallen 
soldiers who return to Dover Air Force Base, served in Iraq in combat 
and served in Afghanistan in combat. I think that the Obama 
administration ought to listen to people who serve.
