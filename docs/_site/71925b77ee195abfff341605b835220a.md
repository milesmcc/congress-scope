`Mr. DURBIN â€” 8 May 2007`

---


Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for a long time in Washington, if you 
talked about a deadline or a timetable, the response from the 
President, from the administration, even from the Republican side of 
the aisle, was the same. When you talked about a specific end to this 
war, they argued: It endangers our troops.

I did not agree with that premise. In fact, I believed this was the 
only way to convince the Iraqis we were not going to stay forever. If 
they think the very best military in the world, the American military 
forces, will stay there indefinitely, there is no incentive for them to 
make the right decisions, the hard decisions to govern their own 
country.

Well, time has passed at great cost to our Nation. As of this 
morning, we have lost 3,361 of our best and brightest soldiers--3,361. 
The month of April was the deadliest month this year in Iraq: 104 
American soldiers lost their lives. I think we all understand now that 
as each day passes, more American soldiers are in danger and, sadly, 
more will give their lives. So to wait for a month, two or three or 
four, is, sadly, to extend that period of time of danger.

Now we find from Republican leaders a new approach. No longer are 
they rejecting the idea of deadlines or timetables. In fact, they are 
starting to speak in more specific terms.

This is a quote from the Republican leader of the House, John 
Boehner, who said:




 By the time we get to September or October, members are 


 going to want to know how well this is working, and if it 


 isn't, what's Plan B?


That, to me, sounds like a deadline of September or October.

Then, of course, our colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, said:




 I do think this fall we have to see some significant 


 changes on the ground, in Baghdad and other surrounding 


 areas.


I think it is an indication that our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are hearing the same thing we hear when we go home: First, an 
immense pride in our men and women in uniform, pride as well in their 
families who have stood by them through this long struggle; an 
understanding of the sacrifices that are being made by our soldiers as 
well as those who love them so very much but, secondly, an 
understanding that this is a failed policy that the President is 
pursuing in Iraq.

This is the fifth year of this war. This war has lasted longer than 
World War II. It is now only exceeded in cost by the cost of World War 
II in today's dollars. It is an extremely expensive undertaking, first, 
in human life, with over 3,000 Americans dying, and then with thousands 
coming home injured, some very seriously injured, with traumatic brain 
injury and amputations.

Senator Murray of Washington has been a leader when it comes to the 
care for our returning soldiers and veterans. We know our system is 
breaking down and falling behind, increasing the sense of urgency I 
feel and many feel in Illinois, as I see them on the streets of Chicago 
and Springfield and all around my State. They understand this is a 
heavy cost we are paying.

When our friends on the Republican side of the aisle say all we need 
is maybe 4 or 5 more months, I hope they understand that time they are 
asking


for is time that will have a heavy price. They want us to buy some time 
for political purposes but at a heavy price.


We think, and I hope they will come to understand, we need to tell 
the Iraqis now they have the responsibility to govern and lead. If they 
fail, then American troops are not going to stay there indefinitely. 
Some worry when American troops leave, there may be an unstable 
situation in Iraq. That is entirely possible. That can happen if we 
leave in 10 months, 10 years, or 15 years.

They have to understand the responsibility of the future of Iraq lies 
in the hands of the Iraqis. We cannot put that burden on American 
soldiers and their families any longer. I am heartened by these 
statements from the Republican side that finally they understand we 
cannot stay there forever, that the policy of this administration has 
not succeeded, that we owe it to soldiers and their families to treat 
them humanely, to let them know they will be coming home to a hero's 
welcome soon.

Our colleagues, Senator Jim Webb and Carl Levin, as well as Jack 
Reed, have spoken out about the readiness of our troops, too. I worry 
about that. As the President has extended this war, far beyond what 
anyone ever dreamed of, those who voted for that authorization of 
force, as he has extended this war, have put pressure on our soldiers 
beyond anything we could have imagined.

We have extended the tours of duty for National Guard members to the 
longest period of time since World War II. We now know many of our 
soldiers are asked to stay on an additional 3 months after they have 
served 12. We know when they come home, they do not receive the rest 
they were promised, the time with their family. They are quickly 
reactivated and sent into battle.

This has to have an impact on morale. It certainly has a negative 
impact on their families. So I believe as we talk about how this war is 
to be waged and what the next stage will be, regardless of what our 
plan may be, it has to include readiness and a commitment to these 
troops. I think it is important that we say to the President: Don't 
send a single soldier into harm's way or into combat unless they have 
had the time to rest, unless they have been retrained and equipped, 
unless they are prepared to go to battle with all of the forces they 
need to come home safely.

Shortchanging our soldiers is not a strategy that we should follow in 
Iraq. Let's come up with a plan to start bringing these troops home. We 
sent one to the President last week. He, in a press conference, told 
the American people he was going to reject it. We haven't heard 
anything back from him since then. But, in the meantime, many members 
of his own party have decided it is time for them to finally speak up. 
We welcome them. We need them. We need them particularly on this 
supplemental bill.

Mr. President, if a handful of Republican Senators will now cross the 
aisle and join us, we can have a positive impact on changing this 
failed policy in Iraq. We can finally stand as one in a bipartisan way 
and say there is a better way; that the Iraqis cannot take long 
vacations while the members of their parliament relax as our soldiers 
risk their lives. We have to tell the Iraqis we are not going to stay 
indefinitely.

When leaders such as Mr. Boehner of Ohio speak of plan B, just 
remember what the B stands for. The B stands for bring our soldiers 
home. That is what we need to start doing in an orderly, sensible way 
as soon as possible.

Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a 
quorum.
