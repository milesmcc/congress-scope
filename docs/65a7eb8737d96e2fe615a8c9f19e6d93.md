U.S. Indirectly Paying Afghan Warlords as Part of Security Contract














 (By Karen DeYoung)




 The U.S. military is funding a massive protection racket in 


 Afghanistan, indirectly paying tens of millions of dollars to 


 warlords, corrupt public officials and the Taliban to ensure 


 safe passage of its supply convoys throughout the country, 


 according to congressional investigators.



 The security arrangements, part of a $2.16 billion 


 transport contract, violate laws on the use of private 


 contractors, as well as Defense Department regulations, and 


 ''dramatically undermine'' larger U.S. objectives of 


 curtailing corruption and strengthening effective governance 


 in Afghanistan, a report released late Monday said.



 The report describes a Defense Department that is well 


 aware that some of the money paid to contractors winds up in 


 the hands of warlords and insurgents. Military logisticians 


 on the ground are focused on getting supplies where they are 


 needed and have ''virtually no understanding of how security 


 is actually provided'' for the local truck convoys that 


 transport more than 70 percent of all goods and materials 


 used by U.S. troops. Alarms raised by prime trucking 


 contractors were met by the military ''with indifference and 


 inaction,'' the report said.



 ''The findings of this report range from sobering to 


 shocking,'' Rep. John Tierney (D-Mass.) wrote in an 


 introduction to the 79-page report, titled ''Warlord, Inc., 


 Extortion and Corruption Along the U.S. Supply Chain in 


 Afghanistan.''



 The report comes as the number of U.S. casualties is rising 


 in the Afghan war, and public and congressional support is 


 declining. The administration has been on the defensive in 


 recent weeks, insisting that the slow progress of anti-


 Taliban offensives in Helmand province and the city of 


 Kandahar does not mean that more time is needed to assess 


 whether President Obama's strategy is working.



 ''I think it's much too early to draw a negative 


 conclusion,'' said a senior administration official, speaking 


 on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal 


 deliberations. ''I think there's more positive than negative. 


 We're heading toward a year-end assessment, which will be a 


 big one for us.'' The review was set when Obama announced in 


 December that he would send an additional 30,000 troops to 


 Afghanistan and begin to withdraw them in July 2011.



 Tierney is chairman of the national security subcommittee 


 of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, 


 whose majority staff spent six months preparing the report. A 


 proponent of a smaller U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan 


 and targeted attacks on insurgents, Tierney said in an 


 interview Monday that he hopes the report will help members 


 of Congress ''analyze whether they think this is the most 


 effective way to go about dealing with terrorism. Or the most 


 cost-effective way.''



 The report's conclusions will be introduced at a hearing 


 Tuesday at which senior military and defense officials are 


 scheduled to testify. The report says that all evidence and 


 findings were made available to Republicans on the 


 subcommittee. A spokesman for Rep. Jeff Flake (Ariz.), the 


 ranking Republican, said the lawmaker will not comment until 


 he has seen the entire report.



 In testimony shortly after Obama's strategy announcement, 


 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said that ''much of 


 the corruption'' in Afghanistan has been fueled by billions 


 of dollars' worth of foreign money spent there, ''and one of 


 the major sources of funding for the Taliban is the 


 protection money.''



 Military officials said that they have begun several 


 corruption investigations in Afghanistan and that a task 


 force has been named, headed by Navy Rear Adm. Kathleen 


 Dussault, director of logistics and supply operations for the 


 chief of naval operations and former head of the Baghdad-


 based joint contracting command for Iraq and Afghanistan.



 Rear Adm. Gregory J. Smith, communications chief for U.S. 


 and NATO forces in Kabul, said that the entire Tierney report




 has not been examined but that Dussault will be ''reviewing 


 every aspect of our contracting process and recommending 


 changes to avoid our contribution to what is arguably a major 


 source of revenue that feeds the cycle of corruption.''



 The U.S. military imports virtually everything it uses in 


 Afghanistan--including food, water, fuel and ammunition--by 


 road through Pakistan or Central Asia to distribution hubs at 


 Bagram air base north of Kabul and a similar base outside 


 Kandahar. From there, containers are loaded onto trucks 


 provided by Afghan contractors under the $2.16 billion Host 


 Nation Trucking contract. Unlike in the Iraq war, the 


 security and vast majority of the trucks are provided by 


 Afghans, a difference that Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, 


 the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, has praised 


 as promoting local entrepreneurship.



 The trucks distribute the material to more than 200 U.S. 


 military outposts across Afghanistan, most of them in the 


 southern and eastern parts of the country where roads are 


 largely controlled by warlords and insurgent groups.



 The report found no direct evidence of payoffs to the 


 Taliban, but one trucking program manager estimated that $1.6 


 million to $2 million per week goes to the insurgents.



 Most of the eight companies approved for the contract are 


 Afghan-owned, but they serve largely as brokers for 


 subcontractors that provide the trucks and security for the 


 convoys, which often contain hundreds of vehicles. According 


 to the congressional report, the U.S. officers charged with 


 supervising the deliveries never travel off bases to 


 determine how the system works or to ensure that U.S. laws 


 and regulations are followed.



 The report describes a system in which subcontractors--most 


 of them well-known warlords who maintain their own militias--


 charge $1,500 to $15,000 per truck to supply guards and help 


 secure safe passage through territory they control. The most 


 powerful of them, known as Commander Ruhullah, controls 


 passage along Highway One, the principal route between Kabul 


 and Kandahar, under the auspices of Watan Risk Management, a 


 company owned by two of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's 


 cousins.



 Overall management of who wins the security subcontracts, 


 it said, is often controlled by local political powerbrokers 


 such as Karzai's half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, head of the 


 Kandahar provincial council.



 Relatively unknown before U.S. forces arrived in 


 Afghanistan in fall 2001, Ruhullah is ''prototypical of a new 


 class of warlord in Afghanistan,'' the report said. Unlike 


 more traditional warlords, he has no political aspirations or 


 tribal standing but ''commands a small army of over 600 


 guards.''



 The ''single largest security provider for the U.S. supply 


 chain in Afghanistan,'' Ruhullah ''readily admits to bribing 


 governors, police chiefs and army generals,'' the report 


 said. In a meeting with congressional investigators in Dubai, 


 he complained about ''the high cost of ammunition in 


 Afghanistan--he says he spends $1.5 million per month on 


 rounds for an arsenal that includes AK-47s, heavy machine 


 guns and RPGs,'' or rocket-propelled grenades. It added: 


 ''Villagers along the road refer to him as 'the Butcher.' ''



 Despite his ''critical role,'' the report said, ''nobody 


 from the Department of Defense or the U.S. intelligence 


 community has ever met with him,'' other than special 


 operations forces who have twice arrested and released him, 


 and he ''is largely a mystery to both the U.S. government and 


 the contractors that employ his services.''



 Defense regulations and laws promulgated following 


 difficulties with private security contractors in Iraq limit 


 the weaponry that contractors can use and require detailed 


 incident reports every time shots are fired. But such reports 


 are rarely, if ever, filed, investigators said.



 Another trucking contractor described a ''symbiotic'' 


 relationship between security providers such as Ruhullah and 


 the Taliban, whose fighters operate in the same space, and 


 said that the Taliban is paid not to cause trouble for the 


 convoys. ''Many firefights are really negotiations over the 


 fee,'' the report said.



 Among its recommendations, the report calls on the military 


 to establish ''a direct line of authority and accountability 


 over the private security companies that guard the supply 


 chain'' and to provide ''the personnel and resources required 


 to manage and oversee its trucking and security contracts in 


 Afghanistan.''
