Mr. TANNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute 
to Colonel Darrell E. Adams, for 27 years of exceptional service and 
dedication to the United States Air Force. He will be retiring from 
active duty on September 30, 2009.

In his most recent assignment, he served as the Chief of the Strategy 
and Assessments Division, Secretary of the Air Force, Directorate of 
Public Affairs.

Colonel Adams grew up in McIntosh, Alabama. He entered the Air Force 
in 1982 as a distinguished graduate of the Reserve Officers' Training 
Corps at Alabama State University. Following undergraduate missile 
training, his operational assignments included duties as a Minuteman 
III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile crew commander at Grand Forks 
Air Force Base, North Dakota and Ground Launched Cruise Missile crew 
commander at Florennes Air Base, Belgium, during the period of the Cold 
War.

Colonel Adams has served in a variety of staff and leadership 
positions both stateside and overseas. He has been a training officer, 
protocol officer, command and control officer at the wing and 
Headquarters level. Most notably, he was the on-duty Senior Controller 
at Headquarters Fifteenth Air Force when President George H.W. Bush 
directed the nuclear stand-down for B-52 bombers, tanker aircraft, and 
missiles in promoting peace and stability between the United States and 
the Soviet Union. He has been a squadron commander, deputy group 
commander; he has two assignments as a congressional liaison officer.

Prior to his current assignment, Colonel Adams served as the Chief of 
the Congressional Inquiries Division, Office of Legislative Liaison. He 
managed on behalf of the Department of the Air Force, all constituent 
inquiries from the White House, Office of the Vice President, Members 
of Congress and state and local governments. He also managed the Air 
Force Legislative Fellowship program where selected Air Force officers 
served as Congressional Fellows on Capitol Hill.

Over the past 4 years Colonel Adams escorted many Members of Congress 
on Congressional Delegations, in furtherance of their oversight 
responsibilities. He assisted me and Members of the U.S. House 
delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly on multiple trips to 
Europe including Russia, Africa, and Afghanistan. The logistics of such 
trips are often complicated and require lengthy and detailed 
preparation. He always upheld the highest standards of professional 
conduct and his


thorough and efficient planning assured that these trips were a 
complete success. He will be missed.

I ask my Colleagues to join me in expressing our sincere thanks to 
Darrell, his wife Lisa, their daughter Regis, and their two sons Kalon 
and Jared, for their unwavering support of our country and the freedom 
we hold so dear. We congratulate Colonel Adams on the completion of an 
exemplary active-duty career and wish him well in the next phase of his 
life.
