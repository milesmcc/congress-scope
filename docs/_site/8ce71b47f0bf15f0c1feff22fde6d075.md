# FRAUD ENFORCEMENT AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2009--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `8ce71b47f0bf15f0c1feff22fde6d075`
`Mr. INHOFE â€” 20 April 2009`

---


Mr. INHOFE. The problem is that the left is focused on one number, 
one piece of military spending, when they need to look at the total 
defense budget--what DOD actually spends on military operations, and 
how that money is used to maintain our military capabilities.

In actuality, thanks to the Obama administration, our overall defense 
spending has been cut by $10.7 billion in fiscal 2009 and then cut 
again in 2010. You might say fiscal 2009 was from the previous 
administration. But the second part of the emergency supplemental is 
where the cuts came in, and that was done by the Obama administration.

We have reached a crossroads where we will choose to either invest in 
modernization and readiness of our military or mistakenly ''kick the 
can down the road,'' which we have been doing.

Based on the projected defense budget for the next 10 years, it looks 
as if this administration is taking us down a path that leads to a 
weaker military that is poorly equipped. Two weeks ago, on April 6, 
Secretary Gates announced a broad plan of cuts and adjustments in the 
fiscal year 2010 DOD


budget. His plan intends to ''reshape the priorities of America's 
defense establishment'' and ''profoundly reform how the DOD does 
business.''

However, the programs and systems he intends to cut will severely 
affect the ongoing effort to rebuild and modernize our military. I was 
in Afghanistan when this decision was announced. Most of the liberal 
journalists responded.

This plan comes at a time in our history when we have dramatically 
increased domestic spending by trillions of dollars under the umbrella 
of ''emergency bailouts'' and ''stimulus packages.''

Think about it. I think that $700 billion, quite frankly, was thrown 
away. It was supposed to be used for damaged assets and it was used to 
bail out friendly banks. I will defend Paulson a little, because it was 
Tim Geithner who was the architect behind all of this. I will elaborate 
on that later.

If you want to stimulate the economy, there are three ways to do it. 
One would be for military spending, defense spending; another is 
infrastructure investment--highways, construction, bridges--and another 
is tax cuts.

Sadly, this President is on track to grow the country's obligations 
to 22 percent of our GDP, while he is shrinking defense spending in 
relation to GDP to 3 percent in 2019.

This chart shows that during the Clinton administration, in the 
1990s, we took a holiday from the procurement of new weapons and 
modernizing the aging weapons systems. This black line is what he 
inherited in the beginning. If you add inflation to it, that is what it 
would have been. This line was the Clinton budget--$412 billion less 
than what normal inflation would be. It looks like that is where we are 
going from this point on.

Many of us in the Senate and in the House repeatedly spoke on the 
floor during the 1990s. We were concerned about the dangers of the 
massive cuts in personnel and procurement that were taking shape. With 
very few exceptions, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have 
been using the same weapons systems while fighting a two-fronted war on 
terror for 8 years. They are weapons and weapons systems designed and 
produced during the Cold War--weapons used repeatedly over the past two 
decades around the globe--weapons and weapon systems still in use 
today.

We have been unsuccessful in trying to get past a bow wave created in 
the 1990s, when the military budget was cut $412 billion and 
acquisition programs and research and development were pushed to the 
right--delayed.

The cost of kicking our military modernization down the road is a 
twofold increase in our cost to modernize--an increase to develop and 
field new weapons and weapon systems, and an increased cost to operate 
and maintain our aging equipment.

It is also forcing the military to accept more risk as they decide 
how to operate with less equipment, how to fight with equipment 
increasingly difficult to maintain, and what to do when weapon systems 
reach the end of their service life without an operational replacement.

The major combat systems that our troops use today are those 
developed and procured during the 1980s and, in some cases, going back 
to the 1950s.

The Reagan administration was handed a military that was a hollow 
force in many respects--low morale, low pay, outdated equipment, and 
unable to maintain the equipment it possessed. Ronald Reagan expanded 
the military budget, increased troop size, reenergized weapons 
procurement, and revived our intelligence capabilities, returning this 
country to its superpower status. He guaranteed the superiority of the 
U.S. military's weapon systems and capabilities through long-term 
investment and ensuring that our troops were provided with the most 
advanced equipment available.

As Secretary Gates said in January 2009, our military must be 
prepared for a ''full spectrum'' of operations, including the type of 
combat we are facing in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as large-scale 
threats that we face in places such as North Korea and Iran.

By the way, I don't blame Secretary Gates for all of this. He had to 
use the numbers that the Obama White House gave him.

Far too often we have learned the hard way that we don't have a 
crystal ball to precisely predict what types of national security 
threats the Nation will face. During a hearing in the House Armed 
Services Committee--this happened when I was on that committee in 1994. 
We had somebody testify who said that in 10 years we will no longer 
need ground troops. Look at this. After 7 years engaged in the war on 
terror, we know he was wrong. The strategic environment has become 
increasingly complex, dynamic, lethal, and uncertain.

Today, our military is fighting with equipment that is decades old 
and a force structure that is 40 percent less than what we had in the 
1980s.

The Air Force has 2,500 fewer aircraft. The Navy cut its fleet size 
in half; that is down to 300 ships. The Army reduced its force to half 
the number of divisions it had during the first gulf war.

For the past 17 years, our military has been asked to do more with 
much less and older equipment. It is taking a toll on our troops. 
Unfortunately, what took less than a decade to field in the 1980s will 
now take us multiple decades to field. A case in point: The KC-X, which 
will take up to 30 years to replace. We are using KC-135s for these 
capabilities. The KC-X program would have modernized that. In the case 
of the KC-135s, some are 50 years old. It gets to the point where the 
maintenance is more than buying something new.

The United States will have to build and sustain military 
capabilities required to respond to possible future threats across the 
spectrum of conflict, and there are numerous potential threats that 
could impact our national security.

The next war will not be like the last one. We cannot predict. You 
can talk to smart generals and ask what do we have to pay for 20 years 
from now, and they are smart, but they will be wrong, just like the 
guys who said we would no longer need ground troops in 10 years. We 
don't know.

In February of 2009, a marine general wrote to one of the young 
marines:




 You say the next conflict will be a guerrilla conflict. I 


 say, it depends. In my lifetime, we have been in five big 


 fights and a bunch of little ones. In only one of those 


 five big ones (Desert Storm) had we prepared for the type 


 of war we wound up having to fight. It is one thing to say 


 that a certain type of fight is more or less likely; it is 


 quite another to say it is certain to be one or the other. 


 In war, the only thing that is certain is uncertainty.


We weren't able to predict the fall of the Soviet Union, the rapid 
growth of the ballistic missile capability of North Korea, or the rise 
in asymmetric warfare. We were wrong in all of that. It doesn't matter 
how great our military leaders or intelligence are, our strategic 
thinking will always be imperfect.

In order to provide stability, America must be able to deter or 
defeat any threat, be it an insurgency or a challenge from a near-peer 
competitor.

We can no longer afford to fool ourselves that we are sending our 
kids out with the best of equipment. Quite often, I talk to people who 
are really not into this. They are working hard and paying taxes for 
all this fun we are having up here. When you tell them that our kids 
are going out there without the very best of equipment, they are 
outraged. They cannot believe it. Unfortunately, that is the case.

Let's do the math that they are so critical of. As I said, we need to 
look at the total defense budget, everything DOD spends. This includes 
national defense funds, DOD funds, DOE funds for nuclear ships and 
weapons, and other defense-related items, such as selective service 
system, plus the wartime supplemental.

First, there is a net loss in defense spending in 2009 of $10.7 
billion. President Bush increased the total defense budget in 2009 by 
$37.2 billion. He also approved $65.9 billion in supplemental funds for 
the first part of fiscal 2009.

President Obama's supplemental request for defense spending is only 
$75.5 billion to cover an increase of 21,000 troops in Afghanistan, 
increased operations in Afghanistan, continued operations in Iraq, and 
then withdrawing from Iraq. A GOP report on the cost of Iraq withdrawal 
said it will be a ''massive and expensive effort''--that costs would 
more often increase in the near term. What they are saying is that 
these things were not included in Obama's budget, but we will pay for 
them anyway. So he comes out with a


figure that he says is going to be more costly.

They went on to say that the cost of equipment repairs, replacements, 
closing and turning over 283 military installations in Iraq and moving 
troops and equipment ''will likely be significant.'' This is what we 
call the cost of withdrawal.

Let's compare 2009 to 2010, where I have been accused of not being 
able to do the math. Defense spending does increase from 2009 to 2010 
by $14.9 billion. But according to President Obama's letter to Speaker 
Pelosi on April 9, there will be no more supplementals.

That would mean DOD would have to fund all wartime operations out of 
the hide of DOD to the tune of about $100 billion plus.

However, President Obama does fence off $130 billion for overseas 
contingency funds, which could be used for getting out of Iraq and 
increased operations in Afghanistan.

Even adding the entire $130 billion to defense spending, which is 
never the case with supplemental funding, the overall increase in 
defense spending for 2010 is $3.5 billion.

If we estimate 2 percent inflation for cost growth of just the 
defense budget, defense spending actually decreases by $7.3 billion.

Now, add in the accelerated growth of the Army and Marine Corps--a 
65,000 and 22,000 increase, respectively, which will cost approximately 
$13 billion to cover pay and health care costs, and you start to see 
the beginnings of how our military modernization gets gutted.

DOD must pay for personnel, operations and maintenance, ongoing 
wartime and contingency operations. With a zero supplemental fund, the 
money to pay for these ''must pays''--the things we have to buy--has to 
be taken from DOD's base budget, and the areas that are always hit are 
R&D and acquisition.

Look at what is being cut. If you question what I am saying here in 
terms of dropping down the costs, look at the programs we have to have 
that they are cutting. They are eliminating future combat systems. This 
is something we started putting together 8 years ago--the first 
transformation of ground operations and capabilities in probably 30 
years. The C-17s--we need more of them. They have cut the additional C-
17s. And the F-22--I am proud that we finally bit the bullet and 
realized we want to send our kids out in strike vehicles that are 
better than the ones they are making in Russia. That is the F-22, the 
fifth generation. They have stopped that.

Originally, we were going to have some 750 F-22s. Now they are 
stopping it in this budget at 187. So historical defense spending as a 
percentage of GDP has been 3 percent during the Clinton drawdown; 4.6 
percent during the gulf war; 6 percent during the Reagan buildup; 8.9 
percent during the Vietnam war; 11.7 percent during the Korean war; and 
about 35 percent during World War II.

When compared to a sustained annual defense investment of 4 percent 
of the GDP to recapitalize and modernize our military, the 10-year 
proposed Obama defense budget is $1.3 trillion in the red.

We have a similar chart that we had here during the Clinton 
administration. One thing the Obama defense budget guarantees is that 
the oldest military in the history of the Nation will get older and 
more expensive to maintain and operate.

Ships currently average 18 years; Naval aircraft averages 18 years; 
Marine Corps aircraft, 21 years. Refueling tankers are over 44 years 
old; Air Force fighter aircraft, 19 years old; special operations 
aircraft, over 27 years old; and bomber aircraft, over 33 years old.

In order to keep 40-year-old KC-135s, as I mentioned a minute ago, in 
the air, DOD has to reprogram almost $3 billion from the KC-X program 
to repair KC-135s. That means the program that was there to pay for 
modernizing, to buy new aircraft--the KC-X it is termed--now we are 
drawing down from that just to repair the old, ancient KC-135s.

In the Army, the current fleet of combat vehicles was developed and 
procured 30 to 60 years ago and is aging at an increasingly rapid rate. 
The M1 Abrams tank developed in the 1970s and fielded in the eighties 
is currently on its third iteration and update and being used 
extensively on the battlefield.

The M2 Bradley fighting vehicle, also developed over 25 years ago, is 
on its third significant modification and has been crucial in defending 
our troops against IED and RPG threats in Iraq.

Both of these combat-proven vehicles continue to undergo fleetwide 
reset programs because of their rate of use in the war on terror.

The oldest combat vehicle in the Army inventory is the Paladin 
Howitzer. This is kind of interesting because this is part of the FCS 
and is the furthest along right now in its development. The Paladin 
technology is World War II technology. Every time you fire it, you have 
to get out and swab the breech. There are now five countries, including 
South Africa, that make a better cannon than our kids are using.

Over 19,000 artillery rounds were shot from the Paladins in Iraq in 
2008; over 27,000 were shot in 2007. Despite some parochial criticism 
in the media and in this Congress, the fact remains that the U.S. Army 
is using a system developed over 50 years ago.

By the way, people accuse me of doing something that is parochial. If 
we look at the footprint that was given by the lead systems integrator, 
it shows Oklahoma in the bottom 20 in terms of getting funding for the 
FCS program.

Our artillery soldiers are using this system that has a chassis 
design that is a half century old and slated to undergo its seventh 
modification. Let me say at this point that I believe the defense 
budget should at the very least continue the PIM Program--the Paladin 
Integrated Management Program--just to keep those vehicles going. We 
should keep the FCS on track but don't dump the PIM Program with the 
FCS Program.

Even with the implementation of the PIM update, the Army expects to 
keep the Paladin in use until 2060. That is 100 years on the 
battlefield. Our Army is long overdue a thorough and comprehensive 
modernization program instead of throwing billions of dollars toward 
updating and maintaining decades-old vehicle platforms.

The proposed defense budget would cancel the manned vehicle portion 
of the Army's Future Combat System, the modernization program intended 
to replace the Paladin, Abrams, and the Bradley over the next 25 years.

The FCS vehicles would bring improved armor, a state-of-the-art 
communications network. These are life-and-death issues. These are our 
troops on the ground being able to have something that is actually 
better than our prospective enemies. That is what we are losing in this 
defense budget.

The Air Force: For nearly two decades, our U.S. Air Force has 
dominated the skies to ensure our superiority around the world. 
However, the most recent GAO study stated that the Air Sovereignty 
Alert Operations--the post-9/11 operations that protect our homeland--
are at risk during aging aircraft and insufficient procurement.

The Air Force grounded 259 of its 441 F-15 Eagles in November to 
January while it looked into the breakup of an F-15C.

Last May, the service parked all 500 of its T-38 trainers. Last 
October, the Air Force ordered more than half of the 356 A-10 fighters 
to stay put because of cracks in the wings.

While we have enjoyed the benefit of the investment during the 1980s 
of the F-15, F-16, A-10, and the F-117s, the F-117 is now retired and 
the Air Force will be retiring 137 of the F-15s, 177 of the F-16s, and 
several of the A-10s.

What we are saying is, we are already shutting down and the only way 
to replace them, if we are going to have a fifth generation strike 
vehicle, is with the F-22. We are supposed to have 750 of these F-22s. 
This budget stops the line at 187. That means if something comes along 
and we have a more responsible, defense-oriented administration coming 
in, they would have to start up the line, and it will cost much more.

This is being done at a time when Secretary Gates told reporters that 
the intelligence he has seen indicates a Russian fifth generation 
fighter could become operational about 2016, and previous estimates by 
the Pentagon on China's J-12 fifth generation fighter could be fielded 
by 2020.

Increasing the number of F-35s is not going to do it; the functions 
are different; their missions are different.



The Navy: At a time when it is being called on to project a presence 
in more parts of the world than ever before, Secretary Gates has 
recommended the Navy shrink its carrier fleet to 10 aircraft carriers 
by 2012 and delay the acquisition of other portions of the fleet.

This reduction of the aircraft carriers goes further below the 
previous QDR. That is the Quadrennial Defense Review. They stated 20 
carriers would be required for moderate risk. When they use ''moderate 
risk,'' we are talking about lives of our soldiers, sailors, and 
airmen.

In the last 3 weeks, we have seen how relevant and important the Navy 
is while watching the various pirate activities off Somalia and some of 
those activities that are going on now. We did not realize we needed to 
do that prior to that time. It shows how fluid this is in terms of our 
expectations and our needs.

China, Japan, Australia, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Indonesia, 
Singapore, Bangladesh, South and North Korea either now have or are 
planning to acquire submarines to compete with ours.

In all, the Navy would be left with less than 300 ships, and that is 
about half of what it was during the eighties.

Missile defense: I am going to run out of time. I should have had 
this on before. On February 3, we all know, Iran launched a satellite 
on the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution, demonstrating 
key technologies for propulsion, staging, and so forth.

Two weeks ago, North Korea furthered their missile and nuclear 
development by launching the Taepodong 2 missile in the South China 
Sea, despite widespread world condemnation. Despite this, the 
administration has recommended a 16-percent cut in missile defense. It 
is interesting, this would come along right at the time of the 26th 
anniversary when Ronald Reagan put SDI together, recognizing, so 
prophetically when we were going to have a system, the technology to 
hit a bullet with a bullet. We have it now.

We told the Czech Republic and Poland that we will be supporting 
them, putting together a radar and launch system. Now they don't know 
what we want because that also has either been delayed or canceled. I 
suggest it has been canceled.

By the way, if Iran develops the capability of doing something from 
Iran and aiming toward Western Europe, this is the only safeguard we 
would have. The Czech Republic and Poland have gone along with us, and 
now we are pulling the rug out from under them.

The last point I wish to make is on the Airborne Laser Program. I 
wish there was time to explain this program. There are three phases. 
You have the launch phase, midcourse phase, and terminal phase. These 
phases are necessary for a national missile defense system.

I agree we need to do something on the acquisition processes. We have 
been trying to do it for a long period of time. However, acquisition 
reform should be done in conjunction with, not in lieu of, modernizing 
and properly equipping our Armed Forces to dominate across the full 
spectrum of warfare.

I have stated many times in this Chamber that the greatest trust 
placed in Congress by the American people is to provide for their 
security by maintaining a strong national defense. We can avoid this 
far too frequent debate on defense budgeting by assuring a minimal 
level of funding for our military.

I believe when you talk to the average man on the street as to what 
is the primary function of Government, that function should be to 
defend America, and that is the threat we are facing now. Somehow this 
has taken a back seat to what we are supposed to be doing.

As the Congress considers the administration's budget recommendations 
in the coming weeks, we have to ask several questions: Are the forces 
being provided to our commanders in the field postured to counter the 
full spectrum of threats? Are we providing our troops with the best and 
most capable equipment available? Certainly we are not today. And can 
we afford to kick the can down the road further? The answer is a 
resounding no.

Finally, the total cost for 2010 to reach this expectation would 
require an increase of $28 billion in 2010. With the Obama budget of 
social welfare that will triple the public debt in 10 years, we have 
already spent almost $2 trillion. Mr. President, the $700 billion of a 
bank bailout we now know is Tim Geithner's plan to start with, and in 
October of 2008, we gave $700 billion to an unelected bureaucrat to do 
with as he wished with no oversight whatsoever.

I have to say this is the time when we look at the amount of money 
that is being spent on all the social welfare programs and say: Why not 
defend America? Clearly, that is not the primary goal of this 
administration.

I think my fellow Oklahoma Congressman, Tom Cole, said it best. He 
said: President Obama's charm and eloquence is no substitute for a 
strong national defense.

I believe that is right. I hope we have a chance to relook at this 
and make adjustments.

I also remind the administration, you can come out with all these 
cuts, cutting the F-22s and the Future Combat System and the C-17s and 
the national missile defense system, but that still has to go through. 
And thank God we have three branches of Government so we will be able 
to get the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services 
Committee to review this and try to put America back in a position 
where its primary goal is to defend America. That is what this is all 
about.














EPA Endangerment Finding


I am very troubled by the EPA proposed endangerment finding that will 
unleash a torrent of regulations that will destroy jobs, harm 
consumers, and extend the Agency's reach into every corner of American 
life. Despite enormous expense and hardship for the American economy, 
these regulations will have virtually no effect on climate change.

It now appears EPA's regulatory reach will find its way into schools, 
hospitals, assisted living facilities, and just about any activity that 
meets minimum thresholds in the Clean Air Act. Representative John 
Dingell was right: the endangerment finding will produce a ''glorious 
mess.'' ''It is worth noting that the solution to this ''glorious 
mess'' is not for Congress to pass cap-and-trade legislation, which 
replaces one very bad approach with another.

Congress should pass a simple, narrowly targeted bill that stops EPA 
in its tracks.















 gun treaty support


Next, we discovered that President Obama, in his announcement last 
week, plans to urge the Senate to ratify the Inter-American Convention 
Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, 
Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials, known by the 
acronym CIFTA.

The idea that American-manufactured firearms are responsible for the 
growing violence in Mexico is not grounded in reality, but the Obama 
administration is using this violence as justification to require 
stricter licensing requirements and markings on firearms by U.S. 
manufacturers. The majority of the gun violence that is occurring in 
the drug wars in Mexico is the result of assault weapons, including 
fully automatic versions, which are not even available for sale in the 
United States. Many of these weapons are coming from other countries in 
Central and South America and deserters from the Mexican military.

I am strongly opposed to placing more stringent requirements on U.S. 
gun manufacturers, especially when the evidence shows that they are not 
the problem. This is an instance of the Obama administration using 
alternative means to place greater regulations on the manufacture and 
sale of legal firearms in the United States. I believe that my 
colleagues in the Senate understand this to be the case and will do as 
they have for the last 10 years and not ratify this treaty.





 Letter to DHS Expressing Outrage over Controversial Report


I was shocked to learn of a new report by the Department of Homeland 
Security entitled ''Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political 
Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment'' which 
classifies the brave men and women returning home from combat and 
operational deployments around


the globe, who have been honorably defending our country, as potential 
terrorists.

As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am 
especially proud of our soldiers returning home, and I find it 
extremely regretful that they have been subjected to such an insult by 
this report. Furthermore, I find it reprehensible that within this 
report Americans who hold certain beliefs regarding issues such as 
immigration, the second amendment, and abortion fall under the report's 
broad generalization of rightwing extremists, and are, therefore, 
considered a potential threat. I believe this report to be very 
offensive to many Americans.

As a result, I joined Senators Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, David Vitter 
of Louisiana, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Jim DeMint of South Carolina, 
Richard Burr of North Carolina, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to send a 
letter to Secretary Janet Napolitano expressing concerns.
















 david hamilton


Mr. President, I am not impressed with President Obama's judiciary 
and Department of Justice nominees. Eric Holder, David Ogden, Dawn 
Johnsen, Elena Kagan, and Thomas Perelli are all extreme liberals in 
their views on everything from the second amendment to abortion to 
pornography and obscenity. I applauded when President Obama kept 
Secretary Gates on as his Defense Secretary, and I really hoped that he 
would choose other individuals who were at least moderate in their 
political ideology, but that just has not been the case.

Just prior to recess, my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee 
boycotted the nomination hearing of David Hamilton to sit on the 
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. A hearing was scheduled a mere 2 
weeks after the announcement of his nomination. Senator Specter and 
seven of my other Republican colleagues requested another hearing after 
the spring recess, citing a Senate rule that allows a majority of the 
minority side of the committee to request a followup. Many remember 
David Hamilton because of his 2005 decision as a Federal district court 
judge presiding over the case Hinrichs v. Bosmah, in which he enjoined 
the Speaker of Indiana's House of Representatives from permitting 
''sectarian'' prayers to be offered as part of that body's official 
proceedings, meaning that the chaplain or whomever opened the 
proceedings with prayer could not invoke the name of Jesus Christ. In 
his conclusion, Hamilton wrote: ''If the Speaker chooses to continue 
any form of legislative prayer, he shall advise persons offering such a 
prayer (a) that it must be nonsectarian and must not be used to 
proselytize or advance any one faith or belief or to disparage any 
other faith or belief, and (b) that they should refrain from using 
Christ's name or title or any other denominational appeal.'' Further, 
ruling on a postjudgment motion, Hamilton stated that invoking the name 
of ''Allah'' would not advance a particular religion or disparage 
another. So, praying to Allah would be perfectly acceptable. I find 
this line of reasoning to be insane. Who in this body would not 
identify the name of ''Allah'' with the religion of Islam any less than 
they would identify the name of Jesus with Christianity? But I believe 
these are the kind of opinions we may see coming from the Seventh 
Circuit if David Hamilton is confirmed. I understand that Judge 
Hamilton's nomination is still pending before the Judiciary Committee, 
but I had to come to the floor to speak so that the American people, 
who are very concerned about this nomination, will know that I and my 
Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee are taking interest 
and are not just going to let this nomination sail through. In fact I 
will filibuster David Hamilton.

I would also like to speak for a moment on a couple of the nominees 
that we will be voting on this evening. Tony West, the nominee for 
Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division served as cocounsel 
for John Walker Lindh. As you all know, Lindh joined the Taliban and 
fought against our very own American soldiers in the liberation of 
Afghanistan. Lindh is a traitor and terrorist, but after a plea deal 
that Mr. West helped obtain, he is only serving 20 years in prison.

Lanny Breuer, the Assistant Attorney General nominee for the Criminal 
Division, helped obtain a great plea deal for Sandy Berger, who 
admitted to stealing classified documents from the National Archives. 
He received a $50,000 fine, probation, and community service. I 
understand that every criminal defendant is entitled to representation 
and that it was the duty of these men to vigorously represent their 
clients' interests, but it is also the choice of this administration 
who they nominate to these positions, and I truly believe that better 
choices could have been made.
















 Exhibit 1











 The Pentagon's New Priorities




 Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a man not known for having 


 his head in the stars, announced his strategic Pentagon 


 blueprint this week, saying his proposals ''will profoundly 


 reform how this department does business.'' We hope he 


 informed Congress, home to 535 procurers in chief.



 The Defense procurement system is a mess, and previous 


 Pentagon reforms have faltered thanks mostly to the 


 micromanagers on Capitol Hill who are often more interested 


 in funneling money to their home states than in spending 


 dollars most effectively. Democrats and Republicans both 


 belly up to this bar, usually while castigating the executive 


 branch for failing to make ''tough choices.''



 So give the Defense Secretary an A for optimistic effort, 


 even if we have our disagreements with some of his strategic 


 choices. In announcing his spending priorities, Mr. Gates 


 said he wants to focus on the current wars in Iraq and 


 Afghanistan, rather than on the unknown wars of the future. 


 Among his cuts are the Army's Future Combat Systems and a 


 gold-plated new Presidential helicopter that is late and way 


 over budget. Meanwhile, he added money for unmanned aerial 


 vehicles, increased the number of special forces and 


 announced plans to recruit more cyberwarfare experts.



 These seem like reasonable judgment calls, and the focus on 


 combating asymmetrical threats will help the U.S. in Iraq and 


 Afghanistan. But it's worth remembering that the reason our 


 enemies have resorted to terrorism and insurgency is because 


 U.S. conventional forces overwhelmingly dominate on the 


 ground, in the sea and in the air.



 That's not an advantage we can take for granted as the 


 Clinton Administration did in the 1990s, when it slashed 


 defense spending to 3% from nearly 5% of GDP. China and 


 Russia are upgrading their conventional forces, and China in 


 particular is aiming to build a navy that can neutralize U.S. 


 forces in the Western Pacific.



 Mr. Gate's strategy implies a shrinking Navy with fewer 


 ships and perhaps one fewer carrier group. It's good that he 


 wants to build more Littoral Combat Ships, which are handy 


 for operations such as tracing pirates. Even so, the Navy is 


 left with a fleet of fewer than 300 ships, which strikes us 


 as perilously small. When a U.S.-flagged container ship 


 was briefly taken by pirates off Somalia this week, the 


 Navy's nearest vessel was hours away.



 Mr. Gates's decision to kill the stealthy F-22 fighter jet, 


 which outclasses everything in the sky, is also troubling. We 


 already have 183 F-22s--original plans called for 750--and 


 Mr. Gates wants to order just four more before shutting down 


 the production line. His proposal to double the number of F-


 35 Joint Strike Fighters and Pentagon buys next year--to 30 


 from 14 in 2009--is no quid pro quo. The F-35 is a cheaper, 


 more multipurpose plane but it can't begin to compete with 


 the F-22 as a fighter jet.



 Pentagon spending is now about 4% of GDP and is expected to 


 decline, which means too little investment against potential 


 threats. In particular, Mr. Gates's budget priorities give no 


 indication of how the Pentagon will ensure that U.S. military 


 dominance extends to the battlefield of the future, outer 


 space. President Obama has said he opposes the 


 ''militarization of space,'' but space is already a crucial 


 area of operations and China is looking for advantages there.



 The $1.4 billion in cuts to missile defense are especially 


 worrisome, with losers including the Airborne Laser, designed 


 to shoot down ballistic missiles in the boost phase, and 


 additional interceptors planned for the ground-based system 


 in Alaska. Instead, Mr. Gates favors theater defenses for 


 soldiers on the battlefield with $700 million more in 


 funding, arguing that this will address the near-term threat 


 of short-range missiles. But as North Korea's weekend launch 


 showed, rogue regimes aren't far away from securing long-


 range missiles that could reach the U.S.



 Mr. Gates shrewdly made no budget recommendations on 


 nuclear forces, except to say that he'll defer judgment until 


 after the forthcoming Nuclear Posture Review. Perhaps he's 


 counting on being able to change President Obama's mind on 


 the need for updating U.S. strategic weapons and going 


 forward with the Reliable Replacement Warhead for America's 


 aging nuclear arsenal.



 Mr. Gates's budget proposals now go to Congress. Since the 


 end of World War II there have been more than 130 studies on 


 procurement reform. Good luck.
