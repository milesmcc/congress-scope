Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Dr. Gingrey is exactly right. And I want to 
know what this $1.5 billion or $2 billion that the President has 
proposed to spend on this flu outbreak is going to be spent on? Is it 
going to be a useful expenditure? Is it going to be needed?

We saw in 1976 under President Ford when they spent all that money 
that actually caused more harm than good. More people died and had 
disease from the vaccine. Now, we have better technology; in fact, the 
gentleman at the University of Georgia has just some outstanding 
technology today where they can help develop vaccines very quickly. But 
still, it takes a while to produce enough vaccines to be able to help 
if they are needed. And what we see in this particular flu outbreak is 
that I don't think they are needed. I don't think we need to be 
appropriating $1.5 billion or $2 billion for the H1N1 flu. We need to 
give those funds to our military personnel to keep them from dying in 
Afghanistan or Iraq.
