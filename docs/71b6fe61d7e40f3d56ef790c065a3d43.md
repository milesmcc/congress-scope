`Mr. HASTINGS of Florida â€” 29 September 2010`

Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my colleague on the Rules Committee, 
my good friend Mr. Arcuri.

Mr. Speaker, as vice chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence, I know that the intelligence community is the first 
line of defense against terrorists, proliferators of weapons of mass 
destruction, and other rogue elements who wish to do us harm here at 
home and across the globe. This legislation, for the first time since 
2004, is an opportunity for the Congress to guide the 16 agencies of 
the intelligence community while making significant strides in 
improving oversight of the intelligence community.

I have had the honor and privilege of meeting many of our 
intelligence professionals during my oversight travel as a member of 
the Intelligence Committee. I cannot overstate how much I appreciate 
and am humbled by their service.

The past year has been a busy one for the intelligence community. 
There have been some very low points, including the loss of seven brave 
Americans in an attack on the CIA in Afghanistan and the attack on 
Northwest Airlines flight 253. At the same time, there have been some 
high points, like the roll-up of the Russian illegal intelligence 
operation and the significant intelligence gained by the FBI and DOJ in 
several counterterrorism cases. But the danger is as high as it ever 
was. Our enemies are motivated to strike us, as they always have been. 
The constant threat from violent extremists reinforces that now more 
than ever. We must give the intelligence community the resources and 
flexibility it needs to thwart the continuing and emerging threats to 
U.S. national security.

Since 2004, this country has gone without an intelligence 
authorization bill. Each year the House Intelligence Committee has 
passed a bill, but we have not seen one signed into law in recent 
years. The intelligence community needs strong and independent 
oversight. This bill would make great strides in that direction. First, 
it would create a statutory Inspector General for the entire 
intelligence community. This bill also contains a new provision that I 
believe the chairman talked about in reforming the ''Gang of Eight'' 
process. I believe that the administration has a statutory and 
constitutional duty to keep members of the entire intelligence 
community fully informed, and this bill, for the first time, requires 
all members of the intelligence community to get information about all 
covert actions.

The bill also traces the challenges of GAO access to the intelligence 
community, a priority subject for many of my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle. It directs the DNI, in conjunction with the Comptroller 
General, to issue a written directive governing GAO access to 
information in possession of the intelligence community.

In my tenure, Mr. Speaker, on the committee, I have consistently 
pushed for greater diversity in the intelligence community. I have 
stated time and again that the intelligence community is not diverse 
enough to do its job of stealing and analyzing foreign countries' 
secrets.
