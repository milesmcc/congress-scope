Mr. DeFAZIO. Vice President Cheney, in his usual arrogant way, 
refused to disclose the deliberations of his secret energy task force 
that gave billions to big oil and increased our dependence on OPEC. He 
claimed executive privilege.

Then his office illegally disclosed the identity of a secret 
undercover CIA officer, Valerie Plame. They claimed executive 
privilege.

Now, we find that the Vice President is mishandling classified 
information in volumes in violation of Executive Branch regulations. 
And we have the astonishing assertion that the Vice President is not 
part of the executive branch. Rip up those civics text books kids. Dick 
Cheney is above the law and the Constitution of the United States, 
according to his attorney. Or perhaps he's just that higher power that 
George Bush refers to every time he has to make a difficult decision 
like launching an unneeded war in Iraq.
