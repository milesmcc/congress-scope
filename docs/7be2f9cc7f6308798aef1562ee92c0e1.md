Mr. KUCINICH. America is in the fight of its life. And the fight is 
not in Afghanistan; it's here. We're deeply in debt. Our GDP is down; 
our manufacturing is down; our savings are down; the value of the 
dollar is down. Our trade deficit is up; business failures are up; 
bankruptcies are up; foreign borrowing is up.

The war is a threat to our national security. We'll spend over $100 
billion next year to bomb a nation of poor people while we reenergize 
the Taliban, destabilize Pakistan, deplete our Army, and put more 
soldiers' lives on the line.

Meanwhile, back here in the USA, 15 million people out of work; 
people losing their jobs, their health care, their savings, their 
investments, their retirement security; $13 trillion in bailouts for 
Wall Street, trillions for war.

When are we going to start taking care of things here at home?
