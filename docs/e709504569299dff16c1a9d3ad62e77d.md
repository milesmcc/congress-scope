Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding, and I would like to 
congratulate him not only for his amendment, but also for the comments 
that the former Governor of Delaware has just offered on the work of 
the Iraq Study Group.

Again, this was a bipartisan effort that was launched by the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), who, as we all know, speaks 
passionately and eloquently on this and other issues.

We all want to see this war come to an end. President Bush stood 
right here in this Chamber in January delivering his State of the Union 
message, and he said the following: I wish this war was over and we had 
won.

So there is a shared goal of our trying to bring this war to an end 
as quickly as possible and to bring our men and women home to their 
families.

Frankly, I join my colleague from Delaware in stating that I believe 
that the opportunity for implementation, if not all, most of the work 
of the Iraq Study Group, this great bipartisan gathering, would go a 
long way towards achieving that goal to which both Democrats and 
Republicans claim to aspire.

So I would just like to thank my friend for his remarks, and I thank 
him for yielding to me.
