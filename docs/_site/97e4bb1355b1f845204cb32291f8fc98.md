Mr. SAXTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Hunter, for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, one of the provisions that is contained in this en bloc 
amendment is a provision that will help provide a higher level of 
security for our military personnel in the continental United States. 
As most of you probably read in the newspaper, a terrorist cell was 
apprehended in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, a short time ago.

They had been planning a small arms attack on soldiers, Reservists, 
actually, who were preparing to be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan at 
Fort Dix.

One of the elements of this planning involved a pizza delivery man. 
The pizza delivery man would access the base to deliver pizza to 
soldiers in the


evening who had completed their day's training.

As the apprehension was made, it was disclosed that this individual 
had actually entered onto the base, memorized the roads and the 
buildings on the base, and had actually drawn a map to provide to the 
other members of the cell who would take part in the attack.

This provision that's in this en bloc amendment would provide some 
extra tools for base commanders to be sure that people who enter onto 
Federal installations would have a background check done through the 
FBI, as well as through the Department of Homeland Security where 
immigration records are kept.

I want to thank Mr. Andrews for his high level of cooperation on 
this, and also to express my thanks to the chairman for agreeing to 
make this provision part of this en bloc amendment.

I understand there are some questions about it. Mr. Andrews and I, I 
won't speak for him, as we work through this, between now and the time 
we get a conference report, there may be some changes that are 
necessary. The last thing we want to do is to unduly restrict civilian 
activities, legitimate civilian activities on and around military 
bases.

So I look forward to working with the chairman, the ranking member 
and Mr. Andrews and others who may be interested to make sure that we 
do not do something that is harmful to morale or stymies activities on 
or around military bases.
