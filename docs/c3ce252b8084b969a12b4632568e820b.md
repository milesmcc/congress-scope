Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment. The Senate, in a significant vote, voted to get to the heart 
of the matter, the draw of jobs and those who offer them illegally. 
That is where the whole issue is. The Senate acted intelligently in 
that respect. It was tough and smart. But under the Sessions amendment, 
we are going to deploy another 6,000 National Guard, without 
conditions, to the border at a time in which we are overstretched with 
the National Guard in Iraq, Afghanistan, and for challenges that States 
have for emergencies in their own States. We are going to go ahead and 
deputize local police in local departments. I believe that is a 
mistake. We have had these before. They have not succeeded. We 
succeeded in passing an amendment that is going to be tough and smart 
and deal with the heart of the matter--employers who illegally hire 
people. It will make sure they get sanctioned, make sure we proceed 
against those who have Federal contracts doing this and makes sure we 
get rid of criminal aliens in the jails--local, State and Federal. That 
is the way to pursue it.

Vote against the Sessions amendment.
