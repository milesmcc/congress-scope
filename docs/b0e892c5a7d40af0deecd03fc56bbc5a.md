`Mr. ROTHMAN â€” 22 April 2008`

---


Mr. ROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 
322, which celebrates the 60th anniversary of the Jewish State of 
Israel's independence and reaffirms the friendship between the U.S. and 
Israel. I want to thank the Speaker and the Minority Leader for 
sponsoring this legislation, as well as the Chairman and Ranking Member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee for bringing it to the Floor so 
quickly.

On May 14, 2008, Israel will celebrate the 60th anniversary of Yom 
Ha'atzmaut, or the declaration of the State of Israel by David Ben-
Gurion in Tel Aviv on May 14, 1948. While this date traditionally 
celebrates Israel's birth as a pluralistic democracy--the only one in 
the Middle East--this date also marks 60 years of strong and vibrant 
U.S.-Israel relations, 60 years of Israel's success as one of the most 
technologically advanced countries in the world, and 60 years of Israel 
struggling to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing Palestinian-
Israeli conflict.

The U.S.-Israel relationship that we celebrate today is grounded in 
centuries-old American regard for Israel as the homeland of the Jewish 
people. This was so brilliantly discussed in Michael Oren's latest book 
''Power, Faith, and Fantasy,'' which describes American support for 
Israel as the homeland for the Jewish people starting before the 
American Revolution and being a strong element in U.S. foreign policy 
ever since.

But while this historic connection is true, Israel's value to the 
U.S. as a military and economic partner is also incredibly important. 
For the last 60 years, Israel has been America's number one ally in an 
extraordinarily strategic region for the United States--she is, in many 
ways, our ''forward battleship of democracy'' in a sea of 
totalitarians, terrorists, and murderous thugs. Just appreciate the 
fact that the United States spends $150 billion a year in Iraq in order 
to have 165,000 U.S. combat troops stationed there. Without Israel--God 
forbid--the United States might


well need to have 100,000 or more troops stationed permanently in that 
part of the world to protect U.S. strategic interests.

There are literally hundreds more examples of how Israel has helped 
the United States since its founding in 1948 in matters of 
intelligence, improving American military equipment, capturing Soviet 
and Russian equipment, destroying the Iraqi nuclear reactor, 
obliterating the Syrian nuclear facility, and a thousand more 
classified instances where Israel provided literally invaluable 
assistance to the United States in ways that no other country on the 
planet could do or has done.

For myriad reasons, the United States could not ask for a better 
friend and ally in the region than the State of Israel. The Israeli 
people know they will always be able to count on the U.S. and the 
American people. Whether or not the Palestinians ever become a true 
partner for peace to the Israelis--and I certainly hope that they do--
the United States will continue to stand by the Jewish State of Israel 
and make sure it has the qualitative military edge and superior force 
to defend itself against all enemies.

Once again, I extend my best wishes and congratulations to the people 
of the State of Israel on their 60th Independence Day and urge my 
colleagues to join with me in strong support of H. Con. Res. 322.
