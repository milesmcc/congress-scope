 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the arrival 
of the first F-117 Nighthawk fighters at Holloman Air Force Base, NM, 
15 years ago today.

On May 9, 1992, with the arrival of its first four F-117s at Holloman 
Air Force Base, the 49th fighter wing became the sole operator of the 
F-117. The F-117 was the world's first stealth aircraft and is still 
one of the world's most advanced fighters. Since that date the men and 
women of the 49th have flown the F-117 with distinction throughout the 
world. In 1999 the F-117s of the 49th deployed in support of Operation 
Allied Force, and flew more than 1,000 missions against heavily 
defended targets in Serbia. The 49th also played a key role in the 
opening hours of Operation Iraqi Freedom, attacking critical leadership 
targets.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those at Holloman 
for keeping the F-117 flying, and for their service to our Nation. I am 
proud New Mexico has been the home to this amazing aircraft and the 
outstanding individuals who fly them.
