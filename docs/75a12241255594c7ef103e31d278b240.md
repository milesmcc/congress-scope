# SONG TITLES FOR 110TH CONGRESS
## `75a12241255594c7ef103e31d278b240`
`Mr. WESTMORELAND â€” 23 March 2007`

Mr. WESTMORELAND. You know, Mr. Speaker, Alan Jackson lives in my 
district, a great country singer, and I was thinking of some songs for 
him. One of them was ''I Would Rather Be in New York Raising Money Than 
Funding the War in Iraq.'' The other one was ''How I Turned the Blue 
Dogs Yellow.''

Then there is also an author in my district, Ferrell Sams; he writes 
a lot of books; you may have read some of them, but a good book is 
''How to Lose a War and Store Peanuts.''

Let me say this, Mr. Speaker, for Alan Jackson to look at the rules. 
And he could do a whole album on the rules here. ''We Only Change Them 
When We Have To'' would make a great title for that rules album. ''We 
Only Leave the Vote Open When We Are Losing, When the Time is Up,'' 
would be another good one. And the last one would be, ''We Only Change 
Them When We Have To.''
