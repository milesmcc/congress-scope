# ORDER OF PROCEDURE
## `7627e8fe8edfd7b84caa63c146b3873d`
`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 15 March 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of the majority 
leader with regard to the painstaking process he and I have been 
through over the last day and a half trying to reach an agreement on 
the Iraq debate. I think it is an agreement that is satisfactory to 
both sides. It gives Senators an opportunity to express themselves on 
what is clearly, arguably, the most important issue on the minds of the 
American people at this particular juncture in our history, and we look 
forward to the debate starting shortly. Senator Inhofe will be here to 
control the time on our side, so let the debate begin.
