Mr. REID. Mr. President, today, the Senate has completed the 
amendment process on H.R. 2, and the Senate also invoked cloture on the 
bill by a vote of 88 to 8. Tomorrow, we will anticipate concluding 
action on the bill in the afternoon. Once the bill has been completed, 
there will then be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. Con. 
Res. 2, the bipartisan Iraq resolution, unless we work something out, 
as we expressed here at some length tonight.

To remind Members, we will be voting tomorrow prior to noon on three 
judicial nominations. Those votes are expected to begin at about 11:55 
a.m.
