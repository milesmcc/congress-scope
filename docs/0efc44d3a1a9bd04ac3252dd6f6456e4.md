Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, who do we fight against? We have been at war in 
Iraq and Afghanistan for years. We heard that we are fighting a war on 
terror. But what does that mean? Who are the people at war with 
America?

Now, after all this time, our government has decided we must have a 
politically correct name for our enemy. No longer can we use the term 
''Jihadist,'' the primary meaning being a holy war to subject the world 
to Islam. After all, using that term might hurt our enemies' feelings.

And certainly the most accurate term, ''Islamo-Fascists,'' is 
strictly taboo because it might further anger our enemies by 
insinuating they are a bit radical when they murder in the name of 
religion.

So the government insists that we call the bad guys ''extremists'' or 
''terrorists.''

That vague term won't indicate the war against us is waged in the 
name of radical Muslim religious doctrine. But isn't that the reason 
for this war?

The term ''Jihadist'' is not a reflection on all Muslims. After all, 
many Muslims are literally fighting these radical ideas.

In a war, we must specifically define our enemy. Otherwise, we don't 
know who they are or why we fight.

And that's just the way it is.
