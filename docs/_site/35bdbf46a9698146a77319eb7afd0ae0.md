`Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts â€” 19 September 2007`

Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I will give myself 15 
seconds to say I was waiting for the gentleman to tell me he voted 
against the war in Iraq. He talked about all these things he voted 
against. Added together and doubled, they don't add up to the war in 
Iraq, the continuing indefinite drain. Hundreds of billions of dollars 
have already gone, and they are committed to spending hundreds of 
billions more to make us worse off.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1/1/2/ minutes to the gentleman from North 
Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy).
