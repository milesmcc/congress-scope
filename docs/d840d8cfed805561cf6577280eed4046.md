`Mr. BROUN of Georgia â€” 10 June 2008`

Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Anywhere. We've got oil under South Dakota, 
North Dakota and Montana. Those three States evidently are just 
floating on a sea of oil. There is supposed to be more oil, from what I 
understand, than is in the Middle East.

We can end our dependence on these foreign nations that want to 
destroy us, that want to destroy America. They hate us. And we're 
fueling the insurgency in Iraq. We're fueling these people who hate us. 
They hate our freedom, they hate America, they hate everything that we 
stand for.
