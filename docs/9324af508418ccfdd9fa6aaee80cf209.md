Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I rise in strong support of this rule. I suggest further, if we were 
all adults on this floor, everybody would say this rule, outside of the 
ambit of what amendments are made in order on the defense bill, is an 
appropriate rule. It is an appropriate rule to respond to a mistake 
that was made.

As the gentleman from California observed earlier in debate, mistakes 
are made. Unlike the previous instance some years ago, which were 
discussed on this floor of the deficit reduction bill where the 
minority was not notified, the assertion the minority was not notified 
was absolutely inaccurate,


and Mr. Goodlatte would say that. In point of fact what happened was 
Mr. Peterson learned of it, talked to Mr. Goodlatte about it, then 
discussed it with me, and they decided jointly and bipartisanly to 
proceed.

Unlike the Deficit Reduction Act, the first thing that Mr. Peterson 
said in arguing for the override of the President's veto was, there is 
a problem here. He wanted all the Members to know what the problem was. 
There was not a Member on the floor who didn't know what the problem 
was.

When they voted, a majority of the minority party voted to override 
the President's veto because they believed the policy proposed in that 
bill is a good one. The overwhelming majority of Democrats voted for 
that bill, and 316 out of 435 of us--there weren't 435 of us; there 
were 11 absentees. So 316 out of about 424 voted for this bill.

This bill, unfortunately, included fourteen-fifteenths of the bill we 
passed, and really a larger proportion of that because in terms of 
pages it was probably 95 percent, 98 percent of the bill.

Now, a mistake was made. It was not a venal mistake. It was not a 
conscious mistake. And the mistake was made, as everybody ought to 
know, by the Clerk of the Congress and OMB, and they both made the same 
mistake. And the mistake they made was reading from the printed copy as 
opposed to the parchment copy. OMB didn't read from the parchment copy, 
we didn't read from the parchment copy, because the belief was a 
decision made 10 years ago by the Deputy Clerk not to proofread the 
parchment because changing the parchment was too expensive, but to read 
from the printed copy which then, if found in error, could be corrected 
and reprinted and then programmed for the parchment to be printed from 
that. And both our side--our side, the Congress--and the OMB made the 
same mistake. They assumed, as normally is the case, that the parchment 
reflected exactly what the conference printed report said.

Unfortunately, in this instance it did not. We still don't have a 
full explanation of how that happened. But obviously, notwithstanding 
the fact that parchment indicates that title III in the table of 
contents is included, when you go to page 169, the end of title II, and 
you turn the page to 170, you go to title IV. Now, one would have 
thought it would have been a pretty simple proofreading job if you read 
the parchment. Unfortunately, the print document which was used by OMB 
and the Congress to proof did in fact include title III.

Okay. So we made a mistake. The administration made a mistake, we 
made a mistake, the bill was not whole.

This is, my friends, not an unusual situation. In an 1892 case, which 
was relied upon in the budget case as well, the Court clearly said: 
Whatever the facts are internally to the House of Representatives, what 
the President signs is the statute, is the law.

The Supreme Court says clearly, therefore, that what the President 
sent us back and the veto overridden is in fact what the court has 
found is the law. Now, unfortunately, it doesn't include title III. We 
want to pass title III.

This bill took some 15 months, 18 months of deliberation. The farm 
bill expires tonight or tomorrow, Friday. So we can either do another 
extension, which is possible, or we can pass what was overwhelmingly 
passed in the Senate, overwhelmingly passed in the House of 
Representatives, and, as I said on the floor last night, was passed in 
exactly the same form without title III as was passed in both Houses. 
There were no changes. No alterations. That was not the case in the 
deficit bill that was referred to by Mr. Boehner yesterday.



In fact, a very substantial difference was made in the bill without 
notice to the Democrats, a $2 billion change, I might add, changing 
from 36 months to 13 months the implications of the reimbursement of 
Medicare for implements.

Now, that is all to say that this is not without precedent, number 
one. There are a number of cases that hold that what we did yesterday 
was exactly appropriate, and that law is not subject to question. 
Everything is subject to question, but not valid question or winning 
question.

So what have we done?

First of all, I discussed it with the Parliamentarian. I had not done 
so when we had the colloquy with Mr. Boehner. I then discussed it with 
the chairman. The chairman discussed it throughout the next few hours 
with Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Harkin and others.

I discussed it with Mr. Reid to figure out, a mistake has been made, 
how do we correct that, in fairness to everybody, on a bill, that, by 
the way, the Deficit Reduction Act was passed by a two-vote margin in 
the House, and in the United States Senate was passed because of the 
Vice President's vote. And we were not informed, so we were somewhat 
concerned about the $2 billion mistake that had been made.

In this case, that is not the issue at all, and it's a bill that was, 
in a bipartisan basis, passed by a majority of the Republicans and 
overwhelming majority of Democrats.

So what solution did we come up with? Resending the bill that, under 
the Supreme Court's edict is, in fact, law if it is overridden in the 
Senate, so that fourteen-fifteenths of what is the Congress's intent 
will be accomplished.

The rule then says, but in an abundance of caution, we'll also 
provide for the passage of the entire bill and send it over to the 
Senate, as has been passed overwhelmingly in both Houses.

In addition to that, we said, the bill does not include title III 
that is going to be in the veto message that's sent to the Senate.

I know for the public, this is pretty esoteric, and they don't really 
care. What they care is the substance.

But the point that I'm trying to make is, we are trying to correct a 
mistake and serve the agricultural community, serve those millions of 
people who are relying on the nutritional aid, serving those people who 
are relying on the conservation assistance throughout this country, to 
have this bill, after 18 months almost of consideration, serious 
bipartisan working and overwhelming bipartisan votes in both Houses, 
enacted into law.

But we are also providing separately for the passage of title III. In 
other words, we're doing title III twice, once as the full bill so we 
can repass the full bill. If the Senate decides, as I hope it will, to 
pass that again, then we will not only have passed fourteen-fifteenths, 
we will have passed fifteen-fifteenths in another bill, and they will 
be reconciled and they will be consistent with the law and with the 
will of this body representing the American people.

Now at about 7 p.m. last night, those of you who heard the colloquy, 
I indicated to Mr. Boehner we ought to talk about this. I went by Mr. 
Boehner's office to explain to him what I thought the solution to this 
problem was and discuss it with him. He was not at his office. I left a 
message and my phone number at 7 o'clock last night. I have not yet 
received a response to that visit.

I went to his office to suggest that, pursuant to my representation 
on the floor, we discuss that. I have not yet received a phone call.

I did talk to Mr. Blunt last night. I've talked to Mr. Blunt this 
morning. I frankly am offended, I will tell you, by the 
mischaracterization of what we are doing here by the representatives of 
the minority leader's office.

There are no games being played here. There was a mistake made. And 
if we were adults and nonpartisan and wanted to deal with this in a 
responsible way, I suggest we would have agreed on this proposal.

Now, unfortunately, we didn't get to an agreement. I don't allege 
that anybody on your side has agreed to this. But to suggest that it 
hasn't been discussed, informed, and I called as soon as I came in this 
morning, the leadership on your side, to explain exactly this 
procedure.

Now you can disagree with the farm bill or not disagree with the farm 
bill. I understand that additional games are going to be played, as it 
was my perception last week were played. On Thursday, 131 or 132 of you 
decided, notwithstanding the fact that I am sure you are for funding 
the troops in Iraq, you voted ''present.'' That was your decision.

It's my understanding now that perhaps you're being urged, some of 
you who are for this bill, to deny the two-thirds on the suspension of 
a bill that has gotten essentially three-quarters of


this House and 80 percent of the United States Senate supporting it.

Ladies and gentlemen, at some point in time the American public 
expects us to act as adults, not simply as partisan protagonists, to 
conduct business, notwithstanding the fact because we are humans, and 
those who work for us are humans and are under great stress. They have 
to work around the clock. They work 15-hour days, sometimes longer 
days. And we expect them to act without ever making a mistake. That is 
unreasonable. And when they make mistakes, and when we make mistakes, 
it is appropriate for us respond in a way that will correct those 
mistakes and, at the same time, carry out the policies that are 
overwhelmingly supported by this body.

My friends on both sides of the aisle, I would hope that we could do 
that. I regret that the minority leader has not called me back. I 
regret that he has not sat down and, with me, had the opportunity to 
discuss this. I had a discussion with him before the vote last night. 
It was a very calm, reasonable discussion, Mr. Lawrence and I, outside 
the middle door. We knew there was a problem. We knew we had to solve 
it. I think this does, in fact, solve it from the standpoint of 
adopting the policy overwhelmingly supported by this Congress of 
assuring that title III is addressed, and assuring us of the 
opportunity to make sure that it's not subject even to any lawsuit 
question by, again, passing the entire bill supported by, as I said, 
over 75 percent of the Congress of the United States.

I understand there may be questions about which amendment was allowed 
in order to the defense bill and which wasn't, so on that case, you may 
vote differently on the rule. But on the addressing of the mistake that 
was inadvertently made, and I stress again, by the Congress and by the 
Office of Management and Budget, same mistake apparently was made, that 
we can correct this as adults treating one another in a way that each 
of us would want to be treated to act so that we adopt policies that 
are supported by this Congress.
