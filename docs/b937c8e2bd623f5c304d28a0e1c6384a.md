Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, 6 years after the tragic attacks of 9/11, Osama bin 
Laden remains at large. The minority whip may make light about ordering 
pizza, but the reality is we still haven't gotten Osama bin Laden and 
America faces a continuing threat from al Qaeda and other terrorist 
groups.

Just this week, Admiral Scott Redd, Director of the National 
Counterterrorism Center, said that the Iraq war has created a giant 
recruiting tool for al Qaeda. When asked if we are safer as a result of 
our invasion of Iraq, Admiral Redd said, ''Tactically, probably not.''

Mindful of this threat, our committees have drafted the RESTORE Act. 
I wish to thank Chairman Conyers and members of both committees for 
their great work in drafting this legislation. The RESTORE Act arms our 
intelligence community with powerful new authorities to conduct 
electronic surveillance of terrorist targets around the world, but it 
also restores essential constitutional protections for Americans that 
were sharply eroded when the President signed the Protect America Act, 
or PAA, last August.

Some on the other side want to extend the PAA permanently. That would 
be a huge mistake. According to expert testimony we have received in 
our committee, the PAA authorizes warrantless domestic searches of 
Americans' homes, mail, computers and medical records, as the chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee observed earlier.

Although we don't have any information at this time that the Bush 
administration is using this authority in this way, we must guard 
against the possibility of abuse in the future. Our committee heard 
testimony that the PAA even allows spying without probable cause on our 
own soldiers deployed overseas talking to their families back home. 
That, Mr. Speaker, is wrong.

The RESTORE Act helps restore the balance between security and 
liberty. The RESTORE Act puts the FISA Court back in the business of 
protecting Americans' constitutional rights, after the President and 
Vice President put the court out of business 6 years ago.

Some will try to portray this bill as extending rights to terrorists. 
We have heard that this morning. That is absolutely false. This bill 
does not require individual warrants for terrorists such as Osama bin 
Laden. The bill does not extend fourth amendment rights to foreigners.

What the RESTORE Act does is allow ''block surveillance'' of 
terrorists overseas with speed and agility. And we will never go dark, 
because the bill includes an emergency provision that allows 
surveillance to continue for 45 days, even before the court approves 
the procedures to protect Americans.

This legislation will restore accountability and oversight in all 
three branches. It restores regular audits and reports by the 
Department of Justice, which will be reviewed by the Congress. It also 
requires an audit of the President's Domestic Surveillance Program and 
other warrantless surveillance programs.

Perhaps most importantly, it ensures that when an American is the 
target of surveillance, an individualized warrant is required.

Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle prefer an 
approach that would allow the administration to police itself. This 
simply is unacceptable. If we have learned anything from the past 6 
years, it is that unchecked executive power is a recipe for abuse and 
it has not made us safer.



Mr. Speaker, I have served my country as a soldier in combat in 
Vietnam, as a law enforcement professional on our southern border, and 
as a Member of Congress for the past decade. I have seen the great 
strength of our country; and in my view, the source of that great 
strength is our Constitution. The RESTORE Act provides tools to keep 
this Nation safe and upholds our Constitution and our laws. So I urge 
my colleagues to vote ''yes'' on the RESTORE Act.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
