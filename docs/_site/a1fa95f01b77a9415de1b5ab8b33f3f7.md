Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great 
achievement by Christy DeMaris, a Girl Scout from Huxley, Iowa. Christy 
convinced customers to buy extra boxes of Girl Scout cookies so she 
could send the boxes to our troops in Iraq.

As Christy sold Girl Scout cookies to her customers, she politely 
asked them if they would be willing to purchase extra boxes to be sent 
to troops in Iraq. She amassed 172 boxes to be sent to American troops. 
Christy's mother, Mandi, came up with the idea after hearing of a Boy 
Scout who sent popcorn to soldiers overseas. Christy was very excited 
about the idea because her father, John, works as a civilian computer 
systems administrator in Iraq, keeping the e-mail system working for 
American soldiers. So Christy put the plan into action and made it a 
success.

Christy DeMaris is a shining example of the generosity present in 
today's youth and their promise as tomorrow's leaders. I am proud to 
represent Christy and her parents John and Mandi in the United States 
Congress. I know that my colleagues join me in congratulating Christy 
for her efforts to make brighter days for our American soldiers and I 
wish her and her family the best in their future endeavors.
