Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, this week the House will have 
an opportunity to truly support our troops by having a substantial 
debate here on the House floor about the President's latest proposal 
for a troop escalation in Iraq. Some of my Republican colleagues will 
say that such a debate undermines our troops' efforts in Iraq. Nothing 
could be further from the truth.

How can this Congress stand on the sidelines when the President has 
been told by his generals, by an independent commission created by the 
old Republican Congress, by the American people, and by both Democrats 
and Republicans in the new Congress that this plan will not work? How 
can this Congress stand on the sidelines while our troops continue to 
serve as referees in a situation that even our own intelligence 
agencies say is worse than a civil war?

Madam Speaker, the resolution we will begin to debate today has the 
well-being of our troops first. First and foremost, we support them. We 
support them by saying enough is enough with the bad planning. The 
President should not send more troops to Iraq for the simple reason 
that it will not make any difference on a deteriorating situation on 
the ground.
