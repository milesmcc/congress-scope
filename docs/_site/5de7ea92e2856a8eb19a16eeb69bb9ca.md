Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, I stand here in support of H.R. 5658, the 
Duncan Hunter Defense Authorization Act of FY 2009.

Just a few months ago, we reflected on the 5-year anniversary of this 
war. Today we send a message to our troops that we are with them.

This bill authorizes additional funds for the needs of our troops 
overseas, and more importantly will authorize a pay raise larger than 
that requested by the President.

During these hard economic times of recession, foreclosures, and high 
gas prices, our military families need all our help and support. This 
bill prohibits fee increases in TRICARE and expands available health 
care services.

This bill is a step in the right direction, with directives for the 
Afghanistan conflict, and more accountability of the Iraqi government 
and contractors.

Today we make our commitment to the Americans we represent, and their 
sons, daughters, husbands, wives, sisters and brothers serving as part 
of the Armed Forces. They are fighting a war that is not their fight.

In my district alone, 13 families will sit at their dinner table 
without a loved one. To these families in my district and those 
throughout the Nation, I thank you for your service, your sacrifice and 
your love for this Nation. You are the back bone of the Armed Forces.

I urge my colleagues to keep our commitment to our troops, redirect 
this war in the right direction and vote for H.R. 5658.
