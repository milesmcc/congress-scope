Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow, my friend from 
Michigan, for the comments about children's health. She is right-on 
about that. Look at the choice. We are going to spend $2.5 billion a 
week in Iraq. Yet we are unwilling per year to spend $7 billion to 
insure 4 million additional children--some 75,000 in my State and 
50,000 or 60,000 in the State of Michigan next door. We are spending 
$2.5 billion a week in Iraq. Yet the President says he is going to say 
no and veto this bill on children's health.
