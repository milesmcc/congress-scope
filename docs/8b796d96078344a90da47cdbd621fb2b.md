Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, as I closed the rally today with 400 
veterans in support of our troops and their mission in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, I quoted John Stuart Mill, who said, ''War is an ugly 
thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of 
moral unpatriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is 
much worse. A person who has nothing for which they are willing to 
fight, nothing they care more about than their own personal safety, is 
a miserable creature who has no chance of ever being free unless those 
very freedoms are made and kept by better persons than themselves.''

Those better persons are our Nation's veterans, the men and women in 
uniform, and today may God almighty, Jehovah God, bless and keep those 
brave Americans in harm's way on our behalf.
