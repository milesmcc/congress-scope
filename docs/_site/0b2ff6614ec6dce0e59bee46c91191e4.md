Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.

Mr. Speaker, it is not the majority party that is in a hole. It is 
the U.S. policy toward Iraq that is in a hole. It is not the majority 
party that is in disarray. Last time I looked, the headlines said that 
there was a bunch of Republicans going down to the White House 
yesterday to tell the President that the jig is almost up on his Iraqi 
policy.



The gentleman says we should fully fund the troops. We have provided 
$4 billion more for the troops than the President asked for. We are 
fully funding the troops. What we are not fully funding is a bankrupt 
policy in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2/1/2/ minutes to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Israel).
