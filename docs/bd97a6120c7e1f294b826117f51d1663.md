Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I 
hope the author will tell that mother in rural America that his money 
cuts grants to rural areas, to her local schools in rural areas, to her 
hospitals and to her rural businesses who all want to get access to 
broadband. They're leaving the rural area because they don't have this.

Also tell that mother that the same amount of money is being spent in 
Iraq in 45 minutes, in 45 minutes. In just the time of this debate, 
we're spending more money than this amendment cuts in Iraq to build 
those things that he wants to cut away from rural America.

This amendment is wrong. I oppose it.
