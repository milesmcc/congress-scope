Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to commend 
Congressman Israel for introducing this much needed resolution and also 
as a veteran myself and as a physician, we need to be looking for 
public-private partnerships. I couldn't be happier with this because 
the VA is not meeting the entire need that we have of our veterans 
right now in treating PTSD. We need to look at innovative ways to put 
these young men and women back into the workforce and to help them. And 
certainly not just with the Iraq and Afghanistan war but through the 
Vietnam War and World War II. Many of our troops out there are dealing 
with this very, very serious problem. I want to thank these 
organizations privately for stepping up.
