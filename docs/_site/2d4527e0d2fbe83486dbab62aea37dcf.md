Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my 
deepest concern for the situation that is worsening in Iraq.

March 19 of this year will mark the fifth year of war, and still Vice 
President Cheney states that the Democratic strategy toward Iraq 
validates al Qaeda's agenda. This comment really means that anyone that 
disagrees with him gets accused of this issue.

Terrorists instill fear in their enemies, and it is this fear that 
generates self-defeating behavior. It is this fear that led the 
American people to believe that war was a validated solution, and still 
try to link it to September 11. It is this fear that has cost the 
United States billions of dollars on Iraq reconstruction plans, while 
neglecting our own system.
