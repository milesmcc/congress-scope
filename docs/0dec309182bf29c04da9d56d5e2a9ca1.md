`Mr. TOWNS â€” 1 December 2009`

---


Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mark E. 
Evans who was born in Brent, England on September 5, 1968. At the age 
of twelve, he and his siblings migrated to the United States to live 
with his parents in Queens Village, New York. He attended PS 109 Junior 
High School and Newtown High School.

Following his High School graduation in 1987, Mr. Evans enlisted in 
the United States Army. He completed Basic Training at Fort 
Leonardwood, Missouri, as well as his advance military occupational 
skill training as an Interior Electrician. While on active duty, he was 
stationed in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, South Korea and Fort McClellan, 
Alabama. He also served six months in the Middle East during Operations 
Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

In August 1991, after spending four years on active duty, Mark 
returned home to Queens Village and attended York College in Queens 
while maintaining his attachment to the Military as a member of the 
Army Reserve. He met his wife Sonia through a mutual friend in December 
1992 and on August 17, 1997 they were married.

Mark worked full time, attended college and was a Weekend Warrior 
with the Army Reserve. His hard work and dedication paid off upon 
receipt of a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology in 1998. In 1999, Mark 
started the process of becoming a New York City Police Officer. By 
October 2000, he graduated from the New York City Police Academy, and 
he was assigned to the 30th Precinct in Harlem. Following 9/11, he was 
transferred to Manhattan Traffic Task Force, where he would better 
service the department by effectively managing ground zero. To this 
day, he continues to patrol the streets of Manhattan.

In his continuation of military service, he served with the 344th 
Combat Support Hospital in Flushing, New York and 445th Quartermaster 
Company in Trenton, New Jersey. He was deployed to Iraq where he served 
one year in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He is currently serving 
with the 411th Civil Affairs Battalion in Danbury, Connecticut as the 
First Sergeant for Headquarters Company. He is expected to deploy to 
Afghanistan in 2010.

With twenty-two years of military service and ten years as a New York 
City Police Officer, he is committed to improving our society by 
serving our nation both domestically and abroad. His dedication to 
duty, as a father of two (Gordan and Nyah), husband, Soldier and Police 
Officer is unwavering.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. 
Mark E. Evans.
