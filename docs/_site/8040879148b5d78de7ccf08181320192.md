`Mr. CARDIN â€” 17 September 2008`

Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the fiscal 
year 2009 Defense Authorization Act, a critical piece of legislation 
that honors the men and women who are so honorably serving in the Armed 
Forces and that provides our military with the tools it needs to keep 
our country safe.

I am most proud of the investments this legislation makes in our 
military's most important resource--the men and women who serve in 
uniform. Recognizing the strain multiple deployments and difficult 
economic times has placed on our troops and their families, this bill 
increases military pay by 3.9 percent.

This bill goes further to make sure that we keep our military strong 
at a time when two wars have overstretched and overstressed our troops. 
The bill allows us to grow our military. By increasing the end strength 
of the Army, Marine Corps, Air National Guard, and Army Reserve, we can 
reduce the stress on our troops caused by multiple and extended 
deployments. And we can be sure we have the troops we need to meet 
future challenges in an ever more uncertain world.



This bill continues bonuses and incentives that reward our military 
men and women and encourage them to continue their service. It provides 
new incentives to military psychologists and nursing students to 
address the ongoing shortages in these critical areas. The legislation 
prohibits the Administration's proposed increase in TRICARE fees for 
retirees and reservists.

While medical treatment for wounded soldiers has improved 
dramatically over the course of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, too 
often that care is just too hard to access. I believe that managing 
paperwork and scheduling appointments in a timely and efficient manner 
is just as much a part of quality medical care as the treatment 
provided by medics and surgeons.

Last year this Congress acted aggressively to address the red tape 
that kept our wounded warriors from their doctors and counselors. The 
Wounded Warrior Act allowed the Department of Defense to address the 
substandard living conditions, poor outpatient care and bureaucratic 
roadblocks faced by injured soldiers at Walter Reed and around the 
country.

One month ago, I visited a soldier transition unit at Ft. Meade, MD. 
I saw firsthand how hard our wounded warriors are working to recover 
from their often devastating injuries. I saw a Department of Defense 
that has recommitted itself to making sure our wounded warriors and 
their families get the care and support they need and deserve. This 
bill requires that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs 
continue the Senior Oversight Committee that oversees implementation of 
wounded warrior initiatives. This high level leadership is critical if 
we are going to continue to improve the quality of care we provide our 
troops.

Investments in growing the force as well as in providing fair pay and 
good benefits are smart investments in our military's most valuable 
resource. Our military is only as strong as the skilled and dedicated 
men and women who serve.

Even with all the important provisions in this bill, I think it can 
be even better. It's been 60 years since President Harry S. Truman 
ended racial segregation in the military. In the intervening years, 
military leaders have come to believe that maintaining a highly 
qualified, diverse military--from the enlisted ranks to the four-star 
generals and admirals--is essential to the military's ability to 
provide for our national security. A military that clearly reflects 
equal opportunity for everyone is critical, not only for morale, but 
also for readiness. Just look at the increasingly diverse enemies we 
confront and the divergent environments into which we send our troops.

But despite future projections of minority growth in the United 
States, a recent senior-level Department of Defense projection found 
virtually no prospect for reaching adequate representation of 
minorities or women in the higher military ranks in the next decade. I 
am proud that increasing the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of our 
military leadership has become a strategic priority for the Department 
of Defense. The Department commissioned the Rand Corporation to make 
recommendations for how it could improve.

Issued in 2008, the Rand Corporation's report, titled Planning for 
Diversity, found that the Department of Defense remains ill prepared to 
retain and promote minorities and women to leadership positions. 
Specifically, the Department is still without a uniform definition of 
diversity as well as a department-wide plan to guide, support, and 
streamline diversity efforts. On the heels of the 60th anniversary of 
integration of the Armed Forces, we can and must do better.

I filed an amendment to the fiscal year 2009 Defense Authorization 
Act that would jump start the creation of a strategic plan for 
achieving this departmental priority: ensuring diversity at all levels 
of the military. My amendment would create a high-level task force to 
study the current state of diversity at all levels of the Armed Forces 
and make recommendations for improvement. The task force would consist 
of senior members of the Armed Forces as well as individuals with 
expertise in cultivating and managing diversity in private or non-
profit organizations. The task force would develop the first 
department-wide definition of diversity, evaluate existing policies for 
encouraging diversity in and outside the military, and make 
recommendations for future action for increasing diversity at all 
levels and in all areas of the military departments.

The amendment builds on a provision included in the House Defense 
Authorization bill and incorporates comments by the Department of 
Defense. The Department stated in formal comments that it ''welcome[s] 
the assistance that would come from the work proposed by the 
legislation.''

I am grateful to my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, 
especially Congressman Elijah E. Cummings, Congresswoman Diane E. 
Watson, Congressman Hank Johnson, and Congressman Kendrick B. Meek who 
have worked so hard on this issue and on this provision. I am very 
disappointed today that the amendment could neither receive a vote nor 
be included in the bill by unanimous agreement. I hope that as the 
managers of this bill work to finalize the fiscal year 2009 Defense 
Authorization Act, they will consider the language I have proposed to 
increase diversity at all levels of the Armed Forces.

Mr. President, in closing, I commend my colleagues Chairman Levin, 
Senator Warner, and all the other members of the Armed Services 
Committee for their hard work to craft and pass this bill. I look 
forward to casting my vote to support it. I also want to take a moment 
to congratulate Senator Warner for his work on countless other critical 
pieces of legislation in years past. I will miss his wise counsel on 
issues of national and regional importance, I will miss his good humor, 
and I will miss his grace. I wish him only the best in retirement.
