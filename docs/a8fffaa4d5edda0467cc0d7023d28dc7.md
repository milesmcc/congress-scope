## `a8fffaa4d5edda0467cc0d7023d28dc7`
`Mr. REID â€” 5 September 2007`

Mr. REID. I spoke briefly yesterday morning. A 19-year-old--as the 
Senator knows, my dad killed himself, so I understand something about 
suicide--a 19-year-old soldier from Las Vegas came back to Las Vegas. 
He told his parents and everybody else he didn't want to go back to 
Iraq. I think they said they gave him medicine--Prozac, whatever it 
was--and sent him back. In a matter of a few days, he killed himself.

Suicide is a devastating problem. It is a problem in the civilian 
population. Mr. President, 31,000 people kill themselves every year. We 
don't understand the issue at all. We haven't studied it enough. What 
is going on in the civilian side is a mere shadow of what is going on 
in the military.
