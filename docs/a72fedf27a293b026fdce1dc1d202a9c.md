Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County for launching a new innovative 
Armed Services Advocacy Project. This new service will provide civil 
legal assistance to Armed Forces members who have served in Iraq or 
Afghanistan and their families. With over 1,200 veterans of these 
ongoing conflicts residing in our community, the need for these 
services is tremendous.

The legal services provided by Legal Aid will be free of charge to 
Active Duty servicemembers, veterans and their families, and will cover 
a range of issues, most importantly, helping to improve access to 
veterans benefits.

I believe that every person who puts on the uniform of this country 
must have access to the full range of benefits they have earned. And 
this new Legal Aid project brings us one step closer to meeting this 
commitment in south Florida.

I would like to thank Robert Bertisch, Executive Director of the 
Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County, and Elaine Martens of the Armed


Forces Advocacy Project, as well as all members of the society for 
their dedication to serving those who have served our country.
