# WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007
## `c20796edbcdac95b294a8994f1196a9f`
`Mr. COCHRAN â€” 16 May 2007`

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of the 
Senate that the President should receive from the Congress acceptable 
legislation to continue funding the operations--Iraqi Freedom and 
Enduring Freedom--by not later than May 28 of this year. The funds 
previously appropriated by the Congress for operations in this region 
are depleted, according to a letter and testimony before our committee 
from the Secretary of Defense and other military leaders and the 
service chiefs who have appeared before our committee as well.

The President requested supplemental funding over 3 months ago, and 
no supplemental funding has been approved by the Congress. We are 
putting troops at risk. We are keeping the military from deploying 
equipment and armaments that will protect the lives and save lives of 
American troops in this region. I think it is the responsible thing to 
do, Mr. President, for us to approve this supplemental funding.
