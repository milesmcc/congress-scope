Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to 
rescind funds appropriated for the procurement of the V-22 and CV-22 
Osprey. This aircraft has been the subject of significant controversy 
because of safety, technical, and cost problems. In 1991, then-
Secretary Dick Cheney tried to cancel the program altogether. I have 
long advocated for more extensive testing of the aircraft to evaluate 
design defects that render the Osprey unstable and technical problems 
that have already cost the lives of 30 servicemembers. New problems 
were discovered as recently as June 2007.

I appreciate that the military is in need of additional helicopters, 
particularly as a result of the high operational tempo in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Given the fact that the Osprey costs significantly more 
than other aircraft that can meet the same need, I believe we should 
shift to a safer, more economic program.

This bill would rescind funds appropriated for the program through 
2008. That includes $2.8 billion in previously appropriated but 
unobligated funds and $2.9 billion in funds appropriated for fiscal 
year 08. The Defense Department estimates it will spend an additional 
$28.6 billion to purchase a total of 458 Osprey through 2018. Ending 
this troubled program could produce savings of over $34.3 billion.
