Mr. BOUSTANY. That is absolutely true and important. Not only that, 
Prime Minister al-Maliki made the decision to employ those troops in 
Basra, to take it into his own hands, and that was a huge move, because 
before he was afraid to confront the Jaish al-Mahdi and those 
insurgents. Not only that, Muqtada al-Sadr was partly responsible for 
helping position Maliki in as prime minister, and before he refused to 
take action against them when they are were doing unlawful activities.

For him to take that step was large. It was huge. And even though 
operationally it didn't go as smoothly as we hoped, it was a big step 
for them to go forward to do this, and that is a sign that things have 
changed. And we are seeing a change at the central level as well as 
what has been accomplished at the local level. As those two efforts 
merge, we will see a stable Iraq.
