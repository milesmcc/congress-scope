# TIME TO PASS A CLEAN TROOP FUNDING BILL

Mr. CARTER. Madam Speaker, the Democratic leaders have ignored the 
President's promise to veto legislation which loads our soldiers down 
with their pork-barrel spending and sets arbitrary deadlines for 
pulling out of Iraq. They know it is going to be vetoed, but they 
continue to make our troops wait.

The Commander in Chief, by their provision, would have to wait 15 
days to deploy troops in certain circumstances, preventing us from 
having reinforcements for our soldiers in harm's way. They want to tie 
the hands of our generals by setting a surrender date. The first 
surrender date, they said, is July 1 of this year.

We don't need 535 generals in Washington commanding our troops. We 
need the professionals.

It is past time for the Democrats to do the right thing and pass a 
bill which funds our troops in harm's way. Their final drop-dead date 
deadline that they have set is very interesting, April 1, 2008. April 
Fool's day. Who are they trying to fool?
