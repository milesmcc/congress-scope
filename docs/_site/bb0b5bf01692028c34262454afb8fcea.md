`Mr. MEEKS of New York â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. MEEKS of New York. Mr. Speaker, as the November election clearly 
showed, Iraq is the number one issue weighing on Americans' minds. A 
vast majority of people across the Nation strongly disagree with the 
President's plan to send nearly 21,500 additional troops into Iraq, and 
a bipartisan majority in this Congress has also voiced its opposition 
to this measure.

This week here in the people's House, we will have an opportunity to 
express our opinions on the troop escalation, and then we will have to 
vote whether or not we support the President's plan. The American 
people want a debate. And while there is one going on in this House, 
the Senate Republican leadership continues to block debate in the 
Senate.

One has to wonder what Senate Republican leaders are so worried 
about. After all, Republican Senators, like John Warner and Chuck 
Hagel, joined with Democrats to propose their own resolution opposing 
the troop escalation.

Are Senate Republican leaders really willing to stifle the voices of 
their own Republican colleagues so that they can continue to protect 
the Bush administration? It is time for real debate. It is time for a 
new direction on this war.
