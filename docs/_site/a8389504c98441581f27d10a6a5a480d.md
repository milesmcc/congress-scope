Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, President Bush has threatened to veto a 
bill that would provide health care insurance to 5 million children who 
are currently uninsured. The President's reason: The bill is simply too 
expensive. But what he ignores is the fact that the CHAMP Act is fully 
paid for.

This Democratic House is concerned that too many children are growing 
up without health insurance, making it impossible for them to receive 
the regular checkups that they need to live long and healthy lives. The 
CHAMP Act would strengthen the CHIP program, a popular Federal-State 
health care partnership so we can reach nearly all of the children who 
are currently eligible for the program.

The price tag is an additional $50 billion over 5 years. Again, the 
President says it is simply too much money. Yet, he has no problem 
asking this Congress to rubber-stamp a new Iraq war emergency funding 
bill that press reports say could be as high as $50 billion and that 
would only last about 5 months.

Madam Speaker, it is time President Bush prioritize the health care 
needs of our Nation's children. He should simply support the CHAMP Act.
