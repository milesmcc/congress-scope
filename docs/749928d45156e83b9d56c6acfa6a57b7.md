# UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT
## `749928d45156e83b9d56c6acfa6a57b7`
`Ms. LANDRIEU â€” 24 May 2007`

---


Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I begin by thanking majority leader 
Harry Reid for his extraordinary work in helping to negotiate the full 
Katrina-Rita package that many of us worked on to try to accelerate and 
jump-start the recovery that is underway slowly, solidly in some 
places, and not so solidly in others along the entire gulf coast of 
this Nation, America's energy coast. Louisiana sits in the middle of 
this great coastline and was hit not by one but by two monstrous storms 
18 months ago. But, as my colleagues have heard me say many times, it 
wasn't just Katrina and Rita that did so much damage, it was the 
collapse of a Federal levee system that should have held but didn't 
hold. In Louisiana alone, 200,000 homes were totally destroyed. In 
Mississippi, it was over 65,000 homes because of the surge that came 
out of the gulf.


It is hard for people to comprehend what that means. It is still 
difficult for those of us who live there to get a handle on the scope 
of the damage and devastation. We are grateful for the generosity of 
this Nation. We are grateful for the private contributions, the many 
church groups and people of faith who have come to help us, and we are 
excited about this package in this emergency supplemental.

When we began this journey 4 or 5 months ago, there were some on the 
opposition side that said we didn't need to include any of this; that 
this is for an emergency overseas. But I really want to remind everyone 
that we are still in a state of emergency on the gulf coast, and asking 
for $3.7 billion in a $120 billion bill is really not too much to ask 
for hard-working American taxpayers whose homes had never flooded 
before. Many of these home owners and business owners never had an inch 
of water in them, but they suddenly came home or woke up to 12 to 14 
feet of water, up to their roofs, ruining everything they had worked 
for, sometimes everything their parents and grandparents had worked 
for.

Briefly, what we have done, in this last minute as I summarize, is to 
waive the 10-percent match, which is critical. It is not only the money 
that is helpful, obviously, to not have to put up that 10 percent, but 
mostly by waiving the match we are waiving 90 percent of the redtape 
that is keeping these hard-working people who are doing everything they 
can to rebuild their lives.

There were some in the administration who wanted to play games with 
the levees, and move levees from the east bank to the west bank and say 
we will fund it later. Well, there is no later for us. There is now, 
and we are going to build these levees and protect the people in south 
Louisiana. That has been done.

One other part that is very important to me, and a provision I 
objected to when it was first implemented 2 years ago, is the option 
for the forgiveness of loans, which had been taken away. I said, on 
behalf of the people I represent, we are entitled to the same response 
that other communities have received, and this bill gives us justice on 
the gulf coast.

In addition, there is some money for help for our criminal justice 
system that needs improvement, and to correct some of the teacher 
shortages as a result of the collapse and damage to many schools, and 
teachers who have had to move to higher ground but who want to come 
back to teach the children.

Finally, let me thank Senator Murray, who has been extraordinary in 
her efforts on our behalf. I also thank Senator Byrd, the chairman of 
our committee. They were not going to let this bill get through without 
Katrina and Rita being recognized and the hundreds of thousands of 
people who are depending on this Congress to keep fighting for them and 
to at least meet them halfway. We do not look for charity, we look for 
a hand up. We look for our Government to meet us halfway.

We can afford at least 10 to 15 days' worth of Iraq spending toward 
rebuilding the great energy coast of America.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
