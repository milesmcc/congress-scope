## `5ed9a5598be3e24f79dd090973bef651`
`Mr. SMITH of Nebraska â€” 15 June 2007`

---


Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, on a day when the House of 
Representatives has passed legislation providing for the health and 
well-being of our veterans, it is with a heavy heart I honor a brave 
man who will not be returning home. Specialist Josiah Hollopeter, of 
Valentine, NE, was shot and killed by small arms fire while on 
dismounted patrol in Normandy, Iraq, on June 14.

My thoughts and prayers are with Josiah's family--his parents and his 
wife--today. Josiah represented the best of what it means to be a 
Nebraskan. His service and sacrifice for our country will long be 
remembered.

Again, I ask my colleagues to remember the Hollopeter family during 
this time of grieving.


And to remember Josiah's comrades in arms who are still in harm's way.
