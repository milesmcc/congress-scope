Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairman, actually I thank the gentleman from New 
York for bringing this amendment forward. It would provide cost free 
vouchers to allow mailing of packages to members serving in Iraq and 
also in Afghanistan, and the committee has no objection and appreciates 
the thoughtfulness on this issue.

Madam Chairman, I yield back.
