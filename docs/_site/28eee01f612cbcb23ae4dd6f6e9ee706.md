Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise 
today to honor Liam Swan, a constituent of mine who is currently a 
student at Oliver Pierce Middle School in Ramona, CA. One of our local 
hometown papers in San Diego County, the Ramona Home Journal, recently 
printed a poem written by Liam that memorializes and pays tribute to 
the servicemen and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice fighting 
to preserve freedom in Iraq. His poem, titled ''Ode to the Fallen 
Soldiers of Iraq,'' follows:



 To all you brave soldiers who have fallen in Iraq,


 Who left the comforting embrace of


 Family, friends, and home


 To fight and protect the freedom of others


 In a faraway dry, dusty and desolate land,


 We Americans honor and salute you.



 Like dry leaves we must crumble and toss


 Our differences aside.


 Where you are


 Hawk or Dove,


 Democrat or Republican,


 Liberal or Conservative,


 We must first be Americans


 Who honor the fallen heroes that fought for us.



 For you bravely laid down your lives,


 Spilling your blood and dreams


 In a foreign land,


 For a foreign people


 For an American Cause,


 Know that you will be greatly missed,


 Know that you will always be remembered


 For your sacrifice,


 For your courage and convictions.


 Your bright and promising light


 Extinguished too soon,


 We celebrate and honor your memory


 You fallen soldiers of Iraq.


As ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, I share 
Liam's strong support, appreciation and respect for our servicemen and 
women. I am particularly pleased each time I learn about Americans, 
like Liam, who are willing to use their creative talents to ensure the 
memory of those who have voluntarily left the comfort of their homes to 
defend and protect the interests of the American people, are never 
forgotten.

Madam Speaker, Liam's words reflect our Nation's overwhelming 
gratitude to the millions of uniformed military men and women that have 
answered the call to duty with unquestioned courage and commitment. I 
wish Liam continued success in his academic efforts and it is with 
absolute pride that I rise today to share his inspiring and patriotic 
tribute with my colleagues.
