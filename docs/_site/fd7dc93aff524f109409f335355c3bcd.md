Mr. SHAYS. If the gentleman will yield, when I was there this last 
time, what I found for the first time was that when the Iraqis got 
together to form a government last year, they were like someone 
described a sixth grade dance. The guys were there, the girls were 
there. Maybe once or twice there would be a little interaction, and 
they would go back. But nobody was dancing.

Now you are starting to see Sunnis, Shias and Kurds trying to see 
some common ground, and they are coming back to us and saying, don't 
rush us. But one of them said to me, I thought it was interesting, he 
said, ''You are complaining about the fact that we may take a break in 
the summer. What about your monthly break?'' They said, ''You are 
asking Sunnis, Shias and Kurds to work together. How come you guys 
aren't working together?'' They are starting to come back and throw 
that at us.

The difference is they are in an environment where they can get 
killed any day of the week, and yet we are telling them, find common 
ground. If they found common ground, probably some of that killing 
would talk.

But I am sorry to take so much of the time. I am just trying to add 
to your point that they are saying why don't we practice what we 
preach?
