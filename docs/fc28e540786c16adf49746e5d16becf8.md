Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 387 provides for consideration of 
three bills, including the supplemental appropriations for the Iraq 
war.

It is striking to realize that for 4 years the war in Iraq has been 
funded by supplemental appropriations measures. From the beginning the 
White House has refused to plan ahead. Instead it has counted on 
Congress to accept its demands and pass one supplemental bill and then 
another time and time again, with no end in sight and no accountability 
required in return.

The American people have rejected a House that blindly accepts the 
administration's predictions about Iraq, all the while ceding its role 
in deciding matters of war and peace, the most solemn responsibility 
given to the Congress.

My fellow Democrats and I promised a new way forward. And so the 
first funding bill that we delivered to the President reconciled our 
party's conscience with the brutal realities the war presented to us, 
realities that we, unlike some in the administration, are willing to 
acknowledge.

We sought then, as we do now, to end this war but to do so 
responsibly, without adding to the suffering the Iraqi people and our 
soldiers have already experienced.

Our first bill provided the President with all of the funding he 
requested but attached conditions to it. We asked for the President to 
stand before the Nation and justify the war. We asked him to show how 
it was meeting the objectives that he himself had set out: the


promotion of political progress in the country and the increase of 
internal security in Iraq, all of which is his responsibility. And we 
said the war would not go on forever, that it must have an end, not an 
irresponsible end but an end.

The President rejected our offer out of hand. He told us that while 
he would never compromise, we had to.

Mr. Speaker, stubbornness is not the same as strength. Being 
obstinate is not equivalent to having conviction. This President 
famously told the world that he would refuse to alter his policy in 
Iraq even if, as he put it, nobody stood by him except his wife and his 
dog.

But he is not making decisions that impact only himself. The weight 
of his decisions are being borne by the American people and the people 
of Iraq. His decisions are costing American lives and they are costing 
Iraqi lives. They are overstretching our military. They are undermining 
the national security of this Nation. And they are not improving the 
wretched conditions of the Iraqis the war is theoretically helping.

The President must not be allowed to ignore everyone: the majority of 
the generals, the majority of the House, the majority of the Senate, 
the majority of the Nation, and the overwhelming majority of the world. 
He must not be allowed to ignore everyone when it is they who are 
bearing the burden of his war and suffering the consequences of his 
administration's mistakes. He must understand that his opinion, as 
sincere as it may be, is not the only one that matters. He must yield.

The bill we are considering today will, once again, give him the 
chance to acknowledge the demands of the citizens of this country. They 
are demanding a change of direction in Iraq, and this bill delivers it.

This legislation will fund military operations in Iraq between now 
and July. By then the President's surge plan will be in full effect, 
and its impact, either positive or negative, will be obvious. The 
President will report to Congress on the state of political and 
military progress in Iraq, and then we will vote on whether or not to 
provide the remaining funds that have been requested. Our degree of 
financial support at that point will be based not on endless promises 
or rosy scenarios, but on concrete reality on the ground in Iraq. 
Accountability is being introduced into the conduct of this war.

Mr. Speaker, let me also add that during the last debate on this 
supplemental, the President and his supporters told us the measure was 
''unclean,'' that it contained spending unrelated to the war effort.

That spending, Mr. Speaker, was for critical projects the last 
Congress failed to fund by not passing any budget at all for the year 
2007, which included funding for veterans care, recovery from Hurricane 
Katrina, health insurance for children, home heating oil for low-income 
families, and much more. In other words, there is nothing dirty about 
it. My fellow Democrats and I refuse to abandon it. We are going to 
fund these vital and important projects because people are counting on 
them. What is more, we campaigned on increasing the minimum wage, and 
this supplemental spending legislation will do that as well. And I hope 
we don't hear anything more about so-called ''unrelated spending.''

Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for this body to abandon the 
destructive rhetoric that has labeled this plan a form of 
''surrender.'' It is time to stop branding the Democrats, and a growing 
number of Republicans, who seek to end this brutal conflict as 
''defeatists.''

We want our country to be secure. We want our military to be sound. 
We want the Iraqi people to be able to live with dignity. But we see 
that this war fought in this way is undermining all of those goals. And 
we are not alone. We speak for a clear and vocal majority of the 
American people, and we represent their wishes. For the sake of our 
citizens, for our soldiers, and the people of Iraq, we will be heard.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
