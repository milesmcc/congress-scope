Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Wow. Before I yield to the gentlelady, I just 
want to say that old adage, ''pennywise and pound foolish.'' I started 
this hour out by talking about all of the competing problems that we 
discuss on this floor, the cost of the war and cost of health care, 
costs of Medicare and Social Security, those entitlement programs, the 
cost of escalating the war in Afghanistan, the great recession where, 
at its height, 700,000 jobs were lost in a single month, the bailout 
funds for the ''too big to fail'' institutions.

And so if we allow ourselves to get mired down in this and decide 
that $200 million for an education program is just too much money, that 
would be the perfect place to talk about pennywise and pound foolish, 
wouldn't you agree, gentleman?
