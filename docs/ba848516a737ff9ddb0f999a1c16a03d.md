`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 9 April 2008`

---


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. As we've gone through this debate for years and 
years and years, as you said, we've been on the floor talking about 
this for a long time; and you start to hear these arguments, the same 
ones over and over and over regardless of what the facts are on the 
ground.

And the issue, I think, that has become most apparent, and some say 
the surge was a success. Some say, well, maybe it wasn't. Some say 
there hasn't been any political success. Some say there has been some. 
I think this has kind of gotten boiled down to one point. Some people 
are saying we need to stay. And you know what? Maybe, maybe if we 
accept that argument, maybe they're right. Maybe we should stay. But 
they're only going to stay at the expense of the future of this 
country. We will bankrupt this country if we continue to stay in Iraq.

And when you look at all of the great powers over time, they get too 
extended, too far out, too far out ahead of themselves; and what we are 
saying here is there is a reality on the ground that we need to deal 
with in order to address the issues that are facing the United States 
of America. This is about making sure that we are a strong country. If 
we are not a strong country, we are of no good to anybody else.

And the point that we are trying to make and that the Speaker is 
trying to make and the Democrats in the Senate are trying to make and 
like-minded Republicans are trying to make is that we can't sacrifice 
the United States of America for Iraq.

Now, we do bear some responsibility because we went in, but you can't 
continue to say that we are going to borrow, because we don't have this 
money. We are borrowing it all. $3 trillion is what the projections are 
now for the cost for Iraq when you factor in vets coming back and 
health care and what not. $3 trillion? We are going to borrow it from 
China and Japan and OPEC countries to fund a war that we are not having 
any political progress at all?

The sides are not reconciling. They're not moving forward in the 
political process. That's a problem.

So, even if you say we need to stay, you need to then be willing to 
spend enormous amounts of money, United States dollars, over the course 
of the next several decades and, as some people have said, over the 
course of the next hundred years.

And what we are trying to say is, we've got problems here at home 
that we need to deal with. We've got an energy crisis. We've got a 
health care issue that needs to be dealt with. Growing inequality. We 
can't afford to spend $3 trillion on this war.

Now, I don't think that's unreasonable because the strength of the 
country is at stake, and all we have to do is look around. We don't 
have this money. And this isn't just us. Joseph Stiglitz, Noble Peace 
Prize economist, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and there's no 
such thing as a free war. The Iraq adventure has severely weakened the 
U.S. economy whose woes go far beyond loose mortgage lending. You can't 
spend $3 trillion, yes, $3 trillion, on a failed war abroad and not 
feel the pain at home.

This is a political reality that we have to deal with in the United 
States of America. And we are making difficult decisions. No one is 
saying yank the rug out. We are saying have a responsible, planned exit 
in which this country and the soldiers that we have trained and the 
close to $1 trillion that we have spent already, that investment, allow 
these people to take over their country.

I think there's a little bit of a misperception that there is not 
going to be, like we are going to be able to just leave Iraq, whenever 
it is, tomorrow or 10 years from now; and if we do it right, that there 
is not going to be any conflict, we will just kind of sneak out and 
everything will just harmoniously arrange itself.

And I think we need to realize that whether we get out 6 months from 
now or a year from now or 8, 10 years from now, there's going to be 
conflict. You have got groups of people that have hated each other for 
thousands of years. And there is not going to be any real polite 
settlement of this dispute.



And so we need to realize that. And by realizing that, I think it 
helps us get to the point where we say, well, maybe we need to just get 
out now because this dust-up is going to happen anyway.

And when you look at what happened the other day with the Iraqi 
offensive onto this militia group and then a thousand Iraqi soldiers 
left and abandoned the mission, would they have left if we weren't 
there? That's a question I think we need to ask, would they have left? 
But they know we're there. This is part of the problem.

We're creating a welfare state. These people are in a state of 
dependency upon the United States, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And if we 
continue to be there all the time, we're never going to leave, we're 
always going to be here for you. You know, you see all the time, this 
is the equivalent of a 35-year-old person still living at home with 
their parents. They get into a state of dependency, and they can never 
be responsible.

And I understand all the dynamics. I didn't want to go into this war 
in the first place, I was against it from the beginning, so we've got 
some responsibility to bear. But haven't we made the investment? And we 
know at some point they've got to step up and make their own way here. 
So I think a lot of us are just saying, let's just do it.

I yield to my friend.
