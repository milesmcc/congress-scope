`Mr. DURBIN â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning after morning business, we 
will resume consideration of the Defense authorization bill. This is an 
annual bill that comes before us relating to the Department of Defense 
and the conduct of America's national defense. It is an important bill 
made more important this year because the focus of debate at this 
moment is on the war in Iraq.

We understand this is an issue that is on the minds of most 
Americans. We also understand that this is a body, the Senate, where we 
represent the people of this country. I believe the debate should be an 
open debate, one that gives opportunity for both points of view to be 
expressed. I also believe that at the end of the debate on the central 
issue of the war in Iraq, we should take a majority vote and decide 
what the Senate stands for when it comes to our policy.

Those who stand for the President's position can oppose the Levin-
Reed amendment, which is pending and is going to be considered soon. It 
is an amendment which establishes a timetable for American troops to 
start coming home. It is a timetable for ending this war responsibly, 
ending our combat role by the spring of next year. It is the only 
amendment pending which is specific and will change the policy and 
direction in Iraq.

Unfortunately, the procedural issues ahead of us are very 
complicated. The Senate Republican leader, Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, 
has insisted that instead of a majority vote on the war in Iraq, it 
will be necessary to have 60 votes. I think that is unfortunate.

Last year, during the course of debating the Defense authorization 
bill, there were two major amendments related to the war in Iraq. Both 
of those amendments were considered and held to a majority vote 
standard. Earlier this year, on the supplemental appropriations bill 
for the war in Iraq, another question came up about change in policy--
again, a majority vote. But things have changed. Since that time, at 
least three Republican Senators have stepped forward and said they 
disagree with the President's policy and will vote to change the 
direction of this war. Because of that, it is clear we have a majority 
supporting this change in direction.

Now the Republican leader insists on 60 votes, insists on 
filibustering the amendment that is before the Senate. He is trying to 
stop the debate on whether we will change direction in Iraq. As a 
result, we are going to have an unusual session of this Senate which 
will commence shortly and run around the clock until tomorrow morning, 
when we will face a cloture vote. A cloture vote is an opportunity for 
Senators to step forward and say whether they truly want a change in 
the policy of this war. The Republican minority has insisted on this 
60-vote threshold, knowing it is more difficult to reach, but we 
haven't given up. We believe that with the three Republican Senators 
who have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the President's 
policy, others may join. We know that Republican Senators back in their


home States have said publicly and repeatedly they want to vote to 
change policy. They will have that chance on the Levin-Reed amendment, 
which will be brought up for a cloture vote tomorrow morning.

This session, which we will now commence, is not likely to end during 
the next 24 hours. During that period of time, it is an opportunity and 
an invitation for Members of the Senate to come to the floor and 
express their feelings about this war in Iraq. For those who support 
the President's position and want to continue along this present 
course, they have their chance. For those on both sides of the aisle 
who believe we ought to bring this war to an end, they also have their 
opportunity.

It is unfortunate the Republican minority has insisted on this 
procedural obstacle, has insisted on filibustering this amendment, and 
is trying to stop us from getting to the heart of the issue about 
changing this policy in Iraq. But the American people know this, and 
they know that those who are doing their best to protect the President, 
protect him politically, protect his position, are going to be well 
known across this country at the end of this debate.

I hope those who agree with us on the Democratic side and the three 
Republicans who join us will come together with us and dramatically 
change this policy, change this war in Iraq, and bring it to an end 
responsibly.

I yield the floor.
