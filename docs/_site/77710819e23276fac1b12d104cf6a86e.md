Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
reducing the cost of higher education and increasing access for all of 
those who dream of attending college, and that includes, Mr. Speaker, 
our servicemembers.

Our servicemembers face extraordinary challenges when activated to go 
to Iraq or Afghanistan while in college.

Under current law, those deciding not to return to school must begin 
to repay the loan immediately after returning home, and this means, as 
we all know, that they will receive their student loan bills in the 
mail within days of returning from a combat zone.

Among the other benefits in this bill, the College Cost Reduction Act 
includes an amendment to give those activated while in college a 13-
month deferment before they must begin repaying a student loan.

This bill is important, and it's important for this reason, because 
it provides our servicemembers the protections and the rights they 
deserve when activated while in college.

I urge my colleagues to support the overall legislation.
