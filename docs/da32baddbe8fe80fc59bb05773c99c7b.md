Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Like happens to you sometimes, my blood is 
starting to boil because all that it takes, I'm sitting here listening 
to this back and forth that we're going through here and example after 
example about the reasons for the American people's outrage, for our 
outrage, for our persistence in trying to move this iceberg and get 
some progress and end the blank check and establish some 
accountability.

You know, it's very simple. All the President has to do is be a 
diplomat himself and agree to come to the table and compromise and 
negotiate and end the my-way-or-the-highway politics. He is not king. 
Yes, he was elected President, but he was elected to one branch of the 
government, which, the way our government is set up, is designed to 
work coequally with this branch of government.

He has disdained the legislative branch, and this is the 
representative body of the United States of America. The people who 
elect us elect us to be their voice. They elect one person, an 
executive, and they elect 435 of us so we can have a collective 
diversity of opinion and that the result in terms of the outcome of 
policy is a combination of that diversity. And he has no respect for 
it, and that's why his numbers are where they are. That's why the 
support for this President, the bottom has dropped out of it.

And that's why over the next several months we will push this iceberg 
with all our might, and I can feel it, that their ability to continue 
unabated with the disdain and disregard that this administration has 
shown for the American people and our opinion, it will come to an end 
and it's going to come to an end in a fashion that we will help bring 
about the change that the American people ask for. And that is the only 
way that this is going to happen, if we continue to fight, we continue 
to push hard, we make sure that we go out to our communities like we 
will all do next week.

I know I'm having a town hall meeting next Wednesday in my district 
to talk specifically about the war in Iraq and how people feel about 
it, get their feedback, talk about the other issues that are important 
to them, because people are tired. They're tired of the war. They're 
sick of the deaths. They're sick of the death toll, and they want us to 
be able to talk about how we're going to expand health care.

We have the SCHIP program that we need to reauthorize later this 
year. We


have 9 million kids that we need to find the money to cover. We have to 
make sure we can reduce the cost of health care for small businesses. 
We have a deficit that has ballooned out of control, that we're trying 
to get a handle on, no thanks to our friends on the other side of the 
aisle.

We have a lot to do, a long to-do list, and it would be great if the 
President would just recognize that we all need to work together and 
end his disrespect for the American people and for the democratic 
process because it's gone on for far too long. And we have a lot at 
stake here.

And I just have reached my level of frustration. I know my 
constituents have, and that's why I'm proud of our caucus because we 
have hung together. We have stuck together and pushed and pushed and 
pushed each other so that we can get behind a policy that not all of us 
are 100 percent behind. Everybody didn't get their way with the 
legislation that we put forward with benchmarks and timelines. But you 
know what? That's what this representative body that we were elected to 
is all about. It's about compromise and it's about standing up for the 
people who don't have a voice. They elected us to be their voice and I 
have been very proud to be a Member of this institution, really proud 
of our Democratic leadership.


And I'm just hopeful that we can get beyond this war and start 
talking about things like the $3.22 a gallon that our constituents are 
paying, on average, for their gas as we approach the summer season as 
well.
