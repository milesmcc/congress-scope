Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, 
sacrifice, and heroism


of Army Private First Class Paul Orazio Cuzzupe II, of Plant City, 
Florida.

PFC Cuzzupe, an Army combat medic, was killed in the line of duty in 
Afghanistan on August 8th when his unit was attacked by an improvised 
explosive device.

U.S. Army combat medics are the battlefield's first responders, 
fearlessly providing first aid and basic medical care to those in 
desperate need. PFC Cuzzupe personified this bravery and compassion. In 
fact, a week before he died, PFC Cuzzupe was awarded the Army 
Commendation Medal for his tireless efforts to save life of an Afghan 
child that had been severely wounded by an insurgent's bomb.

Outside of the Army, Paulie--as he is known to his friends--was an 
outstanding young man in his own right. He had been an honor student at 
Armwood High School and was a talented self-taught guitarist who led 
his own rock band and performed songs for Sunday school students.

Madam Speaker, though proud to have such a fine example from the 
Tampa Bay community, it is with great remorse that I rise to 
commemorate the life of PFC Cuzzupe. I am in awe of the young men and 
women like Paul Cuzzupe who choose to serve their countrymen in the 
armed forces. I appreciate their professionalism and dedication. Their 
sacrifice, like that of PFC Cuzzupe will not be forgotten.
