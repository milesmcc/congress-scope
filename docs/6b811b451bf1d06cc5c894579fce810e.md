# UNITES STATES POLICY IN IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2007--S. J. RES. 9

`Mr. BOND â€” 15 March 2007`

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, while it is far too premature to declare 
that the new strategy has succeeded, it does indicate there is a 
possibility. As General Abizaid once testified, despair is not a 
policy. It must be given a chance to succeed, and this resolution would 
do nothing to achieve victory. The alternative of retreat and defeat 
would be disastrous.

What are my colleagues who wish to see us leave Iraq thinking will 
happen once we do? The arguments for retreating before relative 
security is established because we grow tired of the war, because 
mistakes were made or because Americans allegedly want us to leave all 
ignore what the consequences will be if we do leave precipitously on a 
political withdrawal timetable.

Those who are advocating for retreat and departure from Iraq 
absolutely must address this very difficult question. In other words, 
what is ''Plan Bravo,'' plan B, for those mandating retreat? Are we to 
redeploy forces back home only to have to redeploy them in much larger 
numbers 3, 4, 5 years from now, once Baghdad has turned into a base of 
operations and safe haven for al-Qaida? Will we endure the transfer of 
Islamofascist terrorism and violence occurring in the Middle East back 
to the homeland?

Mr. President, I ask for an additional 60 seconds.
