Mr. ADLER of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Lance 
Corporal Ryan M. Welch of Medford, New Jersey and to welcome him home 
from his recent tour of duty in Afghanistan.

After graduating from Shawnee High School in 2008, Ryan enlisted in 
the United States Marine Corps. He completed his basic training at 
Parris Island in South Carolina and went to Infantry Training at Camp 
Geiger, North Carolina. In 2009 he was assigned to MCB Hawaii Kaneohe 
Bay Oahu, Hawaii where he was meritoriously promoted to Lance Corporal. 
Lance Corporal Welch also received a Meritorious Mast during training 
exercises at Pohakuloa Training Area in July 2009 for demonstrating 
outstanding performance of duty during Exercise Lava Viper.

Lance Corporal Welch completed his first deployment to Afghanistan in 
support of Operation Enduring Freedom. During his deployment he served 
bravely in combat action during Operation Moshtarak in Marjah, 
Afghanistan. He served as an Infantry Rifleman in Jump Platoon, 
Headquarter and Service Company, 1st Battalion 3rd Regiment from Marine 
Corps Base Hawaii and as security for visiting dignitaries and 
performed general patrols and security for Nawa District, Hellmand 
Province in Afghanistan.

Madam Speaker, please join me and a grateful nation in welcoming home 
Lance Corporal Welch. We are eternally thankful to him for his service 
to our great country.
