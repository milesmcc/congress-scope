Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, in the coming days, the House will once 
again consider the new GI Bill which restores the promise of a 4-year 
college scholarship for Iraq and Afghan veterans, similar to the 
educational benefits available after World War II. The original GI Bill 
of 1944 allowed millions of families to achieve the American Dream and 
set the economy on the right course after a draining war.

After World War II, for every dollar spent on the GI Bill, $7 was 
returned to the economy. The new GI Bill will spark yet another 
American economic recovery, one that is needed during this time of 
economic uncertainty with skyrocketing gas prices and food prices and 
devastating job losses.

But even more importantly, it will fulfill our promise to our 
military personnel that if they serve their country in war, they will 
receive a quality education at home. The current benefit simply does 
not live up to that promise. Mr. Speaker, while President Bush and his 
Republican allies remain strong advocates for continuing the war in 
Iraq, it is important that they join us in keeping this important 
promise to our Nation's troops.
