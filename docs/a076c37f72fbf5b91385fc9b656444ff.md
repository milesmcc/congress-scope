Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that it is important to 
understand the context in which each of these debates occur.

I agree with my colleagues on other side of the aisle who would say 
that this debate is not the central debate in America today, whether or 
not we spend an excessive amount of money to accommodate one Member of 
the Congress who ought to be protected. That is not exactly the most 
momentous moment or issue before the Nation right now.

But next week we will debate the war in Iraq. Next week we will 
debate the confrontation of this Nation with global terrorism. Next 
week we will debate the jihadis and their desire to destroy America and 
the importance of that fight.

Now, here is my concern: you on the other side of the aisle are 
concerned that we are making a big deal out of this issue. I would like 
to know if somebody on the other side of the aisle will promise me that 
next week you will have an open rule on the Iraq debate so that we can 
have a full discussion of all of the issues, because I welcome that 
debate. But what I fear, what I fear deeply is that we will not have an 
open rule next week. We will not have a reasonable opportunity to 
debate all of the alternatives.
