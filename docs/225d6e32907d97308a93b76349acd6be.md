`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 23 January 2007`

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate that, because that is exactly what 
happens is you don't have the money, there was no pay-as-you-go in the 
last several Congresses, runaway spending, borrowing money from China. 
What does that mean? Well, here is our budget priorities for 2007 prior 
to Democrats taking office, budget into the billions of dollars. This 
red bar here is just interest on the money that we borrowed. This is 
not paying it down; this is just paying the interest on it. You know, 
you get your mortgage and you get your car loan and you open it up and 
you have got a 5 or $600 payment. You see $300 of it is actually going 
to the payment and the other stuff is interest, and it breaks your 
heart.

This is what the country is doing. But compare that to what we are 
doing, this is education, homeland security and veterans. This is going 
back to China; this is going back to some of those other countries.

And then you look and you see China says the test they did in space 
does not signal an intent to militarize space. You can't get the real 
facts on China's military budget, but they are buying a ton more ships. 
That is where that money is going.

I think it is important to make that point because it is not just 
money that just goes and floats out and the Federal Reserve tries to 
find it somewhere. It is going to China, it is going to the Middle 
East, it is going to OPEC countries.

And then we are funding both sides of the war on terror because we 
are buying all the oil, making them money. It gets back to the 
terrorists. And then we have a war in the Middle East and we pass 
almost $500 billion already that we are spending from our side already 
on the war in Iraq.
