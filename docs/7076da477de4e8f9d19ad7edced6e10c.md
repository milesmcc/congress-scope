Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the chair of the committee of 
jurisdiction, the highway trust fund is broke. As a result of that, 
there are roads being built and bridges being built and that is simply 
going to stop. The people there, going to work, in the near future are 
not going to be able to go to work anymore because there is no money to 
pay them.

I would also say this. One of the things that so concerns me about 
the Bush-Cheney-McCain operation is no one seems to care about all the 
red ink we have spent over the last 8 years. In Iraq alone we are 
spending $5,000 a second. During the time we have been here since this 
vote started, 40 minutes--I don't know how much money that is. I tried 
to figure out what it would be, 40 times 60 times 240. It is lots of 
money. Everything we have done this last 8 years has been basically 
done on borrowed money.

Here is a situation where the administration is asking us to take 
money from the general fund. They will borrow that money as they have 
done with everything here. That is why we have a $11 or $12 trillion 
debt. I cannot imagine that self-righteous people are all of a sudden 
wanting things paid for.
