Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today the House Armed 
Services Committee will examine the issue of body armor for our troops 
in combat. Fortunately, before going into recess for Memorial Day, 
Congress passed a critical war funding bill that will allow the 
military to purchase body armor and other equipment for our men and 
women in uniform.

I was grateful to visit with our troops during the break in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Everywhere we went, the troops thanked us for passing the 
legislation to provide for their being fully equipped.

Our soldiers are fighting the terrorists overseas so we do not have 
to face them again in the streets of America. We are protecting 
American families in stopping al Qaeda's threat to our Nation.

On the 63rd anniversary of D-day, we appreciate the new greatest 
generation. I am pleased Congress passed and President Bush signed a 
bill that will provide our military with the tools it needs without 
handcuffing our commanders on the battlefield.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
