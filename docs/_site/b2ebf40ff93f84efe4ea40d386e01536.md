Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the 
gentleman's amendment.

Mr. Chair, I want to be clear that I agree with the fundamental 
principle that every nation, including Israel, has the right to defend 
itself against an imminent military threat.

Unfortunately, this amendment goes far, far beyond that bedrock 
principle.

Nearly 8 years ago, I stood on this House floor and confronted a very 
similar issue. On that day, September 14, 2001, I voted against the 
authorization of use of United States force against Afghanistan because 
it granted the US a blank check to wage war any place and any time 
against any enemy. It went far beyond any authority granted for 
international war making.

Today this amendment raises the same issue and I am compelled to draw 
the same conclusion.

I was unable to support US government broad blank check power, in 
good conscience


I am not able to support that type of excessive authority for any other 
nation.
