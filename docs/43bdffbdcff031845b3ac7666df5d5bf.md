# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010

`Mr. COHEN â€” 1 July 2010`

---


Mr. COHEN. I thank Mr. McGovern for granting me the time and for 
bringing this amendment.

Mr. Speaker, you don't put good money after bad, and this would be 
putting good money after bad.

I was in this Hall earlier with Senator McGovern, in the Speaker's 
lobby, and I said something to Senator McGovern, former Senator 
McGovern.

He said, Did I hear Vietnam?

Well, the echoes of Vietnam are in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker. When 
people on the other side say they don't want to hear about surrender 
and that that is not right, we could still be in Vietnam, and we would 
still be losing American lives and American resources, because that was 
a war we couldn't win, and some people wouldn't accept it. So we lost 
more lives and more American economies and more opportunities in 
America.

My district cannot afford another $35 billion and $35 billion and $35 
billion in trying to create infrastructure in Afghanistan, which is not 
a Third World country, but probably like a fifth world country--the 
third most corrupt nation on the face of the Earth. That is not what 
the United States of America is known for doing--supporting corrupt 
countries around the world with a man like Karzai, whose brother is in 
the opium trade, with a country that predominantly benefits from the 
growing of poppies and from the spreading of heroin around the world. 
That is who we are supporting.

We should not be spending our money and our lives. I go to the 
funerals of every soldier in my district who passes, and I don't want 
to go to more of them. I stop every soldier I see in airports and ask 
them about where they are going.

When they are going to Afghanistan or to Iraq, I ask them, How is it 
going?

Almost all of them going to Afghanistan say, Not well. They look at 
me and they say, We should not stay there. We are not doing well.

I went to a function in my district in the west side, almost entirely 
African American, and to a person, we need to spend our money here. On 
the east side of my district, which is entirely Caucasian, and I asked 
this crowd of 30: Does anybody want me to go to Washington and vote for 
more funds for Afghanistan? Not one.

This war is lost. Bring our troops home. Save our money.
