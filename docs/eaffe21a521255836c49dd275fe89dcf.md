Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

The motion to instruct by my friend Mr. Hunter from California is in 
two parts. Both of these sections make reference to issues that are 
spelled out in both the House and Senate versions and consequently 
should be acceptable. I would hope that the conferees would be in line 
with accepting both of those issues.

I would like to take just a moment, Madam Speaker, however, to say a 
word about those wonderful troops who we, through this authorization, 
support. They are the best in the world. They and their families have 
been tasked to do monumental work in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, 
and to say we are proud of them is an understatement. General Petraeus 
is the right man for the job in his great efforts in Iraq.

That is why in this bill we authorize a 3/1/2/ percent pay raise for 
our troops; that is why we made significant changes to address the 
problems unearthed by the Walter Reed situation regarding our wounded 
warriors; that is why we put $1 billion in strategic readiness funds to 
deal with the critical readiness shortfall. And this is a major 
challenge for us. The reforms for Iraq and Afghanistan contracting are 
spelled out in this bill. There is additional money for the MRAP 
vehicles; there is $980 million for our National Guard equipment; 
prohibition on TRICARE fee increases; taking steps to minimize the 
inequities for survivors and to step forward on the survivor benefit 
plan offset.

So all of these are major issues within the realm of the two bills, 
and hopefully the conferees would be able to make significant progress 
on each of those.

I am proud of the work we have done. I am proud of the Armed Services 
Committee. I think it is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. 
Special thanks to the gentleman from California who has worked with us 
these many years to the end of positive help for the American in 
uniform.

So with that, I will reserve the balance of my time.
