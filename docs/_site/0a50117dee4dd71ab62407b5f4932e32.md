Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri), a new 
Member of this Congress, a new member of the Blue Dog Coalition, for 
coming and visiting with us this evening about the need for 
accountability and responsibility in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, as you know, the Blue Dog Coalition is about fiscal 
responsibility. It is about restoring common sense and fiscal 
discipline to our Nation's government, not only here at home, but also 
in Iraq. And that is why this week the Blue Dog Coalition will file a 
resolution that its coalition, the Blue Dog members, have endorsed to 
demand accountability in Iraq.

We read the resolution in its entirety at the beginning of this 
Special Order. Basically, we want a detailed accounting of how military 
and reconstruction funds in Iraq have been spent thus far, a detailed 
accounting of the types and terms of contracts awarded on behalf of the 
United States, including the methods by which such contracts were 
awarded and contractors selected; a description of efforts to obtain 
support and assistance from other countries toward the rehabilitation 
of Iraq. The U.S. should not be going this alone; an assessment of what 
additional funding is needed to complete military operations and 
reconstruction efforts in Iraq, including a plan for security in Iraq; 
a detailed plan for how any future funds will be spent; and a statement 
of how those funds will advance the interests of the United States in 
Iraq. Sanctions shall be imposed against contractors who have engaged 
in fraud or abuse or, yes, war profiteering.

We are calling for the creation of a Truman-like committee 
commissioned to conduct an ongoing study and investigation of the 
awarding and carrying out of contracts by the United States to conduct 
activities with regard to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and make such 
recommendations to the House as the select committee deems appropriate.

Funding requests for Operation Iraqi Freedom in fiscal year 2008 and 
beyond must come through the regular appropriation process, not through 
the so-called emergency supplementals; no more of not being 
accountable; no more hiding the true cost of the war.

And finally, the administration should firmly condition further 
American financial, military and political resources upon steady 
improvement in Iraqi assumption of principal responsibility for 
internally policing Iraq.

Now, why are we filing this resolution? Because our Nation has now 
spent over $400 billion, nearly a half a trillion, in Iraq. Total for 
2006, $100.4 billion; for the month, $8.44 billion; the cost per day, 
$275 million. And, Mr. Speaker, yes, each hour we are sending 
$11,458,333 of your tax money to Iraq. And we believe it is time for 
this Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to provide oversight 
on how this money is being spent.

I yield to my fellow Blue Dog member from California Mr. Costa.
