`Mr. REID â€” 3 April 2008`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have an interesting situation. We have a 
substitute amendment that has been laid down. We have worked hard to 
get it here. We started on the bill at 9:30 this morning. It is now 2 
o'clock. We have one amendment that has been laid down. I even tried to 
arrange a vote on a resolution honoring the 4,000 Americans who have 
been killed in Iraq. We can't even get that up for a vote. I don't know 
what is going on. We are going to work through this. I asked for a 
consent agreement that any amendments that would be offered would be 
related to the housing bill. No, we can't do that yet. I realize the 
majority we have is very slim, but we do have the majority and that 
gives us certain rights. I am going to exercise those rights.

I would like to have a housing bill. I think it is important to the 
country. I hope the American people see what we have put up with now 
during the last 15 months. Every step of the way is a struggle. We are 
not able to legislate. We are constantly trying to figure a way 
procedurally to get past the minority, which is still upset about the 
November 2006 elections. That is what this is all about. We are in the 
majority, as slim as it might be, and they have to get over this. Let 
us work together. We want to work. We want to pass things. My friend 
has offered an amendment.

Let's vote on it.
