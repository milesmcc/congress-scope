# DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007
## `c796b77597bc526a080bad958f6a0945`
`Mr. CONYERS â€” 22 March 2007`

Mr. CONYERS. This is the most startling double hypocrisy I have ever 
heard of on a bill of this magnitude. Very clever, whoever dreamed this 
up. The motion to recommit would deny everyone in this House the right 
to vote on whether citizens would gain the right to vote, and at the 
same time arm them with military-type weaponry that is being used in 
Iraq right now to destroy aircraft and bring down helicopters.

We would also repeal the District's strong ban on handgun ammunition 
that can pierce body armor worn by police officers and other law 
enforcement officials at a time when security has become a top priority 
in the District, making military-style assault weapons readily 
available.

Now, the most important person I have ever met in my life, with due 
respect to all the great people I have had the honor of working with as 
a Member of Congress, is Martin Luther King, Jr. If he is looking down 
on us now to see if we are working for justice and peace in our 
country, in our Capital and throughout the world, I am sure he would be 
as dismayed as I am by putting a gun control vote up for a motion to 
recommit.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. 
Davis.
