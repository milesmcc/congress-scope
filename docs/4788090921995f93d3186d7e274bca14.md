Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise on behalf of the 43 Member 
strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. We are a 
group of fiscally conservative Democrats that are committed to 
restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's 
government.

As you walk the Halls of Congress, Mr. Speaker, it is easy to know 
when you are walking by the office of a fellow Blue Dog Member because 
you will see this poster that says ''The Blue Dog Coalition.'' It says, 
''Today, the U.S. national debt is, 8,887,793,986,597.86.'' And for 
every man, woman and child in America, their share of the national debt 
is $29,465. It is what we refer to as the ''debt tax.'' And that is one 
tax that cannot be cut, that cannot go away until this Nation gets its 
fiscal house in order. The Federal deficit continues to climb.

Mr. Speaker, it is hard now to think back and realize, but from 1998 
through 2001, this country had a balanced budget; and yet under the 
Republican leadership for the previous 6 years, we have seen them 
rubber-stamp the President's budget year after year after year, giving 
us the largest deficit after the largest deficit after the largest 
deficit, record deficits. And as a result of that, we have seen the 
national debt grow to where it is today, approaching $9 trillion.

Why does this matter? It matters because the total national debt from 
1789 to 2000 was $5.67 trillion, but by 2010, the total national debt 
will have increased to $10.88 trillion. This is a doubling of the 211-
year debt in just 10 years. Interest payments on this debt are one of 
the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget. And the debt tax is 
one that cannot be repealed. Deficits reduce economic growth. They 
burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. They increase 
our reliance on foreign lenders who own some 40 percent of our debt.

This chart here, Mr. Speaker, graphically depicts why the American 
people should be concerned about the fact that our country is nearly $9 
trillion in debt. You see, our Nation spends a half a billion dollars a 
day, give or take a


few dollars, simply paying interest on the debt, and that is money that 
could be going for education, health care, veterans benefits, to 
properly equip our men and women in uniform and ensure that they've got 
the best body armor possible.

And this really graphically depicts it, as you can see. The red bar 
is the amount of money our Federal Government spends simply paying 
interest on the national debt. The light blue bar demonstrates how much 
money we spend educating our children. The green box indicates how much 
we spend on our veterans. And the purple box indicates how much we 
spend on homeland security. Again, you can see overwhelmingly our tax 
money is going to pay interest on the national debt.

It is time to get our fiscal house in order. It is time to restore 
common sense to our Federal Government. And once we do, we can begin to 
spend less of your hard earned tax money, Mr. Speaker, on paying 
interest on the national debt, and we can spend a lot more on educating 
our children, taking care of America's veterans, keeping our homeland 
secure, and the list of America's priorities goes on and on.

One of the co-chairs for the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue 
Dog Coalition is Allen Boyd from Florida. He is our administrative co-
chair. I am delighted that he has joined me this evening for this 
lively discussion about restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to 
our national government. And part of the way we do that, we believe, is 
through accountability.

Throughout the evening we are going to be talking about the budget, 
we are going to be talking about the debt and the deficit, we are going 
to be talking about accountability, not only at home, but also in Iraq, 
and making sure that the hardworking people of this country are getting 
the most for their tax dollar. I don't think that is asking too much. 
And I think it is very appropriate that on tax day we rise on the floor 
of the House to demand accountability for how the American taxpayer's 
money is being spent.

With that, I yield to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Boyd, the co-
chair for administration for the Blue Dog Coalition.
