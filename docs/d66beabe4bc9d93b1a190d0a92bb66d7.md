`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 21 July 2009`

---


Mr. LIEBERMAN. Two reasons. The first is that it is a bit beyond what 
Secretary Gates did. He authorized using the extraordinary powers he 
possesses as Secretary in this time of conflict up to 22,000 for the 
next 3 years. The amendment authorizes--doesn't mandate, doesn't 
appropriate--30,000 for the next 3 years. So it gives some latitude, 
depending on how conditions go in Iraq and Afghanistan, to go a bit 
further--8,000 more, if necessary, over the next 3 years.

Second, I say to my friend from Arizona, when this amendment started, 
we didn't know Secretary Gates was going to do this. I am grateful he 
did, but this amendment now--frankly, as Secretary Gates himself said 
to me yesterday, and I appreciate it and I don't think he would mind if 
I repeated it on the Senate floor--gives the Senate and Congress the 
opportunity to essentially vindicate and support the step that the 
Secretary has made and, as he put it, send a message from the Senate to 
the members of the U.S. Army that help is on the way.
