Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, several months ago the administration 
announced the so-called ''surge,'' or escalation of troops into Baghdad 
and the surrounding area. It was claimed by the administration that the 
escalation of over 2,800 more troops in Iraq was needed to get control 
of Baghdad and increase the security of the Iraqi people.

Just what has been the result of that claim? The exact opposite. 
Instead of control, we are seeing a surge in violence. We are seeing a 
surge in bombings and attacks. On one day alone, Wednesday of this past 
week, 171 Iraqis were killed in a wave of bombings. These were people 
going about their lives, going to the market, going to work, riding the 
bus; 171 people. They are not just a number, they are mothers, they are 
fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, neighbors and, yes, children.

The violence and brutality should not be ignored or swept under the 
rug or become just another statistic. These are people whose lives have 
been cut short.



You have to wonder if anyone in Iraq is safe anymore, especially when 
a bomber can enter the green zone and the parliament building to bomb 
the cafeteria. How can we expect Iraqi parents to send their children 
to school?

How could we imagine how much courage it takes just to go to the 
market around the corner from your home for food? Not to mention the 
bravery it must take to volunteer to serve as part of the Iraqi 
security force.

Our brave men and women in uniform are doing all they can do to 
provide security to the Iraqi people. It is not their fault that this 
security seems to be out of their reach. The fault lies entirely at the 
desk of one person, the Commander in Chief.

He is sending troops back for third and fourth tours of duty, and he 
has extended those tours by months. How many of those troops were 
provided sufficient training or body armor? How many are given access 
to mental health care? And once they make it home, how many were left 
in the squalor of Walter Reed hospital? This is unacceptable and 
against everything our country stands for.

Poll after poll has found that the Iraqis and the American public 
want an end to this occupation. Even this Congress has gone on record 
several times calling for an end to this occupation.

The administration seems to be the only one who wants to stay the 
course, but it is time to face the facts. The mission is not 
accomplished. We are not winning. More people are dying every single 
minute and every single hour and every single day we stay in Iraq.

I say enough is enough. Bring our troops home. I will not stop, I 
will not rest and I will not back down in my fight until every last 
soldier, Marine, airmen and sailor is home safe with his or her family.
