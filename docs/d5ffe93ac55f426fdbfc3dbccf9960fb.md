# CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO  MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
## `d5ffe93ac55f426fdbfc3dbccf9960fb`
`Mr. EMANUEL â€” 18 October 2007`

Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, Dolores Sweeney, from my district, works 
for an insurance company that doesn't provide health care for her or 
her children. She earns a paycheck, not a welfare check. She has three 
children and would like to buy private health care, but can't afford to 
do so.

Dolores Sweeney's children are on SCHIP, and without the SCHIP 
program they would go without health care, or she would have to go 
without a job.

Our bill does right by Dolores Sweeney and the other 10 million 
children from working families.

I believe that you care about the poor, but I wonder why you voted to 
cut $8 billion from Medicaid.

I believe that you think this is excessive cost, but you never said 
that about the $680 billion for Iraq, no questions asked.

And I believe that you say that this is a taxpayer-funded government-
run health care, just like the health care your kids get in the Federal 
Government program. This is exactly that.

I believe the sincerity of your positions; but time and again, when 
it came to standing up for poor kids, you cut Medicaid. When it came to 
excessive cost, you provided $680 billion for the war in Iraq. And when 
it comes to government-funded health care, if it's good enough for your 
kids, it's good enough for Dolores Sweeney's children.
