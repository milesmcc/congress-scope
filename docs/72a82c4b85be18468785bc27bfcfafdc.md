Mr. LEE of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon to honor a 
true American hero--U.S. Army Specialist Alan N. Dikcis, a native of 
Wheatfield, New York.

Sadly, this past Friday, March 5, while serving his second tour of 
duty, Specialist Dikcis lost his life when he was struck by a roadside 
bomb in Afghanistan.

Specialist Dikcis enlisted in the Army shortly after graduating from 
Niagara-Wheatfield High School in 2006, and had hoped to spend his 
career in the service.

He enjoyed spending his time outside, whether it was going for a hike 
or riding his motorcycle or four-wheeler, and he enjoyed spending time 
with those he loved--his family and friends.

As Specialist Dikcis's stepmother recently said, ''Alan loved being 
in the Army. He was proud of his work. He made us proud, he made his 
daughter proud.''

I ask that the house join me in thanking Specialist Dikcis for his 
honorable service to our great nation, and extend our condolences to 
his family and friends, who had Alan taken from them far too soon.
