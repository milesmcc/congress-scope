`Mr. BAIRD â€” 2 May 2007`

---


Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.

I appreciate the gentleman's comments about the budget deficit, and I 
would first suggest that the deficit rose to historic levels under the 
leadership of the former majority party, largest deficits in the 
history of this country, indeed, were accrued with President Bush and 
the former majority.

Looking to these studies, some of which are $10,000, now absolutely 
we must make sure that we spend all the taxpayer dollars wisely. But 
let me just share with you what the American Association for 
Advancement of Science, probably the most prestigious scientific body 
in this country, has said. Prohibiting specific grants sets a dangerous 
precedent for scientific research that has progressed and advanced for 
decades through freedom of inquiry into a broad spectrum of subjects. 
While congressional oversight of Federal programs is, of course, 
important, second-guessing peer review in this way could compromise the 
fabric of our public research enterprise one thread at a time. 
Therefore, we urge you to oppose such amendments.

Similar sentiments have been voiced by the Association of American 
Universities.

And I would be tempted to ask the gentleman from California, except 
he's already stated his piece, why he would be opposing research that 
has been supported by the United States Army Research Institute; that 
is seen as critical to the security of our troops serving in Iraq.

Now, my wager is the gentleman's saying to himself right now, I have 
no idea what the chairman is speaking about here. And that's the 
problem. When you look at a cursory examination of the title, or an 
abstract, you don't have an idea. That's why we have peer review.

Which particular study am I talking about? I'm talking about the 
Study of the Accuracy of Cross Cultural Understanding of Others' 
Emotions. What we are talking about here is if you're going to be 
dealing with people from another culture, and you misread their 
expression of emotions, it can cost you your life, your buddies their 
life, or the innocent civilians their lives. The U.S. Army Research 
Institute believes this is important, and they support the basic 
elements of this kind of study.

I also am not sure, the gentleman seems to suggest, it seems, that we 
here in the Congress, with a cursory evaluation of the abstracts from 
studies, should insert ourselves in the peer-review process. I wonder 
if the gentleman had looked at chemistry research or physics research 
in the same way, and do we really want to spend this body's time, and 
do you, sir, or you, sir, have the expertise to evaluate these studies? 
That's why we have a peer-review process. That's why we have a National 
Science Foundation. It is why we have a Science Foundation Board to 
direct us.

I absolutely agree that if taxpayer dollars are going to be spent on 
research, it is incumbent upon the scientist to do the research well, 
ethically, responsibly, and that it be relevant. But I do not believe 
it is the place of either side of this aisle to single out particular 
studies, as has been done in this case, and presume that with a 5-
minute examination we know better than peer reviewers who have the 
degrees in the relevant fields and have spent years studying them and 
have evaluated them. That is a dangerous precedent to set, and I would 
urge strongly opposition to this amendment and a similar one which will 
emerge shortly for the sake of our soldiers.
