votes:

Act--''yea.''

Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, and celebrating her life and contributions to 
the people of the United States--''yea.''

Roll No. 689 on H. Res. 535, Commending David Ray Ritcheson, a 
survivor of one of the most horrific hate crimes in the history of 
Texas, and recognizing his efforts in promoting Federal legislation to 
combat hate crimes--''nay.''
