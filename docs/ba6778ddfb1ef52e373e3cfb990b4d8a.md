Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman for that commentary, especially the 
update on the hearing today from the GAO and Mr. Walker.

I will be a little more pointed to tell you as the ranking member of 
the appropriations subcommittee that funds the GAO, and funds Mr. 
Walker's organization, that unfortunately many times, whether it is 
government spending or oversight in Iraq, a lot of what happens in his 
office revolves around him and not us.



It is all about him, and again today, it's all about him. He's the 
only one that somehow can be unbiased, and he's the only one that can 
do this. And there's a little kingdom over at the GAO and he's the 
king. And we need to remember that and put it in perspective this week 
before we hear from the absolute expert on counterinsurgency in modern 
world history, David Petraeus, the best we can put in charge. He's the 
best we can offer to this situation. And let's listen to him 
objectively and not get caught up in an ego matter, frankly, involving 
Mr. Walker.

And I yield to the gentleman from Colorado, a distinguished member of 
our Veterans' Affairs Committee, a relatively new Member, but a very 
experienced and seasoned Member, Doug Lamborn.
