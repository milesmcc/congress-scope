Mr. MEEKS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I think we all owe a great debt 
of gratitude to the Speaker of this House and to the Democratic 
leadership for allowing us the opportunity to have every Member come to 
the floor of the people's House to talk about Iraq and whether or not 
they agree with the President's escalation. I think that is what this 
House is about, and one of the Members of that leadership who we do owe 
that gratitude to is the Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus, and I am 
pleased to yield 5/1/2/ minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut, the 
Honorable John Larson.
