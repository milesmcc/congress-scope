Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday former Vice President Cheney made 
the latest in a series of outrageous attempts to rewrite history. He 
suggested that America was less safe now than under President Bush. 
Well, as a former journalist and editor, I'm compelled to do a little 
rewrite of his story.

I think it is important to note that under President Bush and Vice 
President Cheney, we let Osama bin Laden escape. We took our eye off 
the ball in Afghanistan and moved to Iraq. We went into Iraq with no 
plan for victory. We heard from Vice President Cheney that we were 
going to be greeted as liberators, that WMD would certainly be found, 
and that this war was going to be very short and cost us very little 
money.

My editing of Vice President Cheney's statement on Sunday would be 
that he did not exactly tell the whole story.

Fortunately, the American people know the whole story. They know that 
we are much safer now with President Obama in the White House. So as 
the recently departed Paul Harvey would have said, ''And now you know 
the rest of the story.''
