Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may 
consume.

Small businesses are this country's economic drivers, yet they 
continually face challenges that make it hard for them to succeed in 
today's marketplace. Entrepreneurs are already dealing with rising 
energy and health care costs as well as the increasing regulatory 
burden. The last thing they need is for accessing affordable capital to 
be another barrier in the way of their success.

What we continue to see is a steady increase in costs and a decrease 
in access for the very programs that are intended to help 
entrepreneurs. Over the


past 2 years, for the 7(a) program alone, costs have doubled for 
smaller loans, and the average loan size has declined by 37 percent.

A recent study released by the National Small Business Association 
found that access to capital is the number two concern for 
entrepreneurs. This means that it is more of a concern than taxes and 
even the regulatory burden.

The Small Business Lending Improvements Act of 2007 is a bipartisan 
effort introduced by Ms. Bean and Mr. Chabot. This bill will make loans 
more economical, while providing long-term stability for small business 
owners.

H.R. 1332 touches all aspects of the SBA lending initiative, 
including the 504 program.

Not only will this legislation put affordable financing back into the 
hands of entrepreneurs, but will also accomplish a number of important 
public policy initiatives. H.R. 1332 provides incentives for medical 
professionals to locate in low income areas, establishes a rural lender 
program, and allows for veterans to secure funds to start or expand 
their firms.

With the number of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, the 
need for affordable financing is more important than ever. When 
Congress passed the GI bill, we made a commitment to education and 
homeownership for veterans. Today we have an opportunity to show our 
commitment to their entrepreneurial endeavors.

Small businesses must have the ability to continue spurring economic 
growth and creating jobs. For these reasons, H.R. 1332 has the support 
of American Community Bankers, Independent Community Bankers of 
America, American Veterans, Credit Union National Association, National 
Small Business Association, Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Bankers 
Association, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce and the American Dental Association.

I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the Small Business Lending 
Improvements Act of 2007.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
