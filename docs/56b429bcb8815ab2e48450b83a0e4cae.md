Mr. WOLF. I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairwoman for accepting the 
amendment. I appreciate it very much. I thank Mr. Shays for offering 
it. I think this is really the way the country is going to go.

There may be a vote here. Mr. Udall and other Members, along with Mr. 
Shays and Mr. McCaul, have a bill in to make the Iraq study the policy 
for the Nation.

I want to thank the gentlewoman for accepting it and thank Mr. Shays.
