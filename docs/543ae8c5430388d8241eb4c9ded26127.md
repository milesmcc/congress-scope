Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, if you are a young man or young woman in 
either Iraq or Afghanistan in American uniform, you would like to know 
that monies authorized and appropriated from this body for Iraq or 
Afghanistan will not be diverted to planning any operations elsewhere. 
That's what this is. This simply ensures that funds that Congress 
approved for other purposes are not diverted to planning operations 
against Iran. It's that simple.

It increases the ability of Congress to provide oversight for 
planning of military operations, and it would not restrict the 
Department of Defense from planning any necessary contingencies 
regarding Iran using the base defense budget.

This is a good amendment, and I compliment the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Andrews) for offering it.
