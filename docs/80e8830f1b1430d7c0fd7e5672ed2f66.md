`Mr. DREIER â€” 12 July 2007`

---


Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to close the debate now, so I 
yield myself the balance of the time.

Mr. Speaker, let me just begin by talking about procedure. We 
continue


to hear the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules talk 
regularly about an open amendment process, and I will say with absolute 
certainty, I had the privilege of chairing the Rules Committee for 8 
years, and I will tell you that we have brought more rules to the floor 
of this House under a completely closed process during the first 7 
months of this year than we did during any 7 months during the 8 years 
that I was privileged to serve as chairman of the Rules Committee. So 
much for a new and open process.

Now, let's look at what it is we're considering here, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, we know full well that this is a bill, unlike resolutions 
that may have been brought up under closed rules in the past, this is 
actually a bill, a bill that's scheduled to go to the President's desk. 
Everyone knows that this bill is not going to become law.

What we've found is gross politicization once again, a commitment 
made that every week we're going to have some kind of vote on Iraq.

We all know that the war in Iraq is very unpopular. We know that the 
President is a great punching bag on this for virtually everyone, but 
the fact of the matter is we are in the midst of a very important 
global war on terror, and as the President said in the past, you know, 
we all like to be loved, but I'd much rather be right than be loved.

The fact of the matter is, we want to bring this war to an end. The 
President stood right here in this chamber in January and said I wish 
that this war were over and that we had won, but we need to ensure 
victory. And, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, we are not given the 
opportunity to consider any thoughtful, bipartisan alternative to this 
measure which calls for the withdrawal to begin within 120 days. I 
mean, how crazy is that when we're looking for a report to come in 
September and as we are looking at success that has begun even after 
only 1 month, 1 month of this plan having been put into place under the 
greatly heralded General David Petraeus?

Now, Mr. Speaker, as my friends from New Mexico and Michigan have 
said, I'm going to move to defeat the previous question. I'm going to 
move to defeat the previous question so that we can actually ensure 
that we have the tools to win this war on terror. We've had a number of 
anniversaries marked. We've spent a lot of time talking about them, but 
we fail to remember the success that we've had at preempting attacks on 
this country.

Just last month, we marked the first anniversary of the discovery of 
the proposed attack on the Sears Tower and the FBI headquarters in 
Miami.

Just last week, we marked the first anniversary of the proposed 
attack on the plan to blow up the Hudson River tunnel between New 
Jersey and Manhattan.

Just in May, we had a report of the plan, as you all know, to see 
some of these people go in and start killing our people at Fort Dix in 
New Jersey.

And then of course, just a few weeks ago, we had the plan to blow up 
JFK International Airport.

Well, Mr. Speaker, we've been able to discover those, but we know 
full well from those in our intelligence operations and the Department 
of Homeland Security that we are, as Mr. Hoekstra said, blind and deaf, 
and I believe that we need to make sure we defeat the previous question 
so that we'll be in a position to amend this proposal so that we can 
ensure that we have the tools necessary to win this war on terror.

So vote ''no'' on the previous question.
