Mr. SALAZAR. I was in the Soviet Union during the fall of communism 
when Gorbachev was still in power in 1989, when we were out there 
studying international government with the Colorado Agriculture 
Leadership Program.

It's true, I couldn't agree with you more, that the spirit of 
democracy has to come from within, from within a country. They want to 
have it. They want to want it. A perfect example of how you win a war, 
it's with the spirit of sheer military force, but you also have to have 
a diplomatic surge as well. That is what Blue Dogs are asking for. They 
are asking to adopt the Iraqi Study Group recommendations. Sure, we can 
support a group surge, but coupled with a diplomatic surge. That is how 
you win wars. But they have to want it.
