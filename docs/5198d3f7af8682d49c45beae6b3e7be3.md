`Mr. REID â€” 6 February 2007`

---


Mr. REID. I say to my friend that the only thing I sense this 
afternoon--and I have to say it with a smile on my face, and I hope 
everyone recognizes this--is that every piece of legislation we have 
brought up, the Senator from New Hampshire has tried to throw a monkey 
wrench into it. It happened on ethics, it happened on the minimum wage, 
and now on this Iraq issue.

I guess my dear friend, who has a stellar political record as 
Governor, Member of the House of Representatives, United States 
Senator, chairman of the Budget Committee--and I have commented for the 
record many times about my admiration for him, but I guess he is the 
designated ''see if we can mess up the legislation'' guy this year. I 
would hope in the future to get somebody I don't care so much about 
because it is hard for me to try to oppose my dear friend from New 
Hampshire. Maybe when they do this every couple of months they will 
change.
