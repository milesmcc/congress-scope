Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, when our Nation is at war, it is our 
government's responsibility to provide the best protection and care for 
the men and women who willingly volunteer to serve in our armed 
services.

Now as we enter the fifth year of the Iraq war, it is no secret that 
the administration's strategy has dangerously eroded our military 
readiness. Troops are being sent overseas without the proper training, 
equipment and armor necessary to keep them safe.

And as the conditions at Walter Reed's Building 18 starkly testify, 
we must bring much more attention and support to our troops when they 
return home.

Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress is committed to supporting 
our men and women in uniform. The supplemental legislation coming 
before this House will provide an additional $1.7 billion for military 
health care, including conditions at Walter Reed, $1.7 billion for 
veterans health care, $2.5 billion for improving the readiness of our 
troops, and $1.4 billion for military housing. As long as they are at 
war, our troops deserve our support.
