Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Just in response, I understand where Mr. Barton is coming from. But I 
just want to point out that we do have bipartisan support in the House 
on the bill. And it is only a temporary measure that lasts for 1 year 
and provides immediate relief to these physicians that are going 
overseas and fighting for the country. It is a very special 
circumstance, which I don't think provides any real precedent here, 
because we do have these physicians who are going to serve their 
country in Iraq and we just don't want them to have a situation where 
they come back and they don't have any medical practice. I just don't 
think that is fair.

I would mention to the ranking member that if we wanted to make a 
permanent change in this, we would be sure to spend more time and work 
with our Republican colleagues in accomplishing that goal. This is a 
temporary measure, and it is just because of the circumstances.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson) 
such time as he may consume.
