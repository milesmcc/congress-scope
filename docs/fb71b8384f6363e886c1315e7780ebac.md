# EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `fb71b8384f6363e886c1315e7780ebac`
`Mr. LEVIN â€” 5 February 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we owe our troops everything. We owe them 
the best equipment we can provide. We owe them the best training. We 
owe their families the best support we can give them.

We also owe them our best thinking. I think it is an insult to the 
intelligence of our troops to suggest that debating the wisdom of 
deepening the military presence in Iraq somehow or other emboldens the 
enemy. Our troops depend upon us to give them what they deserve: 
support. And part of that support in a democracy is debating the policy 
which not only brought them there but which keeps them there and, if 
many of us are correct, will keep them there longer and with greater 
casualties. The best way to change course in Iraq is to adopt the 
modified Warner language.

It has been said that this is not as strong as withholding funds. We 
don't want to withhold funds from troops in the field. We want to 
change this policy. If you want to change the policy this 
administration is following, which relies on a military solution, a 
deepening military presence in Iraq, we hope you will vote for cloture 
on this bill.

I yield the floor.
