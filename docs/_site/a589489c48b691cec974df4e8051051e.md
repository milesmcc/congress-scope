`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 17 September 2008`

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. A lot of us were saying in the 2004 elections that 
if you re-elect President Bush, you will not recognize this country in 
4 years. And sad to say, here we stand, here we sit in America 
thinking, you know, the stock market is under 10,000, unemployment is 
up again. We borrowed $3 trillion. President Bush and the Republican 
Congress have borrowed more than any previous administration in 
Congress, combined. Still $10 billion a month in Iraq, and no end in 
sight with what's going on. It's getting to the point where we can't 
recognize what we're doing, and it's critical what's happening to this 
country. It's sad what they have done.
