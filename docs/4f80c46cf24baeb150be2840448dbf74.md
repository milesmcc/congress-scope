Mr. ROSS. As you can see from the chart here, let me just work 
through it with you. With the enactment of fiscal year 2007 
appropriations, Congress has approved a total of about $378.5 billion 
for military operations initiated since the 9/11 attacks. According to 
the Congressional Research Service, this number will continue to 
escalate over the next several years.

The cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom alone cost American taxpayers 
$2.5 billion in 2001 and 2002, $51 billion in 2003, $77.3 billion in 
2004, $87.3 billion in 2005, and $104.2 billion in 2006. You see a 
trend here. The cost of the war continues to go up.
