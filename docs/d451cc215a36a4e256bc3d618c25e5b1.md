# DEFENDING SENATOR REID

Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I just happened to be on the floor when I 
heard the last speaker talking about Senate majority leader Harry Reid 
and condemning his comments.

I have known Senator Reid since I was a high school senior at Valley 
High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. I don't know a public servant who has 
devoted more of his life to this country, his State and his community 
than Senator Harry Reid.

Now, I can't account for everything this man has ever said, but to 
get on the floor of the House of Representatives and condemn a true 
patriot, somebody who cares passionately about his fellow citizens and 
somebody that stays awake at night because of the loss of life and limb 
in Iraq, to condemn that person on the floor of the House of 
Representatives I think is a disgrace. And if I didn't stand up and say 
something, I would never forgive myself.
