Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, as one who opposed the invasion of Iraq and as 
one who has led efforts to end the occupation of Iraq, I rise today to 
support the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations 
Act of 2007.

First, I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairmen Obey and Murtha 
for really crafting this historic legislation that takes the first step 
to end the occupation of Iraq. This bill's main purpose, main purpose, 
is to begin to fund the end of this occupation.

This is also the very first time that this Congress will explicitly 
tie funding to bringing our troops home. It mandates a start date for 
the President to begin redeployment of our brave troops within 30 days 
of his signature. It also once again puts Congress on record 
prohibiting the establishment of permanent military bases and United 
States economic control of Iraqi oil and also of torture.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not perfect. I strongly feel that 
there should be additional clarity on the numbers and nature of U.S. 
forces that remain for protection of diplomats and training of Iraqi 
forces. And given the President's determination to protect his legacy 
by allowing the occupation to continue indefinitely, we really must be 
wary of providing him opportunities to prolong or extend this war.

So we made sure in this legislation that this bill explicitly states 
that ''the primary purpose of this $5 billion should be to transition 
the mission, redeploy troops in Iraq, and not to extend or prolong the 
war.''

But I am also disappointed that the end date in this legislation is a 
goal no later than December 2008. But hopefully, the Senate will pass 
this and send it to the President.

This legislation does conform to what Congresswomen Waters, Woolsey 
and myself have been working on all year. Earlier this year, we 
authored the Lee amendment that stipulates funding for Iraq should be 
used to fully fund, fully fund, the safe and orderly redeployment of 
our troops from Iraq. We did this way back in March. Now, 92 Members of 
Congress wrote to the President to put him on notice to this effect. So 
I am glad this remains the main purpose of this legislation.

This legislation represents for many of us a very important step 
forward to end the combat operations in Iraq. Otherwise, believe you 
me, I would never vote for it.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation does not give the President a blank 
check for his occupation. It provides a down payment on redeploying our 
troops from Iraq and ending the occupation. It clearly says these funds 
are to be used to begin to end the death, the violence, and the 
destruction that the Bush administration has brought on Iraq, which he 
has brought on our brave young men and women, and our country and the 
world.
