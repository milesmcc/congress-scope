`Mr. CASEY â€” 14 May 2010`

---


Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about the 
visit this week by Afghan President Karzai and many of his ministers, 
as well as the policy that is unfolding all these many months in 
Afghanistan.

I rise in the midst of a debate we are having in the Senate on 
financial reform and continuing efforts and strategies to be put in 
place to create jobs. Even in the midst of all those domestic concerns 
that are economic in nature--and we are still very concerned about and 
working on the problems of those who are out of work--we need, in that 
context, to also be concerned about what is happening in Afghanistan. 
So I wish to discuss President Karzai's visit and, as I mentioned, the 
visit, as well, by other Afghan government officials.

The other reason I rise in connection with that topic is to talk 
about the continuing threat our troops face from improvised explosive 
devices known by the acronym IEDs. They continue to pose a threat to 
our troops, and we have to continue to be concerned about the nature of 
that threat.

In a broader sense, when it comes to this policy, we have to get this 
right. We have to make sure our government is continually focused on 
getting this strategy right in Afghanistan, as it relates to security, 
governance, and development--all aspects of the strategy, working with 
our coalition partners in doing that.



First and foremost, on the question of IEDs, the Los Angeles Times 
reported last week that three-fifths of the 602 combat-related deaths 
of U.S. troops in Afghanistan were due to roadside bombs, the so-called 
IEDs, improvised explosive devices. The primary ingredient in these 
bombs is ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can also be used as an 
explosive. We know this from our recent history.

We also know we have some domestic history to consider. Timothy 
McVeigh used a 4,800-pound ammonium nitrate bomb to attack the Alfred 
Murrah building in Oklahoma City in April of 1995.

The Afghan Government has recognized this problem--the use of 
ammonium nitrate--and has begun working with coalition troops to crack 
down on the use of ammonium nitrate. It is no longer legal in 
Afghanistan to use ammonium nitrate in farming, and Afghan farmers 
receive training on how to use other types of fertilizer.

During yesterday's press conference President Karzai had with 
President Obama, he discussed the use of ammonium nitrate and, in 
particular, its impact on U.S. troops. I was glad he did that. I am 
glad President Obama has been focused on this issue as well. I had a 
chance yesterday, in a lunch with a small group of Senators, to ask 
President Karzai directly about this issue. So we talked about it 
yesterday at lunch as well.

Despite this ban in Afghanistan, ammonium nitrate manages to make its 
way to Afghanistan, reportedly from Pakistan. The Los Angeles Times 
reported that transport routes are lined with corrupt Pakistani police 
officers--according to the Los Angeles Times--and border officials who 
accept bribes to allow this smuggling to occur. This smuggling is a 
lucrative enterprise. One Pakistani businessman reported making almost 
$950 a month smuggling ammonium nitrate for use in Afghanistan. This is 
a country where the monthly average income is $216 a month.


I urge the Pakistani Government to track and regulate the transport 
of this dangerous material. The government appears to recognize that 
ammonium nitrate could also pose a threat to Pakistan's national 
security as extremists across the country step up their activities 
there as well. As in Afghanistan, it is important for the authorities 
in Pakistan to first show the political will to address this problem, 
and to put in place proper legal mechanisms to diminish its use across 
the border in Afghanistan.

Ammonium nitrate's use in IEDs is the main killer of U.S. troops in 
Afghanistan. We must do all we can--all we can--to limit its use.

I understand that if ammonium nitrate did not come from Pakistan, 
smugglers would identify new sources from other bordering countries. 
While this may be the case, it appears as though the primary source 
today is Pakistan. In this case, Pakistan is where we should focus our 
attention. So let's get at the supply of ammonium nitrate. Let's make 
it much harder for terrorists to kill U.S. troops.

Let me move next to the overall policy in Afghanistan. I was honored 
to be one of seven or eight Senators to have lunch yesterday with 
President Karzai. During his time in Washington, we were all pleased--I 
think both sides of the aisle in the Senate were pleased--that 
President Karzai reiterated his commitments to improving governance and 
reducing corruption. They are commitments, but I think the people of 
Pennsylvania and the people across America need to see results from 
those commitments. I also hope President Karzai will restate his 
support for NATO efforts to win back the country from the Taliban and 
drive the insurgents to the negotiating table.

In a meeting with Afghan Government ministers on Wednesday, five or 
six other Senators and I emphasized the importance of women's rights in 
Afghanistan. Afghan women play a key role in the decisionmaking 
process. Any peace process or agreement that does not respect and 
uphold the rights of half of the population--the women--of Afghanistan 
will fail to achieve long-term goals for security and stability.

In February, Senator Boxer and I cohosted a Senate Foreign Relations 
Subcommittee hearing on the future of Afghan women and girls. At that 
hearing, Melanne Verveer, the U.S. Ambassador at Large for Women's 
Issues, testified about the challenges Afghan women and girls face. She 
said:




 Perhaps the greatest remaining impediment to women's full 


 civic participation is violence against women and girls, 


 which remains endemic in Afghan society. Crimes go unpunished 


 because of anemic rule of law and weak institutions of 


 justice. Approximately 80 percent of crimes and disputes are 


 settled through traditional justice mechanisms.


So said Melanne Verveer, who knows of what she speaks.

This is a continuing problem. It is not just a moral problem. This is 
a problem long term for us as well because if the women of 
Afghanistan--women and girls--are not treated with respect, are not 
accorded the kind of rights and being given the benefit of a system of 
justice that will protect them, then our whole strategy in Afghanistan 
is undermined.

We cannot just win this on the battlefield. This is not just about 
the military. There are two other aspects that are so important to this 
strategy: governance and development. Of course, when you are talking 
about governance, you are talking about a system of justice. If half 
the population is the continued target of violence, and if half the 
population is not accorded basic rights and given the benefit of a 
functioning system of justice, our strategy in Afghanistan will fail.

This is a problem, not only because of the current concern we have 
about how women and girls are treated in Afghanistan and around the 
world, as well as here in the United States--that is the main reason 
for our concern--but it is also connected directly, and I think is 
inextricably intertwined, with our strategy as it relates to governance 
in Afghanistan.

We know that since the fall of the Taliban, there have been some 
improvements in women's rights, such as the creation of the Ministry 
for Women's Affairs and the guarantee of equal rights for men and women 
in the new constitution. Indeed, Afghan women remain among the worst 
off in the world with respect to life expectancy as well as quality of 
life. So even though progress has been made, we need to see a lot more 
in the way of results.

I am encouraged by the recent measures undertaken at the top of 
Afghanistan's Government to include the voices of women in the 
consultation process leading up to the Peace Jirga. However, I believe 
it is essential the Afghan Government take immediate measures--
immediate measures--to include qualified women, who have a record of 
public service--civic or community service--in meaningful senior roles 
at every level of the government and in the peace process.

We were--I know I was; and many of us were--very impressed by the 
women we met who are active participants in the Afghan Government. But 
much more needs to be done.

Let me move next to more of the military aspects of our strategy: 
both in Marjah--the operation that took place over the last couple of 
months--as well as the upcoming operations in Kandahar.

On April 29, the Pentagon released its biannual report to Congress on 
the last 6 months in Afghanistan. By all accounts, it was sobering. The 
report portrays an Afghan Government with limited credibility among its 
people. In 92 districts assessed for their support of the Afghan 
Government or their antagonism to it, not one supported the government, 
not one in 92. I realize that sometimes when a report comes out, it is 
dated and it may be that improvements may have been made over the last 
couple of months, but the most recent report was not good in terms of 
support for the Afghan Government.

Again, our strategy will not be successful unless the Afghan 
Government can improve those numbers of support from its own people. 
This is an important issue that President Karzai and the rest of the 
government must continue to address. I think they are taking steps to 
do that but much more needs to be done.

The Pentagon report highlights one positive development: The Taliban 
is seen by 52 percent of Afghans as the chief cause of instability. So 
the message is getting out to the people about the destructive impact 
of the Taliban. This perception provides the Afghan Government with an 
opportunity to show itself as the protector of the people.



One area in which ISAF and international aid donors can help build 
public confidence in their government is food security and 
distribution. Not only is the agricultural sector critical to the well-
being of all Afghans, both agriculture and food distribution are caught 
up in the problems raised by Afghan dependence on opium cultivation, 
extortion, and corruption in aid and transport operations for that, as 
well as manipulation by national and local power brokers.

The United States has begun shaping operations, mostly political, in 
and around Kandahar to prepare for the next major military campaign. 
While we can apply the lessons learned in Marjah, the Kandahar campaign 
will be a formidable test of our counterinsurgency plan. Kandahar is 
the second largest city in Afghanistan, the birthplace of the Taliban, 
and the Taliban still has considerable support there.

In judging the success of Kandahar from Washington, we should be 
aware of the significant political and cultural complexities because of 
the coalition's need to shift between fighting and outreach in 
Afghanistan. The contest for public sentiment among Afghan civilians 
will arguably be more important over the long run than the relative 
effectiveness of each side's military skill.

A functioning government which maintains credibility in the eyes of 
the people of Afghanistan will be necessary if civil military strategy 
is going to have any chance of success. We must continually stress the 
movement toward this goal so as not to lose sight of our objectives in 
Afghanistan. Again, we have to be concerned about three things: first, 
military concerns and the strategy as it relates to the military 
campaigns; second, governance; and third, development.

The ability of nongovernmental organizations and other aid 
organizations to do great work is hampered by corruption and the 
ineffectiveness of the government. Militarily removing the Taliban 
influence must be accompanied by the timely and effective delivery of 
emergency aid and refugee assistance. It is only when the government 
has the capacity to operate in an effective manner that all the tools 
can be applied to increasing the quality of life of local Afghans as 
well as presenting an alternative to the Taliban's form of rule.

The upcoming operations in Kandahar will be the largest to date aimed 
at securing the population through General McChrystal's population 
centric civil-military strategy. However, if the government is not 
capable of providing the capacity necessary to follow the military 
clearing operations, the strategy will not succeed.

Our brave men and women who serve this country deserve a reliable 
partner in the Afghan Government. We must work assiduously and 
continually to realize this vision of a peaceful and stable 
Afghanistan.

In conclusion, first of all, I wish to thank President Karzai for 
what he said here in the United States, what he did here to reiterate 
the goals we have, the partnership between our government and his 
government to get this policy right. After my two visits to Afghanistan 
in 2008 and 2009, I have been very critical of President Karzai. I must 
say, based upon the last couple of months, based upon the work he did 
here, the statements he made, and some actions he has taken, I have 
more cautious optimism, I will say, than I had before about his ability 
to move forward, helping us on this strategy; his ability to build 
confidence, the confidence of his own people; his ability to have a 
positive impact not only as it relates to our military strategy but, of 
course, especially governance as well as the development after military 
campaigns take place. I also appreciate the fact that President Karzai 
showed great respect not only for our fighting men and women in the 
field and their families but especially for those who gave, as 
President Lincoln said a long time ago in Gettysburg, the last full 
measure of devotion to their country when he visited the graves of some 
of those who perished in that conflict.

So we have reason to be more optimistic, but the test will be over 
time and based upon real results, facts on the ground as it relates to 
the military operations, governance, and development. So this strategy 
bears a lot of scrutiny.

In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 
a Los Angeles Times story of May 3, 2010, entitled ''Key Bomb 
Ingredient is Smuggled in Freely in Pakistan.''
