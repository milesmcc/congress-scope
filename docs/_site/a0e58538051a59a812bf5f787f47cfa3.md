Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 
seconds.

Mr. Chairman, one of the very exciting parts of this legislation, as 
pointed out by Mr. McKeon, is the full integration of our veterans into 
national service.

Today, earlier, we heard from Captain Scott Quilty, who is a 
decorated infantry captain and Army major retired who lost both his 
legs and one of his arms in Iraq. Scott has come back to assume the 
management responsibilities for Survivor Corps, a U.S.-based program 
that serves the needs of servicemembers and veterans returning from 
Iraq and Afghanistan. And Survivor Corps spoke in strong support of 
this legislation, recognizing that we now are extending full 
partnership to the veterans of this country, thanking them for their 
services, and providing services to them as they return home.

I yield 1/1/2/ minutes to a leader in service, the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Lewis).
