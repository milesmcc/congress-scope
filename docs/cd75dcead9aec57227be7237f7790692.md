Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I offered this resolution on the 
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill about 
10 days ago, and it was objected to at that time, so that is the reason 
I am back again today and yesterday. It took until today for our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle to come up with some reason 
not to support this amendment which condemns this ad against this four 
star general who wears the uniform of the U.S. Army and commands 
170,000 soldiers currently serving in harm's way in Iraq.

There is too much venom and too much poison in the political arena 
today. I do not like it any more than my colleagues on the other side. 
But we have a tradition in this country of, after the campaigns are 
over, trying to work together in the best interests of the American 
people. That is what we all try to do despite our differences, despite 
our party affiliation. But I would think we ought to rise up 
unanimously and condemn this character assassination of General 
Petraeus. And the fact


that political campaigns in 2002 and 2004 involved ads that I think we 
all would find over the line as far as the political discourse in a 
contested election should not detract from or dilute our condemnation 
of this particular ad.

You know, there is an unfortunate trend in our society today by 
people refusing to take personal responsibility for their conduct by 
saying: Well, we ought to condemn everybody, as if we should not 
condemn those individuals and those organizations which have clearly 
crossed the line in this case by saying: Well, we have to condemn 
everybody.

Well, I think this is the place to start, by condemning this ad, this 
irresponsible ad run in the New York Times at a discount by that 
organization, by that business entity, in favor of MoveOn.org, for the 
kind of ad I would hope we would unanimously condemn. Rather than 
relitigating political campaigns in the past, my hope is we would vote 
for this amendment and vote against the Boxer amendment.
