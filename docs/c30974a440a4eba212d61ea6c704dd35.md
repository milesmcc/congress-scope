`Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ â€” 20 June 2007`

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, they also talked about earmark 
reform. They were railing on and on about earmark reform.

Who brought earmark reform to Congress? We did. Who brought about the 
beginning of the end of the war in Iraq, hopelessly mired in a chaotic 
conflict in another country? If you rewind back to pre-November 7, what 
was their cute, pithy, succinct little saying? Stay the course. We 
can't pull out. We can't cut and run.

Who is scrambling to make sure they can protect their own political 
hides now and be supportive of making sure that we can withdraw, but in 
a responsible fashion? Well, it is they that spend plenty of time 
talking about that. We are the ones that are bringing about the 
beginning of the end of this war by putting those votes up on that 
board and bringing those bills to this floor that they refused to yield 
on.
