Mr. ROSS. I appreciate the gentleman joining me and his commitment to 
our brave men and women in uniform. I thank the President for going to 
Iraq. He was there, I think it was his third trip, he was there for a 
few hours. I spent a day in Iraq. You have been several times. I think 
it is important that we go and we let our soldiers know we support them 
and make sure some of this money over there is being spent on them and 
providing them the best equipment that money can buy. They deserve 
nothing less.

But the type of folks that I think the President needs to spend a lot 
more time listening to are the type of Members of Congress that have 
served in the military, like Patrick Murphy from Pennsylvania. Patrick, 
not too long ago, was known as Captain Murphy and spent not a few hours 
in Iraq, but a few months in Iraq, nearly a year. Patrick Murphy from 
Pennsylvania's Eighth Congressional District, a fellow Blue Dog member 
who helped write H.R. 97, which is a bill endorsed by the Blue Dog 
Coalition to provide for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability to 
ensure that this $16 million an hour of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, 
which is going to Iraq, is being spent on our soldiers.

With that, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Congressman-
Captain Patrick Murphy.
