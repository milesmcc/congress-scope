Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Congress adjourned for 
Memorial Day having failed to pass an emergency troop funding bill that 
our military says is vital to successful operations in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, including pay for our brave men and women in uniform.

Because the majority refuses to bring a clean bill to the floor, the 
military has announced that they will shift funding from one priority 
to another in order to meet the needs of our troops and civilian 
military employees. It is disappointing that when our military needs 
money to protect American families, the majority refuses to appropriate 
the funding without tying on billions more in unrelated spending.

On behalf of my constituents, many of whom serve proudly in the 
military, we need to work together for a clean emergency supplemental 
bill to be brought to the floor immediately for consideration. Our 
Nation is at risk with a delay in military funding, a failure to renew 
FISA, and limits on our energy independence.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
