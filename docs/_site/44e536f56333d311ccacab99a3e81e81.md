Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it seems evident to me that, 
unfortunately, the majority leader is not pursuing the path we 
discussed, or at least that is my interpretation of what he is saying. 
I think that is so unfortunate.

I want to vote to proceed to this bill. I was the first Republican to 
announce my support for the carefully constructed language in the Armed 
Services Committee that would repeal don't ask, don't tell. But that is 
not all that is in this bill. This is an enormously important bill to 
our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. It authorizes a pay raise that is 
important to my home State. It is a vitally important bill.

I just do not understand why we can't proceed along a path that will 
bring us to success and that will allow us to get the 60 votes to 
proceed, which I am willing to be one of those 60 votes. I thought we 
were extremely close to getting a reasonable agreement yesterday that 
would allow us to proceed. I was even willing to consider a proposal by 
the majority leader that we would start the DOD bill and then go to the 
tax bill, finish the tax bill, and then return to finish the DOD bill. 
I think there is such a clear path for us to be able to get this bill 
done, and I am perplexed and frustrated that this important bill is 
going to become a victim of politics. We should be able to do better.

Senator Lieberman and I have been bargaining in good faith with the 
majority leader. He, too, has been creative in his approaches.

So I just want to say that I am perplexed as to what has happened and 
why we are not going forward in a constructive way that would lead to 
success.
