Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly condemn H.Con.Res 63, 
and the destructive message it sends our troops. Additionally, it sends 
a message that emboldens the very terrorists we are fighting to prevent 
another 9/11.

The debate over this resolution makes America appear weak in her 
resolve to win the war on terror. We have seen terrorism all across the 
globe, from bombings in Spain, to London and Bali.

America is fighting radical Islamic jihadists, an enemy that poses a 
threat of colossal proportions. They will stop at nothing to follow 
their twisted version of Islam and to pursue the destruction of Israel 
and Western civilization.

That is why I stand here with the firm resolve and pledge to protect 
my country and future generations from terrorism. I took an oath and 
have a constitutional obligation as a Member of Congress to protect and 
defend America from all enemies, foreign or domestic. This is an 
obligation all Members of Congress share, and it simply escapes me how 
some of my colleagues fail to understand the dire consequences of 
leaving Iraq.
