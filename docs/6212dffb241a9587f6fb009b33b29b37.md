# PERSONAL EXPLANATION

Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to explain again 
why I think it is impractical to put this dividing line between this 
funding.

If there has to be a strike, if there has to be preemption because 
IED material is moving across the border that could injure our 
soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our marines, probably the reactive 
force is going to be led by one of the combatant commanders who is in 
the Iraqi theater and who is being funded by money under OEF or OIF. It 
is probably not going to come. And the idea you can't have uniformed 
personnel expending his time and his staff's time planning what it is 
going to take to defend his soldiers, sailors, airmen or marines from 
interference from the Iranian side of the border, is, in my estimation, 
not practical.

Those are the forces that are going to be responding, and I think we 
have to let them put together that contingency plan.
