Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I'm very proud that the 
actions on the House floor today reflect the attitude of a caring 
Nation, and so I'm very proud that we have had the opportunity now to 
pass out of this House for the President's signature an increase in the 
minimum wage; relief for small businesses; a fix for the Walter Reed 
debacle, and the health care for the many families and soldiers, 
soldiers that are returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan; and the 
crisis in the gulf region has been responded to by hopefully providing 
dollars for education and a construction of homes.

As we enter upon this weekend to memorialize the dead, I could not 
continue a disastrous war, and so I proudly stand as a caring American 
to have voted against the continuation of this war. But I say to those 
who are fallen and to their families, we mourn you, we respect you, and 
we admire your service. Together we will continue to press forward so 
that this war, this misdirected mission, will end.

But to our soldiers that we will honor, as we return home to our 
districts, we say to their families, they were victorious, they were 
successful, they were honorable, they are patriots, they are loved by 
America. May I salute you, and God bless the United States of America.
