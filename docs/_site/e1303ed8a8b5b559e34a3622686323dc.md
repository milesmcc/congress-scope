Mr. ROONEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 
206, which commends the soldiers, civilian personnel, and their 
families stationed


at Fort Gordon, Georgia, for their service and dedication to the United 
States.

I want to commend Representative Paul Broun of Georgia for sponsoring 
this legislation which has drawn wide support of other Members as 
cosponsors, including a great number of non-Georgians.

Mr. Speaker, Fort Gordon has been an important site of Army training 
for more than 60 years. Initially a training area for newly formed 
combat divisions preparing for battle in World War II, the 4th 
Infantry, the 26th Infantry, and the 10th Armored Divisions trained at 
the then-Camp Gordon before they were deployed to combat in Europe and 
distinguished themselves in hard fighting across France, the Low 
Countries, and Germany.

After the war, the newly designated Fort Gordon became the home of 
the Army's Signal Corps. In every conflict since, from Korea through 
today's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Fort Gordon has trained Army 
combat communicators in their essential combat duties.

This is why it is, therefore, right and proper that we recognize Fort 
Gordon, the home of the Army Signal Corps, for its outstanding 
contributions to our Nation. I urge all Members to support this 
resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
