`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 18 June 2007`

---


Mr. KUCINICH. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, this is not my 
translation. This is a translation from the New York Times Tehran 
Bureau of this speech, and that is what I wanted to submit in the 
Record, because this debate, even if unintentional, could be used as 
still another cause for a U.S. attack on Iran, and because the 
International Atomic Energy Agency has not established that Iran is 
developing nuclear weapons and because we went to war against Iraq on 
the basis of misinformation, disinformation, and because I stand for 
peaceful resolution of all international disputes in the Middle East, 
in the region, and because I do share the concern that Israel would be 
in peril, which is why I did the research. I did the research. That is 
the basis of my wanting to submit a translation.

Now, there is an old saying ''much is lost in translation,'' and if 
there is so much riding on this resolution, it would appear to me that 
the prudent approach to take would be to read a translation from Farsi 
to English. And I have two such translations to offer this Congress if 
anyone is interested.
