Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, in World War I, the U.S. and Allied victory was 
called Armistice Day. In World War II, it was called VE Day, Victory in 
Europe, and VJ Day, Victory over Japan. Now, this Congress has already 
proclaimed SI Day, Surrender in Iraq Day.

By proclaiming a day to the world that we plan to ''get out of 
Dodge,'' no matter the situation, no matter the consequences, because 
some lack the moral will to win defies commonsense and basic military 
logic. You never tell the enemy that you will retreat, much less give 
them the day, month and year.

I am sure that in the rat holes of Iraq where the cowardly enemy hide 
there is joy and laughter. Congress knows as much about running the 
details of a military operation as FEMA does about disasters.

Let the generals finish America's duty. We have the duty to give them 
the tools, weapons, money and the troops to take care of business.

General Stonewall Jackson allegedly faced the same complaints from 
the Confederate Congress and reportedly responded: ''Send more troops, 
not more questions.''

We cannot retreat and allow Surrender in Iraq Day to become part of 
our history.

And that's just the way it is.
