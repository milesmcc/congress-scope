Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

I rise today in support of House Resolution 812, recognizing the 
significant contributions of the Military Working Dog Program to the 
United States Armed Forces. I would like to thank my colleague from New 
Jersey (Mr. Lance) for bringing this measure before the House.

Military working dogs contribute essential services to our Armed 
Forces through their capacity to detect explosives, illegal narcotics, 
and unwarranted persons beyond the capacity of any human patrol. They 
offer an invaluable ability for tracking missing people as well as 
fleeing suspects. Their support with sentry is crucial for the 
protection of our soldiers and civilians, and they are vital in so many 
different roles. Our military would not be as effective without them.

Military working dogs serve the four branches of the military, the 
Secret Service, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Transportation 
Security Administration. Their service has developed and expanded since 
their implementation in 1942 during World War II and has since played 
important roles overseas in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.



The Military Working Dog Program has increased its role in 
safeguarding our homeland. Since September 11, 2001, our expanded 
homeland and defense efforts would not be as effective if it were not 
for the expanded effort of the Military Working Dog Program. Thousands 
of dogs serve every year both in the United States and around the 
world, and I am glad to be here today in honor of their service.

I reserve the balance of my time.
