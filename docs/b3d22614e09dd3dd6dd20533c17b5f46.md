# FEDERAL RETIREMENT REFORM ACT OF 2009
## `b3d22614e09dd3dd6dd20533c17b5f46`
`Mr. NYE â€” 1 April 2009`

Mr. NYE. Mr. Speaker, the men and women who sign up to serve our 
country in uniform do so knowing they may not return home, and with the 
expectation that, if the unthinkable should happen, their loved ones 
will be cared for.

However, because of the so-called ''widow's tax,'' survivor benefits 
paid for by the VA are subtracted from benefits paid by the Department 
of Defense, meaning that families receive less than they should. For 
families of servicemembers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, this sudden 
loss of income adds an unnecessary burden to the tragedy of losing a 
loved one.

The widow's tax also strikes the families of older veterans. Often 
the spouses of seriously disabled veterans give up their own careers in 
order to act as caregivers. And when these veterans pass away, the 
reduced benefit is not enough for their widows to make ends meet.

With this bill we will take a strong step toward righting this wrong 
by increasing the payments to survivors. This is the least we can do 
for our servicemembers, our veterans and their families, and it's the 
right thing to do as a country.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
