Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, as we know, President Bush wants to send 
another 22,000 young American men and women into harm's way in Iraq in 
the face of overwhelming opposition, even within his own party and his 
own administration. Now we are learning that the military does not have 
all the equipment needed to safely send these troops to Iraq. The 
Washington Post reported last week that the increase in troop levels 
will create major logistical hurdles for the Army and Marine Corps, 
which are short thousands of vehicles, armor kits and other equipment. 
Even the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Force Development said, ''We 
don't have the armor kits and we don't have the trucks,'' and it will 
take months for the Army to obtain the necessary supplies.

This is simply one more piece of evidence that the administration's 
proposal to increase troops in Iraq is terribly misguided. It is 
another example of how the rhetoric of supporting the troops is not 
matched by the reality.
