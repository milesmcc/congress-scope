Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support our 
troops and our Nation. It is really that simple.

We in Congress have an obligation and duty to debate the many 
different issues facing the country. Our words and our actions 
traditionally make their way to our constituents' living rooms and the 
national news, but now, with communications being what they are, to our 
troops in the field through the Internet.

Our words are the guiding principles by which the voters ultimately 
make their decision on who they want representing them here, and this 
week obviously is no exception.

Our words will carry on for many months to come. Our constituents are 
listening, as there is no issue more sobering or more somber than this 
one.

Over the last 4 days, though, I have been struck not so much by the 
rhetoric on display here but the effects this debate will have on the 
morale of our troops. Our words have carried much further than those 
living rooms this past week. This debate will inevitably make its way 
to our troops there in Iraq standing watch in some remote outpost, 
training Iraqi security forces.

This debate will inevitably make its way to the parents of our 
troops, their spouses, their children. These children will remember 
parts of this debate and will grow up learning just how much their 
country supported their parents during these trying times.

The talk also goes to the enemy, who is watching and listening to us 
in the caves, on the battlefield, the terrorist cells wherever they may 
be. They monitor what we are saying to learn of our resolve. So even if 
we just talk, we ought to be very careful what we say. The world is 
watching and listening.

And since we have the power to fund our military, I want to talk 
briefly. We have one Commander in Chief. The President's premise for 
going to war in both Afghanistan and Iraq has always been to go on the 
offensive. It is hard to prove a negative, but it is obvious we have 
not had one terrorist attack in the U.S. since 9/11. That is not all 
because of our decision to go to war in Iraq, but it is one of the 
reasons.

Everybody ought to know by now the basic mindset of the terrorist 
jihadists. They are attracted to volatile parts of the Middle East, 
where broken regimes make it okay to practice hatred and violence. They 
are looking for safe sanctuary that provides secrecy, communications 
capabilities and a basic infrastructure with which to concoct their 
next scheme. They plan and plot and wait to pounce in various hot spots 
around the world, just as they have done in Kenya, Tanzania, the USS 
Cole, Bali, Madrid, London. It is a low-grade world war.

If we finish this job, Iraq might be a place where people are more 
concerned with getting to work and raising a family than one where 
terrorists can plan attacks and sectarian violence is rampant. It won't 
be perfect.

And let's be honest about what is called sectarian violence. Where 
did that come from? A lot of it from terrorist organizations, al Qaeda 
foremost. It is provoked and prodded along because our enemies know it 
will test our resolve. Listen to the tapes of Osama bin Laden and Ayman 
al-Zawahari. They talk about it all the time.

What they want for themselves is for the U.S. to give up. They call 
us a paper tiger, a country that gives up when support wanes or when 
the going gets difficult. In their view, after we give up, they will 
claim victory and turn Iraq into a terrorist factory of training camps, 
weapons making and surveillance operations, all designed for the 
express purpose of waging the next attack in the U.S. or otherwise 
advancing this low-grade world war.

The President knows this, and we need to end this war. He has taken 
the input of others and readjusted our strategy and, as we speak, is 
readjusting our tactics. The Iraqis must take charge of their own 
security.

Our military is pressing for action, action from our own troops to 
quell the violence and action to get the Iraqi security forces trained, 
equipped and ready to act.

I hope to bring the Kentucky troops home, but not until the work is 
done. Oppose the resolution.
