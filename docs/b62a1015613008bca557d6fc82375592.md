Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, in May, we honor Asian Pacific American 
Heritage Month, a celebration of the culture and contributions of 
millions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Their diverse 
talents have contributed to communities all across our Nation.

The Eighth District of Washington has a vibrant Asian Pacific 
community. Nearly 100,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders reside 
in my district, contributing to their individual communities through 
business, education, volunteerism and public service, just to name a 
few. I am also very aware of the bravery and patriotism many in the 
Asian and Pacific Islander community have shown by serving honorably in 
Iraq, Afghanistan, and other dangerous places.

The Asian Pacific American community is growing in my district and 
our Nation at large. I know, as the influence of Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders grow, the American people will more fully 
understand--and respect--the many contributions they have made to our 
communities and our Nation.
