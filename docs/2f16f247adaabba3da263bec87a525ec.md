# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `2f16f247adaabba3da263bec87a525ec`
`Mr. FEENEY â€” 15 February 2007`

---


Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the genuine American 
hero from Texas, Mr. Johnson, for leading us this afternoon.

I supported the use of military force to remove Saddam Hussein's 
regime because it was in America's interests. Afterwards, it should 
have been up to the Iraqi people, and not Americans, to determine their 
fate and how they govern themselves. President Bush has stated: The 
survival of our liberty depends on its expansion throughout the world 
and America must actively construct those institutions. Which, to me, 
seems like a Wilsonian view of America's role in the world.

In 2000, Candidate Bush rejected nation-building. A view held by the 
Founding Fathers who believed the exceptional calling of the American 
people was not to shape the world in our image, but to be a light that 
lightens the world. I prefer Candidate Bush's position.

Having said that, I cannot support Representative Skelton's 
resolution. Nothing better illustrates America's democratic 
institutions than this body having a full and open debate about this 
topic.

I hope the Commander in Chief will recognize the desires and concerns 
of the American people as expressed today through their elected 
Representatives. But America has only one, and not 535 commanders in 
chief. We cannot micromanage the conduct of a war. Representative 
Skelton's resolution sends horribly mixed signals to our troops who 
must solely focus on carrying out their assigned and dangerous mission.

Once a decision has been made and mission assigned, this body should 
support the troops and their one and only Commander in Chief, as 
Representative Johnson's resolution, had it been heard, would have been 
done.

Critics of tactics who resort to a congressional resolution tell our 
servicemen and women and their families, intentionally or not, that 
their mission is futile. When we undermine hope, we undermine resolve, 
and we reduce the likelihood of success.

As Senator Lieberman has stated, a resolution would, in quotes, 
''give the enemy some encouragement, some clear expression that the 
American people are divided.'' Or, as Army Sergeant Daniel Dobson 
expressed, ''There is no honor in retreat, and there is no honor in 
what the Democrats have proposed.''

Instead, the responsible thing for this Democratic-led Congress would 
have been to propose a new way forward, new tactics, new strategies, 
not just in Iraq but in the entire war on terror. Speaker Rayburn, a 
Democratic Speaker, once famously remarked, ''Any jackass can kick down 
a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one.'' There are no 
carpenters at work with this resolution.

God bless our troops. God bless their Commander in Chief. God bless 
America.

Shortly after I entered Congress in 2003, America used military force 
to remove the Saddam Hussein regime. I supported that action because it 
was in America's interest.

The Hussein regime repeatedly defied the terms that ended the 1991 
Gulf War--the transparent and verifiable dismantlement of the 
capability to produce weapons of mass destruction. Previously, that 
regime had used such weapons and wielded the potential of such weapons 
against its enemies. Rather than resorting to openness to demonstrate 
good faith compliance with its promises, the regime relied on Soviet-
style deception and defiance.

In the face of such opaqueness, why are we surprised that the 
intelligence agencies of the United States and its Allies veered to a 
worst-case scenario? After all, the perceived ''missile gap'' that 
fueled the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union 
stemmed from Soviet deception about its actual nuclear weapon 
capabilities. The fault lies with those who deceive and not those 
searching for the truth.

The perceived threat extended beyond the Middle East and raised the 
specter of arming terrorists dedicated to harming the United States and 
the West. To those who scoff at this notion, I remind them about the 
dangers posed by ''loose nukes'' and how the West works everyday to 
counter this threat.

Furthermore, this brutal regime repeatedly attacked its neighbors--
threatening the stability of America's allies and interests in this 
region.

So with some sturdy allies, America took action. The Hussein regime 
was toppled. Others took notice. Libya surrendered its weapons of mass 
destruction capabilities to the U.S. including materials related to its 
nuclear weapons program and ballistic missile capabilities.

Today's U.S. military is the finest in world history.

America can defeat any contemporary enemy by itself. But, we cannot 
win the peace alone. We need help--not just from loyal friends like the 
British, Poles, and Australians. To win a peace, we need less reliable 
allies like France, Germany, and Spain to help. And we need support, or 
at least not hostile opposition, from former adversaries we are trying 
to befriend, like Russia and China. In this case, we have had too 
little help to win the peace.

And instead of focusing on establishing a free and stable Iraq, 
America strayed from the wisdom of its Founding Fathers who warned us 
of the hazards of trying to shape the world in our image. As John 
Quincy Adams noted in his 1821 Fourth of July Speech:

''America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy.'' To 
do so would involve the United States ''beyond the power of 
extrication, in all wars of interest and intrigue, of individual 
avarice, envy, and ambition. . . . She might become the dictatress of 
the world. She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.''

The Founding Fathers believed that the exceptional calling of the 
American people was not to shape the world in our image but to be a 
light to lighten the world. Our exercise and preservation of liberty 
served as an example to other peoples. In today's world, we can see how 
our culture and international trade influence other peoples. But a 
critical difference


exists between being an example and trying to impose a set of beliefs.

The historian Walter McDougall describes this original tradition as 
follows:




 . . . the leaders . . . did not interpret [American] 


 Exceptionalism to mean that U.S. diplomacy ought to be 


 pacifist, rigidly scrupulous, or devoted to the export of 


 domestic ideals. Rather, they saw foreign policy as an 


 instrument for the preservation and expansion of American 


 freedom, and warned that crusades would belie our ideals, 


 violate our true interests, and sully our freedom.


Accordingly, I support using American military might to defend our 
interests as needed including preemptive strikes to those who would do 
us harm.

But we strayed from this tradition by undertaking a mission to hold 
Iraq together, build a nation based on Western liberal democracy, and 
then spread that way of life throughout the Middle East. This 
Administration labels this effort ''transformational democracy.'' But 
it really is what Walter McDougall calls ''Global Meliorism,'' that 
assumes:




 The American model is universally valid, that morality 


 enjoins the United States to help others emulate it, and that 


 the success of the American experiment itself ultimately 


 depends on other nations escaping from dearth and oppression.


Nothing is further from the conservative tradition. Conservatives 
understand that free societies and peoples take centuries to evolve. 
America traces its roots back to the Magna Carta. If you want to 
illustrate the shortcomings of social engineering and the illusive goal 
of remaking foreign societies, take these 792 years of hard earned 
experience and impose it on a nation cobbled together by the British 
after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and on a people who identify 
more with a tribal than a national identity.

Conservatives take a realistic assessment of human nature--including 
as George Will has noted ''the limits of power to subdue an unruly 
world.'' This sobriety contrasts with the idealistic dream of 
engineering the world--a dream with roots in Woodrow Wilson's visions 
for a post-World War I world. As George Clemenceau remarked after 
Wilson's 1917 Peace Without Victory speech:




 Never before has any political assembly heard so fine a 


 sermon on what human beings might be capable of accomplishing 


 if only they weren't human.


President Bush has stated that the survival of our liberty depends on 
its expansion throughout the world and America must actively construct 
those institutions. In 2000, Candidate Bush rejected nation building. I 
prefer Candidate Bush.

It is up to the Iraqi people--and not us--to determine their fate and 
how they govern themselves. That is why in 2003 I proposed that the 
Administration loan and not grant $20 billion for Iraqi infrastructure. 
We weren't rebuilding things we destroyed during the war. Rather, we 
were attempting to build an infrastructure degraded and neglected by 
the Hussein regime. I wanted the Iraqi people from oil proceeds--and 
not Americans--to build, fund, and protect their assets. As T.E. 
Lawrence noted in an earlier era:




 Do not try to do too much with your own hands. Better the 


 Arabs do it tolerably that you do it perfectly: It is their 


 war, and you are to help them, not to win it for them. 


 Actually, also under the very odd conditions of Arabia, your 


 practical work will not be as good, perhaps, as you think it 


 is.


Having said that, I cannot support Representative Skelton's 
resolution. Nothing better illustrates America's democratic 
institutions than for this body to have a full and open debate about 
this war. We are a strong and outspoken people. This Chamber has 
witnessed similar debates at crucial times in our past. I hope the 
Commander in Chief will recognize the desires and concerns of the 
American people as expressed through their elected representatives.

But America has only one and not 535 Commanders in Chief. We cannot 
micromanage the conduct of a war. Representative Skelton's resolution 
cannot bring good. Rather, it sends horribly mixed signals to our 
troops who must solely focus on carrying out their assigned and 
dangerous mission. Once a decision has been made and a mission 
assigned, this body should support the troops and their one Commander 
in Chief as Representative Sam Johnson's resolution would. We should 
deny the enemy encouragement and provide resolve to our servicemen and 
women.


Critics of tactics who resort to a Congressional Resolution tell our 
servicemen and women and their families--intentionally or not--that 
their mission is futile. When we undermine hope, we undermine resolve 
and reduce the likelihood of success. As Senator Lieberman has stated: 
such a resolution would ''give the enemy some encouragement, some clear 
expression that the American people are divided.'' Or as Army Sergeant 
Daniel Dobson expressed:




 Most service members would tell you the same thing: There 


 is no honor in retreat . . . and there is no honor in what 


 the Democrats have proposed. It stings me to the core to 


 think that Americans would rather sell their honor than fight 


 for a cause. Those of us who fight for [peace] know all too 


 well that peace has a very bloody price tag.


Instead, the responsible thing for this Democratic Congress would be 
to propose a new way forward, new tactics, and new strategies--not just 
in Iraq but in the war on terror. Speaker Sam Rayburn famously 
remarked: ''Any jackass can kick a barn down, but it takes a carpenter 
to build one.'' No carpenters are at work with this resolution.

God bless our troops. God bless their Commander in Chief. And God 
bless America.
