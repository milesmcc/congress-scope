`Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. If the gentleman would yield, what 
that means is we're asking the Iraqis to occupy their own nation 
instead of our American soldiers. That, in fact, is what we're asking. 
We're asking the Iraqis to be their own policemen instead of the 
policemen on the beat being the American soldier. I think that should 
be expected by everyone, regardless of politics.
