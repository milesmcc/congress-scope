Mr. LAMBORN. I thank the gentleman from California.

To put things in perspective for my colleague from New York, it's 
true that the war in Iraq has cost $600 billion. That is 7 percent of 
the $8.8 trillion total national debt that we have. So we have to also 
address the remaining 93 percent of the debt, because the war is 7 
percent out of that $8.8 trillion.

So, getting back to this amendment that is before us, I would differ 
with my colleague from New York. We are not cutting any research into 
energy development. We are cutting the bureaucracy expense. We are 
cutting the policy and administration portion of the Bureau of 
Reclamation. We are just keeping it to last year's dollar amount. So 
the bureaucracy, the administration of the Bureau of Reclamation is 
what is being kept to last year's figures. There is no cut going on for 
any research development program whatsoever. So I just wanted to make 
that correction.

Apparently I haven't won over my colleague from New York yet, but I 
would urge everyone else here to adopt this amendment.
