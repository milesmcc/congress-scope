Mr. COHEN. I rise today to honor the sacrifice of Navy Hospital Petty 
Officer Second Class Xin Qi, who died in Helmand Province in 
Afghanistan on the 23rd day of January. Petty Officer Qi was assigned 
to the Operational Health Support Unit in Dallas, Texas, when he 
volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan with the Fourth Light Armored 
Reconnaissance Battalion out of Camp Pendleton. He was there for three 
months in his first tour in Afghanistan when a suicide bomber attacked 
while he was on a foot patrol in Helmand Province.

Simply 25 years of age, Petty Officer Qi is survived by his mother 
and his father. They are residents of my county, Shelby County, and he 
is the third casualty from Shelby County in the last few months and the 
second this year in Operation Enduring Freedom. We've had 13 heroic 
soldiers die in the Middle East since 2002.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that this House take a moment to remember the 
sacrifices of our Armed Forces, including the ultimate sacrifice of 
Petty Officer Xin Qi. I thank the family for their wonderful son and 
the sacrifice he's made for his country.
