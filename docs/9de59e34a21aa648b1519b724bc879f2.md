`Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado â€” 10 August 2010`

Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. United States Marine Corporal Max W. Donahue 
enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2006 from Highlands Ranch, Colorado, 
and had served two previous combat tours in Iraq before deploying to 
Afghanistan.

Corporal Donahue was a military policeman assigned as a working dog 
handler with the First Marine Expeditionary Force Headquarters Group, 
1st Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, California.

Before he was deployed to Afghanistan, Corporal Donahue explained to 
his mother why he wanted to go there. ''There's not a lot of guys who 
can do what I can do, and my buddies need me there,'' recounted his 
mother, Julie Schrock.

On August 4, Corporal Donahue was on a mission in Helmand Province, 
Afghanistan, with his German shepherd, Fenji, when he was gravely 
wounded by


an improvised explosive device and tragically succumbed to his wounds 
on Saturday, August 7, 2010.

Corporal Max W. Donahue was a shining example of United States Marine 
Corps service and sacrifice. As a retired Marine Corps combat veteran, 
my deepest sympathies go out to his family, his fellow Marines, and all 
who knew him.
