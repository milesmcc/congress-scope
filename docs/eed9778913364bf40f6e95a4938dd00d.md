Mr. GUTHRIE. Again I just want to say I agree. When our military men 
and women travel, they're temporary. When they travel, they're away 
from their homes and they move around quite often. And the military has 
done an outstanding job of encouraging people to advance their degrees, 
advance in the ranks; noncommissioned officers as well as commissioned 
officers now require education and degrees. And I think it's very 
important that we do this, as they may be in Afghanistan for a year and 
then back in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, for a year or two, and they're 
picking up different courses. Then when they get home and want to get 
on with their life and get back into the civilian sector, they ought to 
put all that together into a clear path towards a degree.

Again I appreciate the gentleman bringing this forward.

Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
