Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage of a 
brave and dedicated hero of the State of Texas and of our Nation.

Corporal Rhett A. Butler was a United States Army soldier and a true 
American hero who gallantly and selflessly gave his life for his 
country on July 20, 2007 during combat operations north of Baghdad, 
Iraq.

Assigned to the Second Infantry Division, Rhett enlisted during time 
of war, which speaks volumes about his character and patriotism.

Moreover, he was a leader and mentor to younger soldiers and his 
service as a Non-Commissioned Officer in the infantry exemplifies this 
spirit.

Our thoughts and prayers are with CPL Butler's parents and all of his 
family and friends.



Our community and Nation honor corporal Butler's memory and we are 
grateful for his faithful and distinguished service to America.

Corporal Rhett A. Butler will not be forgotten. His memory lives on 
through his family and the legacy of selfless service that he so 
bravely imprinted on our hearts.
