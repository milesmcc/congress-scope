Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Madam Speaker, whether you are for 
or against the war in Iraq, whether you think the administration has 
done a good job or not, none of that, Madam Speaker, is the subject of 
this resolution. The issue that we are here debating now is whether or 
not we support the reinforcements that the Commander in Chief has sent 
to Iraq.

At the request of the commanders on the field, the Commander in Chief 
made the decision to send the requested reinforcements to Iraq. Many of 
them are already there, Madam Speaker. Those fine men and women have 
already been sent to Iraq.

The tragic effect of this resolution is to sabotage the morale of our 
troops and to broadcast to our enemies that Congress does not support 
our soldiers' mission.

Our Nation's troops are the bravest and most dedicated men and women 
on this Earth. They are risking their lives every single day to 
preserve our freedom and to ensure the safety of all Americans. They 
are not letting us down. We cannot let them down.

Again, Madam Speaker, the issue here is not whether you support or 
you oppose the war. It is whether you support our troops.

Every American, Madam Speaker, every American should agree that it is 
in our Nation's best interest to ensure that Iraq does not fall into 
the hands of terrorist groups or of a terrorist state like Iran. The 
consequences of that happening, the consequences of that happening, 
would be catastrophic for the region, for our allies in the area such 
as Israel, Afghanistan, Jordan, Egypt, and others, and for the United 
States of America. We cannot pretend, we cannot pretend, that this ill-
timed resolution expresses anything other than a rejection of our 
troops' mission.

Our troops deserve much better than this. What our troops deserve, 
Madam Speaker, is our unwavering support. I refuse to let them down, 
and that is why I will be voting against this resolution.
