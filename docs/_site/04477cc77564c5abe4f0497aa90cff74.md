Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, listening to the President last night, I 
had a very disturbing sense of deja vu, or actually, maybe, 
appropriately, deja voodoo.

I remember the situation where the President said we had this threat 
to the country, we had to respond in Iraq. He then went on to foist 
hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit spending in the Iraq war, 
without paying one single dime in a fiscally responsible way to do it.

Last night he did exactly the same thing. He attempted to foist 
somewhere between 200, 500, 700 billion dollars of deficit spending on 
the American people. When you do deficit spending, you ultimately put 
the cost on middle-income taxpayers in America.

This President, if he believes this crisis is so bad, needs to come 
to the American people and put the cost on the folks who got us into 
this predicament, the industry that created this crisis, not on middle-
income taxpayers.

This is fiscal irresponsibility. It will not stand.
