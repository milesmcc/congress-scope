`Ms. RICHARDSON â€” 16 December 2009`

Ms. RICHARDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3326, 
the FY2010 Defense Appropriations Act,'' which provides $636.3 billion 
in defense funding. This bill keeps faith with our troops and provides 
the funding needed to ensure they are the best trained, best prepared, 
best equipped, and best cared for fighting force in the history of the 
world. That is the least we can do for those who willingly risk their 
lives to keep us safe.

Madam Speaker, I also support the bill because it makes the needed 
investments to keep our nation strong, safe, and respected in the 
world. One of the most important investments is the $2.5 billion in 
funding provided to build and maintain 10 C-17 Air Force cargo 
aircraft, which is assembled in my district but serves the nation and 
helps protect the peace the world over.

I want to thank Chairman Murtha and Chairman Obey for working with me 
to secure


this funding and also for masterly shepherding this legislation to the 
floor.

Madam Speaker, in my remaining time let me briefly explain why I 
fight so hard for the C-17, as Chairman Murtha can attest: Airlift is 
the enabler of global reach, global power, and global vigilance. This 
is what makes us a superpower.

The C-17 is the best airlift aircraft in the world because of its 
ability to fly long distances and land in remote airfields in rough, 
land-locked regions.

The C-17 is the premier transporter for military, humanitarian and 
peacekeeping missions because it can:

Take off from a 7,600-ft. airfield, carry a payload of 160,000 
pounds, fly 2,400 nautical miles, refuel while in flight and land in 
3,000 ft. or less on a small unpaved or paved airfield in day or night.

In addition to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the C-17 has proved 
its mettle in humanitarian missions to Darfur, Myanmar, China, and 
Georgia in the former Soviet Union.

The men and women who design and build the C-17 represent a critical 
component of our nation's industrial base and a workforce that is 
second to none.

At a time when we are adding to our troop strength in the Army and 
Marine Corps overall, and expanding our deployment to Afghanistan, it 
only makes sense to continue production of the C-17, the only program 
that provides for strategic airlift over the long term.

For California alone, the C-17 program at Long Beach contributes 
almost 14,000 direct jobs and an economic impact of $2 billion.

In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I support this bill because it restores 
and enhances the readiness of our troops, equipment, and defense 
infrastructure. It takes care of our military personnel and their 
families. And it authorizes the needed investments to keep our nation 
strong, safe, and respected in the world.

I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the bill on final 
passage.
