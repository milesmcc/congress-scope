Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, Sergeant Jonathan Schulze was an Iraq war 
veteran who committed suicide after being denied care to address his 
PTSD symptoms. According to the Director of the National Institute of 
Mental Health, today, among veterans of the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, the number of suicides may exceed the number who have been 
killed in combat. This is a broken promise, Mr. Chairman. After asking 
our soldiers to sacrifice so much, we must ensure they get the care 
they deserve.

I was proud to work with Chairman Skelton on the DeLauro-Courtney 
amendment to direct the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration 
project to assess the feasibility and the efficacy of providing face-
to-face postdeployment mental health screening between members of the 
Armed Forces and a mental health provider.



The 2-year project will include a combat stress evaluation conducted 
by a qualified mental health professional 120 to 180 days of the date 
the soldier returns. And a case manager will follow up by phone over 
the course of another 2 years.

We have no excuse for failing the soldiers who have given this Nation 
everything.

I urge adoption of this amendment.
