Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, Corporal Matthew Alexander of Gretna, 
Nebraska, died in Baqubah, Iraq, on May 6, when a improvised explosive 
device detonated near his military vehicle. He was 21 years old.

Matthew and his wife, Kara, wed on Valentine's Day of this year. Upon 
his death, Kara said, ''Matthew made it his life's work to take care of 
those he loved. His heart was made of gold. Matt truly was our angel on 
Earth,'' she said.

Corporal Alexander was the son of Melvin and Monica Alexander of, 
Gretna, and the brother of Marshall.

As a young teen, he made clear his intent to serve others in the 
United States military. At his funeral, in a tremendous outpouring of 
support from the community, friends and neighbors gave testimony to his 
kindness and compassion, his dedication to the least among us.

His life and his death are marked by noble virtue. America is forever 
indebted to corporal Matthew Alexander.
