Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise with great pride to welcome home 
the Iowa Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry. The 
Ironman Battalion returns to Iowa today after a 22-month deployment in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

While serving in al-Anbar province, the Ironman Battalion provided 
transportation security for more than one-third of the fuel used by 
coalition forces in Iraq.

It is with a heavy heart that I note that the 133rd Infantry lost two 
soldiers. I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to their families 
and loved ones.

Now that the 133rd has returned home, we must honor their service by 
providing for their health care and productive futures. Our commitment 
to these citizens must extend throughout their lives.

On behalf of the Second District of Iowa, I thank the soldiers of the 
133rd Infantry for their service. It is with great pride and gratitude 
that we welcome them home today.
