`Mr. NELSON of Florida â€” 13 July 2007`

---


Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I come to this discussion of 
the Iraq issue from a position of having been in the political arena 
for 35 years. My brand of politics is moderation. My representation is 
generally recognized as being in the mainstream. That is clearly where 
my State of Florida and the majority of its politics is, in the 
mainstream of American politics.

Since so many people like to categorize us in little boxes of where 
our politics is, I am generally categorized in that box as a moderate 
Democrat. I am here today to state why I will vote for the Levin-Reed 
amendment with regard to the troops in Iraq.

How did I come to this conclusion? Remembering an Alfred Lloyd 
Tennyson poem, ''Ulysses,'' he says, ''I am a part of all that I have 
met.'' Certainly, my frame of reference was shaped in large part upon 
graduation from college, being commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. 
Army Reserve and being on active duty, first going on active duty as a 
1st lieutenant and then, within a year--since that was the Vietnam era 
with rapid promotions--serving the second of my 2 years of active duty 
as a captain in the U.S. Army.

Vietnam was a tough experience for our country. As I went on active 
duty, President Johnson had announced he was not going to run for 
reelection, in large part, the Nation was split asunder over the issue 
of support of the war. Then during my 2 years of active duty, it was 
the beginning of the Nixon administration, and as they tried to grapple 
with the war, they concluded some 4 years later that we had to start 
withdrawing.

It was a time that certainly is different from now because there is 
such a respect for our troops now. That was not necessarily the case 
back then when I was in the military. Certainly, all the interaction I 
had as a military officer was the best, but that was not the case for a 
lot of returning soldiers. Indeed, they came home to an America that 
did not support them and did not stand up for them. We learned a lot of 
very painful lessons out of that Vietnam experience.

Most of us in this Senate who have the fresh memories of that time, 
when we go to the Mall to the Vietnam Memorial, there is emotion that 
is evoked--often the emotion of choking up, as you see those almost 
60,000 names and you see those dramatic statues of both the men and the 
women who served in Vietnam.

One of the awful lessons of Vietnam is that you cannot conduct a war 
unless you have the support of the American people. Tragically, that is 
the situation we are getting to today. Today it is a lot different than 
Vietnam because there is outright unabashed patriotic support for our 
troops and the extraordinary job they are doing. But it is very clear, 
if you listen to the street, if you talk to your people back home, you 
realize the American people are not satisfied with the conduct of this 
war, they are not satisfied with the progress of this war, and the 
American people, in increasingly larger numbers, are not supporting 
this war.

How did I come to this conclusion to support the Levin-Reed 
amendment? Well, back in 2003, when we voted on the authorization for 
this war, I voted for it, as did most of the Senators here. The 
information we were given at the time was clearly information that we 
believed--that was that there were weapons of mass destruction, there 
were certainly chemical and biological weapons, and we were led to 
believe Saddam Hussein also had a very active nuclear program.

I am not talking about whispers behind the door or surreptitious 
notes that were passed in the night. I am talking about meeting after 
meeting--right up there in S. 407, the secure room in the U.S. 
Capitol--sometimes when 75 Senators were present, being briefed by the 
highest levels of the Government: The Secretary of Defense, the 
National Security Adviser, the head and deputy head of the CIA, the 
head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Over and over these were the 
impressions; indeed, the specific information that we received.

Yes, I got a copy of the National Intelligence Estimate, and it was 
in a meeting called by our chairman, Joe Biden, who had a classified 
meeting to discuss it with representatives of the intelligence 
community. Indeed, the Director of the CIA, George Tenet, at a later 
meeting, confirmed what others had already briefed, that there was a 
program that Saddam Hussein likely had to take unmanned aerial 
vehicles, put biological and chemical weapons on them, put them on 
ships off the east coast of the United States, and launch them over 
east coast cities of the United States.

Did I conclude there was an imminent threat to the interests of the 
United States by virtue of the information I was given? You bet I did.

George Tenet even confirmed that after the war started, the report's 
veracity.

What was worse--and what I was not told--was a major part of the 
intelligence community, the Air Force intelligence, disputed the 
unmanned aerial vehicles report. In fact, Air Force intelligence knew 
more about unmanned aerial vehicles than anybody else, and they said 
they were likely for reconnaissance purposes, not for offensive 
purposes.

So knowing today what I know--that none of that was true--would I 
have voted the same way? Of course I wouldn't. But I voted in 2002 for 
the war authorization on the basis of what I was told and which I 
believed.

In 2006, the agitation against the war continued to swell and the 
question came up about withdrawal. Again, I supported the 
administration, and I voted against a withdrawal timeline because I 
felt if we had a chance of success, we should not be micro-managing the 
military, and we should let them make their decisions.

But then things started to change. At the end of the year came a big 
change the report of the Iraq Study Commission. Jim Baker and Lee 
Hamilton, two of the most respected Americans, co-chaired this. Listen 
to names of the members of this commission who were unanimous. Larry 
Eagleburger, former Secretary of State. He replaced, by the way, Robert 
Gates, when Gates had to resign because the President was making him 
the Secretary of Defense. Gates was in on a lot of this Commission 
testimony.

Listen to the rest of them. Vernon Jordan; Ed Meese, former Attorney 
General; Sandra Day O'Connor, everybody knows who she is; Leon Panetta, 
former Chief of Staff to the President; Bill Perry, former Secretary of 
Defense; Chuck Robb, a former colleague here; Alan Simpson, another 
former colleague here.

These are the people who made up this Iraq Study Commission, and they 
came out unanimously. There were five


Democrats and five Republicans. It was co-chaired by Jim Baker, the 
former Secretary of State, and Lee Hamilton, the former chairman of the 
House Committee on International Relations. They said there has to be a 
different way and it had to be a goal of withdrawal next spring.

So when this issue came up again in the spring of 2007, I voted for 
the report's goal--an amendment sponsored by Senator Levin and Senator 
Reed--the goal of the start of a withdrawal--a partial, gradual 
withdrawal--not a complete withdrawal, a gradual withdrawal. The goal 
was April of 2008. Now the amendment has been changed, to mandate a 
gradual withdrawal being completed by April of next year, 2008.

That doesn't mean a complete withdrawal. This amendment says is they 
are going to leave a good portion of the troops in Iraq to do a number 
of things. What are those things?

First, I wish to say that, except for the requirement of a 
withdrawal, the Levin-Reed amendment is very similar to the Iraq Study 
Commission report. Senator Salazar and a host of bipartisan Senators, 
including this Senator, are cosponsors of Senator Salazar's amendment. 
The Salazar amendment gives us almost word for word the Iraq Study 
Commission Report. What is before us today is something similar, but 
instead of the goal of withdrawal by next April, it is a requirement.

The Levin-Reed amendment would require the President to implement a 
comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy that 
includes sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors. It would ensure 
that our troops who remain in Iraq will perform the most vital 
missions--that of protecting the United States and coalition personnel, 
training and equipping the Iraqi Army, and continuing to fight the 
terrorist groups, particularly al-Qaida--and it requires the President 
to appoint an international mediator with the authority to engage 
Iraq's various factions in an inclusive political process.

The Iraq Study Commission report says: Get going. Do an aggressive 
diplomatic effort in the region. All five Republicans and five 
Democrats on the commission said: You ought to open up to Syria, and 
you ought to open up to Iran, under the theory that, indeed, we ought 
to be talking to our enemies.

When I took off for the Middle East, about nine countries within a 2-
week period before last Christmas, one of my stops was to return to 
Syria for a third visit with the President of Syria, Assad. The White 
House said don't go. The State Department came and visited me and said 
don't go.

I said the cat is out of the bag. The bipartisan Iraq Study 
Commission says we have to open up and talk to enemies. That is the 
commonsense thing to do.

I was attacked by Tony Snow in his White House daily briefing. Guess 
what happened? Thereafter, Secretary Rice was meeting with the Syrian 
Foreign Minister, the same one with whom I met, along with President 
Assad.

It is all a part of the necessity of us engaging diplomatically in 
the region at the same time we are trying to figure out what to do with 
our military.

Earlier this year, over many objections, the President then decided 
he needed to send more troops to Iraq in a surge, and he said it was 
intended to bring about greater stability. I opposed the surge. I 
pointed out, from my experience and understanding of Iraq, the surge 
would put additional American soldiers and marines in the middle of the 
sectarian violence crossfire of a civil war.

The sectarian violence has only been going on for 1,327 years, ever 
since the battle of Karbala in 680 A.D. After that battle, you had, in 
effect, the Shiites separating from the Sunnis, and that has led to 
antipathy that it is hard for us in America to understand. Yet it 
continues.

I said at the time there was a surge that I would support, and that 
was in Anbar Province, which is mainly Sunni and where the real enemy 
is al-Qaida. I believed that marines are having some success.

I understand I have 1 minute left. Mr. President, I ask for an 
additional 5 minutes.
