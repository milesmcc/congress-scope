Mr. REYES. Reclaiming my time. I thank the gentleman for his efforts 
in support of our military forces. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and 
marines have no better friend in Congress than Ike Skelton; and on 
behalf of the Fifth Brigade of the First Armored Division at Fort 
Bliss, I want to thank the chairman for his assurance that their work 
in support of FCS and Army modernization, as they prepare for the test 
event next summer, will not be affected by the bill that we are 
debating today.

FCS represents the cornerstone of the Army's modernization plans, and 
I appreciate the chairman's understanding of the need to continue 
investing in the Army's future even as we face the challenges of 
today's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
