Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, time is running out to send our troops 
the funds and resources they need to continue their critical mission in 
Iraq. It is time to pass a porkless supplemental bill aimed at victory 
rather than defeat.

The National Intelligence Estimate released in January warned of the 
perils of an early troop withdrawal stating, ''If coalition forces were 
withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this 
almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and 
scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq.''

Many on the other side of the aisle urge Congress to heed the other 
warnings in this document, yet they willfully ignore this particular 
warning. They prefer a strategy that would tie the hands of our 
military commanders on the ground, removing our troops and continuing a 
defeatist policy of cut and run.

It is obvious to me that Washington Democrats would exploit our 
troops to make a political statement rather than work in a bipartisan 
fashion to provide our brave men and women in uniform the funding they 
need.

Madam Speaker, it is time we vote a clean supplemental to give our 
troops the support they must have.
