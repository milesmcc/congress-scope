`Mr. MENENDEZ â€” 10 April 2007`

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Iowa 
yielding time, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue.

Mr. President we are back again--almost a year after Congress passed 
breakthrough legislation--discussing embryonic stem cell research and, 
again, I rise in strong support of this lifesaving, life-enhancing 
legislation.

I am a proud cosponsor of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement 
Act, because I believe the bill has the potential to make a profound 
and positive impact on the health of millions of Americans. I believe 
that it can do so in an ethical manner.

We know embryonic stem cells have the unique ability to develop into 
virtually every cell and tissue in the body. We know numerous frozen 
embryos in fertility clinics remain unused by couples at the completion 
of their fertility treatments. Why should they not be allowed to donate 
those embryos to Federal research to save lives? We allow people to 
donate organs to save lives. Why couldn't a couple, if they so choose, 
donate their frozen embryos instead of simply discarding them, throwing 
them away, throwing away hope?

We can do this ethically and still cure illnesses, enhance lives and, 
hopefully, even save lives. But the truth is, we should not even be 
having this debate right now because if the President had done his duty 
last year and not vetoed H.R. 810, this bill would already be law, and 
this country's dedicated medical researchers would be well on their way 
to discovering treatments and cures for many of the most savage 
diseases afflicting us. But when given the opportunity to carry out the 
will of the people, he stood for ideology and ignorance over science 
and research.

Mr. President, enough is enough. It is time for a change. I have no 
doubt that the Senate will pass this important legislation and thus 
seek to advance federally funded research on embryonic stem cells. I 
have no doubt that if it becomes law, the bill would save and improve 
lives all over America. I have no doubt that the majority of Americans 
want us to pass this bill into law. My only doubt is whether our 
President will do his duty and sign it into law.

During the last Congress, President Bush vetoed H.R. 810, crushing 
the hopes of millions of Americans. This year, I fear and suspect that 
he will follow the same misguided path. But before he takes us down 
that route, one that leads to more heartbreak and suffering, I have one 
question. Why? Why is he standing in the way of research that will save 
lives? Why is he keeping our parents, our children, and our friends 
locked in wheelchairs and hospital beds? Why is he letting conservative 
ideology rob the lives of so many suffering Americans?

The simple fact is, whatever the claims of those who ignore science 
in favor of ideology, embryonic stem cell research offers one of the 
most promising leaps forward in the history of medicine. Speak to those 
who are eager to do the research and you hear of potential cures for 
juvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord 
injuries. If we unlock the door to this research, we can find 
treatments and cures for these debilitating and painful diseases. We 
owe it to our parents, our children, and our grandchildren to unlock 
that door.

But President Bush prefers ignorance and pain over mercy and 
miracles. Where is the compassion he often speaks of? His own 
scientists are trying to explain the power of this research, but he 
continues to turn a deaf ear, refusing to listen to common sense and 
reason. Mr. President, it is time to start listening.

The preamble of our Constitution says all Americans have the right to 
''life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' I believe this implies 
the freedom to be physically able. By not allowing embryonic stem cell 
research, we are prohibiting individuals from pursuing their rights. We 
are blocking them from a possible cure or treatment. And we are 
standing in the way of their freedom.

Last Congress, the interim chair of the National Institutes of Health 
stem cell task force, bravely and bluntly spoke of the importance of 
embryonic stem cell research and the drawbacks of the current policy 
prohibiting research.

He said:




 Science works best when scientists can pursue all avenues 


 of research. If the cure for Parkinson's disease or juvenile 


 diabetes lay behind one of four doors, wouldn't you want the 


 option to open all four doors at once instead of one door?


How can we tell our loved ones that their cure could be waiting 
behind a laboratory door, but that door is locked? We must pursue all 
avenues of research and unlock the potential that embryonic stem cell 
research holds.

But if that isn't enough, recently, before the Health Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee, the Director of the NIH, Elias Zerhouni, 
said the great promise of human embryonic stem cell research is being 
impeded by President Bush's policy. He said:




 It is in the best interest of our scientists, our science, 


 and our country that we find ways and the nation finds a way 


 to go full speed across adult and embryonic stem cells 


 equally.


So if President Bush won't listen to his own scientists, who will he 
listen to? Perhaps he will listen to the American people who are crying 
out in virtual unison for change. More than 70 percent of Americans 
support embryonic stem cell research. Three out of four Americans 
understand the hope and promise this research provides.

This bill means all the prayers for cures and therapies for 
Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy, heart disease, and other 
illnesses could be answered. This bill provides a promise that families 
might no longer have to see a loved one suffering. This bill means hope 
for individuals challenged and fighting to live a life with dignity. I 
have met with children and families all over New Jersey who have shared 
their daily struggle with diseases and conditions that could be cured 
or treated if we were to pursue embryonic stem cell research.

Young children have come to my office and told me how they have to 
prick themselves with a needle, administer insulin shots, or use an 
internal pump on the side of their body in order to keep their juvenile 
diabetes under control. These children might be freed of this grave 
responsibility if we support embryonic stem cell research. Don't we owe 
them the opportunity of a better life? Don't we owe it to the husband 
whose wife shakes uncontrollably from Parkinson's disease to help find 
a cure that will restore her body? Don't we owe it to the athletes who 
told me about their life-altering spinal cord injuries, to give them 
the freedom to walk again?



None of these individuals chose their current situations. But we can 
choose to help get them out of those situations. We owe it to the 
American people, to the millions of Americans and their families 
suffering from life-altering disabilities and diseases, to demonstrate 
our Nation's full commitment to finding a cure and doing all we can to 
help their dreams and hopes come true. Stem cell research has vast 
potential for curing diseases, alleviating suffering, and saving lives. 
I know my colleagues recognize the enormous potential of this research, 
too. It is time for the President to start listening.

The question is, Why does President Bush continually ignore the 
American people? He ignores what the American people are saying about 
Iraq, and now he ignores what they are saying about embryonic stem cell 
research. Both decisions result in lost lives, and both decisions cause 
pain and suffering. This is unacceptable to me and the overwhelming 
majority of Americans. It should be unacceptable to the President as 
well.

I am very passionate and dedicated to this cause because the promise 
of stem cell research has personally captivated my family, like it has 
so many other American families. My mother suffers from severe 
Alzheimer's disease. When I look at her empty gaze and her shriveled 
body, I cannot help but wonder if we had started embryonic stem cell 
research years ago, would she still be suffering today, would she be 
cured, would she at least be able to recognize her children and her 
grandchildren, would she have been with me on the day I took the oath 
of office in this Chamber.

I don't want my children to be asking the same types of questions. We 
cannot wait any longer.

The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is an ethical life-enhancing, 
lifesaving piece of legislation. I believe it is the moral obligation 
of the United States Government and the President of the United States 
to allow this process--these potential cures--to be fully explored.

Embryonic stem cell research holds the promise of hope and the 
possible restoration of life.

We owe it to current and future generations to ensure that their 
lives remain as bright and prosperous as today's science allows.

It is time for the President to start listening to the American 
people and to the scientists, not just special interests. It is time 
for him to sign this important piece of legislation into law and open 
the door to the hope and promise of embryonic stem cell research.

It is time for hope and cures--not despair and disease.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
