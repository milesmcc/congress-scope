# FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `ba73378d61997ecc71c61a4007637c35`
`Mr. REID â€” 17 December 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, on the immunity issue--we have 
a lot of matters here. We have had 60-vote margins all year, including 
on the war


in Iraq. The Senator is right that there is no requirement that there 
be 60 votes. But there is a requirement that if somebody talks and 
keeps talking, there won't be a vote. So the Senator can offer his 
amendment, but, as we have heard from people on both sides of the 
aisle, there won't be a vote taking place on his amendment--50 votes or 
55 votes or 60 votes.

I thought it would be in the interest of the body to cut to the chase 
and say on this and other matters--this is a very controversial issue. 
We don't have time to have a lot of cloture votes on different 
amendments. So it seems to me that it is in the best interest of 
everybody that that is the agreement. The suggestion made is a good 
one.

Despite agreeing with the Senator from Connecticut as to this issue, 
it doesn't mean he and I are right. Certainly, by the unanimous consent 
request, there is no precedent set in the Senate. It is on a case-by-
case basis.

Mr. President, what is the matter before the Senate?
