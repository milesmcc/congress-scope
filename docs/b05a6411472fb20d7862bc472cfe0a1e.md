`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 20 June 2007`

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. All I mean by that is it makes it even 
more inexcusable that all you had to do was go out and listen a little 
bit to hear the cries from people.

There are these sort of ''are you kidding me'' moments that happen 
out there. They happened in my district, when people are asking, 
listen, do something about energy policy. And the ''do something'' was 
let's just empower the oil companies even more.

People are crying out for change in our policy towards Iraq, and the 
answer was we are going to commit ourselves to even more troops and 
even more money and an even greater failed policy.

People stand there and say, are you kidding me? Did you hear anything 
I said? And for 12 years, the answer increasingly was no. We didn't 
hear anything you said. We didn't try, and in fact our ears were 
attuned to a very different set of people.

So now, this revolution that happened here isn't terribly 
revolutionary. We are finally starting to listen to people again, and 
that means investing in alternative energy, that means setting a new 
course in Iraq, that means making it easier for kids to go to college.

These aren't new ideas. These are ideas that people have been talking 
about in bars and in diners and pancake breakfasts and pasta dinners 
for years.
