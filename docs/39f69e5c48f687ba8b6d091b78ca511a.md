## `39f69e5c48f687ba8b6d091b78ca511a`
`Mr. GINGREY â€” 10 September 2007`

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would have time to stay, I 
would be glad to yield back to him as we go forward, but absolutely 
this Jones report last week, I couldn't believe what I was reading the 
next day after hearing the report and hearing General Jones, retired 
Four-Star General Jones, Marine, former Marine commandant, and Colonel 
Kline, a Marine, knows him well. He was one of 20 members of that 
commission.

Again, this commission was created by the Congress, by the new 
majority, as we passed that emergency supplemental spending bill back 
in February or March, 6 or 8 months ago, to tell us, you know, what's 
the situation with the Iraqi security force, both army and the police, 
and not just, as we pointed out earlier, the national police.

And almost to a person, the members of that panel who spoke, not all 
20 did, but they gave encouraging news. They pointed out the 
shortcomings, of course, of the national police and the Iraqi police 
force that was not perfect. They didn't give us some Pollyanna, 
glossed-over, varnished report. They told the truth. But as Colonel 
Kline points out, I thought it was an encouraging report. Of course, 
you would never have known it, Mr. Speaker, by the headlines the next 
day. So the gentleman may want to comment on that.
