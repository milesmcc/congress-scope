Mr. AKIN. Reclaiming my time, I really appreciate the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Conaway) for coming out and for joining us tonight and for 
adding your perspective and particularly that point, because there is 
an almost ethical point to what you are saying: We are saddling our 
kids and our grandkids with a tremendous debt level.

Again, let's put this into perspective. We are talking about 
somewhere between 100 and 200 aircraft carriers end to end. We've got 
about twelve aircraft carriers. Now, that's what we're talking about. 
This is a lot of money. This is more money than we spent in Afghanistan 
and in Iraq during all of those years of those wars.

I very much appreciate my colleagues for joining me. Thank you, Madam 
Speaker. I yield back.
