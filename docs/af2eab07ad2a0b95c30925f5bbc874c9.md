Mr. GRAVES. Madam Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Wyatt 
Hoffman, a very special young man who has exemplified the finest 
qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Venturing Crew 2633, and by earning the most 
prestigious award of Eagle Scout.

Wyatt has been very active with his troop, participating in many 
scout activities. Over the years Wyatt has been involved in scouting, 
he has earned 28 merit badges and held numerous leadership positions, 
serving as Assistant Senior Patrol Leader and Chaplain's Aide. Wyatt is 
also a Hardway Warrior in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say.

For his Eagle Scout project, Wyatt generated community support for 
soldiers in Operation Iraqi Freedom through providing care letters and 
boxes of morale support items currently in short supply with the US 
Armed Forces.

Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Wyatt 
Hoffman for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for 
his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle 
Scout.
