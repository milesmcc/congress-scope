Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the ability to speak. And I wanted to talk 
about the pending business before the Senate, the bill by Senator 
Feingold, with 30 hours of debate about whether we should have a 
requirement for different agencies to report back to the Congress about 
where al-Qaida exists and how to defeat them and how to deploy our 
forces to defeat them.

I would argue that you do not have to be a military expert to 
understand where al-Qaida exists. They exist in all corners of the 
globe. Their goal is to prey on poverty, to take smart people and 
convert them to their cause. And how do we beat them? Fight them. 
Understand what they are up to so we can hit them before they hit us.

And whatever problems we have with coming together over domestic 
problems and domestic agenda items, it is important that we try to find 
common ground to deal with the problems facing the country 
domestically, but surely we can come together to authorize


an intelligence tool called FISA to make sure we understand where al-
Qaida is, what they are up to, and what their plans are vis-a-vis the 
United States.

And this body, to its credit, the Senate passed a reauthorization of 
FISA that I think is a great balance between intelligence needs, 
tracking an enemy that we are at war with, and making sure that 
American citizens are protected in terms of their constitutional rights 
and civil liberties.

This passed 68 to 27 or 28 and went to the House and here we are 
without a bill. The bill has expired. The FISA legislation that the 
Congress came up with last year is now expired, and there is a hole in 
our intelligence-gathering capabilities. So those of us who wanted to 
find out what the enemy is up to--and I think that is the vast majority 
of this body--those of us who want to have a balance between civil 
liberties and being at war with a vicious enemy, we need to push the 
Congress, particularly our colleagues in the House, to get this FISA 
legislation reauthorized.


Al-Qaida is in Iraq. They were not there before. That is probably 
true. They are there now. And the reason they came to Iraq is to make 
sure we lost. They came to Iraq to make sure this effort of moderation 
among Muslims in a Muslim country fails. It is their worst nightmare 
for a Muslim nation such as Iraq to come together and align themselves 
with the West, coalition forces, adopt democratic principles, allow a 
mother to have a say about the future of her child, and to live under 
the rule of law and not the rule of the gun, and to accept religious 
differences. That is al-Qaida's worst nightmare.

The reason they were not there under Saddam Hussein's regime is he 
was not the problem to them. You know, dictatorships are very 
nonthreatening to al-Qaida. Saudi Arabia has been a problem because 
Saudi Arabia has aligned itself with the West at times and allowed 
American troops to operate out of Saudi Arabia, such as when Saddam 
Hussein attacked its neighbor, Kuwait. So al-Qaida has gone after Saudi 
Arabia.

But they were indifferent to Iraq because Saddam Hussein vowed to 
destroy the State of Israel, it was an oppressive regime, and pretty 
much not their problem. Al-Qaida's biggest fear, again, is tolerance, 
moderation, the rule of law, a role for a woman in society, and the 
ability to worship God in more than one way. That is why they are in 
Iraq.

And to say they were not there before Saddam Hussein and think that 
is a clever answer to our problems and the justification to withdraw 
misses the point and shows a lack of understanding of why they chose to 
go to Iraq.

Why do the Taliban fight in Afghanistan? They would like power back. 
Why are we fighting them? To make sure they do not get power back. So 
if you really want to defeat al-Qaida and come up with a strategy to 
make sure they are diminished and defeated, do not leave Iraq before 
the job is done.

The greatest news of all from the surge is not the stunning political 
progress that has exceeded all of my expectations, it is not the 
economic vitality that is coming back to Iraq, not the reductions in 
casualties, not the reduction in sectarian deaths, the big picture, the 
big story line from the surge in Iraq is that Muslims aligned 
themselves with coalition forces to make sure that al-Qaida would be 
defeated in Iraq.

Sunnis in the Anbar province that were at this time last year very 
much living in fear of al-Qaida decided to take matters into their own 
hands, align themselves with us. And due to additional combat power and 
capability, we were able, along with the Sunni Arabs in Anbar province, 
to deal al-Qaida a devastating blow.

They have left Anbar for the most part. They are diminished in Anbar, 
still not completely defeated. And they are moving north. And we are 
right after them. They are up in the Mosul region. If we are patient 
and we are persistent and we keep the troop levels we need to keep 
them, along with the Iraqi security forces that have grown by 100,000 
since last year, we will crush them. We will capture or kill them in 
large numbers as we have done over the past year.

The answer to the question of this legislation by Senator Feingold: 
What do we do to defeat al-Qaida? We align ourselves with people in the 
region and throughout the world who will help us fight them. We do not 
leave them hanging. We do not withdraw because of the politics of the 
next election. We align ourselves with people who are willing to fight 
al-Qaida over there so we do not have to fight them here. And we do not 
withdraw in a way that would allow al-Qaida to get back off the mat, 
back into the fight. The first thing they would do is go to the 
moderates who have helped us and try to kill them.

So this whole idea of leaving Iraq because we need to fight al-Qaida 
is absurd. We need to fight al-Qaida wherever we find al-Qaida. And 
they are now in Iraq because they know this experiment in democratic 
principles and moderation that is going on in Iraq is a death blow to 
their agenda.

So if you want to defeat them, make sure Iraq succeeds. Their biggest 
nightmare, again, is a tolerant, moderate form of government in the 
Mideast. Iraq could be an ally to this country for years to come. It 
could be a place that denies al-Qaida a safe haven, that rejects 
Iranian expansion. The payoffs of winning in Iraq to our national 
security interests are enormous.

The question as to whether Iraq is part of a global struggle or a 
mere side adventure, I would give you some guidance there from Osama 
bin Laden himself. December 2004:




 I now address my speech to the whole Islamic Nation. Listen 


 and understand. The most important and serious issue today 


 for the world is this Third World War. It is raging in the 


 land of Two Rivers. The world's milestone and pillar is 


 Baghdad, the Capitol of the caliphate.


This is Osama bin Laden telling his would-be followers where to go 
and what to do. The Third World War he talks about raging is raging in 
Iraq. That is why he wants us to fail in Iraq because he would like to 
be able to have a place from which to operate in Iraq to perpetuate his 
agenda.

He understands very clearly if we are successful in Iraq, if the 
Iraqi people themselves are successful, it is dealing al-Qaida a great 
blow. So the good news from the surge is that after having tasted al-
Qaida life in Anbar province, the people of Anbar said: No, thank you. 
They are now taking their fate in their own hands with our help. And 
the idea of withdrawing from Iraq as some way to better fight al-Qaida 
is absurd, naive, and dangerous. The way you beat al-Qaida is align 
yourself with people like we found in Iraq. You help them help 
themselves, and you make sure that when Iraq is said and done in terms 
of battle and a greater struggle that we have won and al-Qaida has 
lost.

To leave prematurely would put this enemy back into the fight. I 
cannot think of anything more heartening to al-Qaida operatives 
throughout the world than to hear that the Congress of the United 
States is going to precipitously withdraw from Iraq, giving them hope 
where they have none now. They know they cannot win in Baghdad, Mosul, 
Fallujah, Basra. They understand that. It is very demoralizing to them 
right now. The only place they are holding out hope is here in 
Washington. Can they do something spectacular to create a headline 
throughout the world that would break the will of the American Congress 
to stand behind the Iraqi people, who are stepping to the plate and 
making not only Iraq safer but the United States safer? I hope the 
answer is no.

I hope we will not let terrorists, murderers, some of the worst 
forces known to mankind in the form of al-Qaida dictate foreign policy 
in the United States because they are willing to murder and kill the 
innocent to break our will.

I hope we are smart enough to reauthorize FISA because this hole in 
our intelligence-gathering capability is incredibly dangerous. 
Everybody acknowledges that we live in a dangerous time. Well, do 
something about it, reauthorize FISA now before we pay a heavy price.

As to those who think we can leave Iraq, and it is going to make 
things better with al-Qaida, I do not think you understand what al-
Qaida is after.

I do hope that the Congress will come together and reauthorize FISA 
in a way to make us safe. I hope we will understand that the outcome in 
Iraq is not yet guaranteed, but we are on the right path. Let's don't 
do anything


here in Washington because of the next election that will haunt this 
country for decades. Let's not put every moderate force at risk in the 
Middle East by pulling the plug in Iraq and undercutting General 
Petraeus. This man and those who serve with him deserve our respect, 
our gratitude and, more than anything else, our support.

I yield the floor.
