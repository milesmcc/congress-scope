`Mr. WU â€” 12 June 2008`

Mr. WU. Again, on behalf of my good friend and colleague, Mr. 
DeFazio, I am presenting this amendment.

When the President announced his new vision for the Nation's space 
exploration program on January 14, 2004, he proposed a new human 
exploration vehicle to return to the Moon by 2020 and to leverage these 
lunar efforts to send a human mission to Mars.

After Mr. Bush unveiled his plan in 2004, a congressional 
subcommittee requested that the Congressional Budget Office perform a 
budgetary analysis of NASA's New Vision For Space Exploration, as this 
program was titled. The report was released in September of 2004 and 
concluded that NASA's long-term projections only included a 2 percent 
increase for inflation.

NASA's budget has undergone radical changes since the President's 
vision was announced in 2004. NASA's budget requests for aeronautics 
has been reduced by over $200 million. NASA's budget requests for 
science programs, including climate research, have been reduced by over 
$300 million. In stark contrast during the same period, overall funding 
requests for NASA have increased by over $2 billion.

Since the President first proposed his new ''vision for space 
exploration,'' we have spent more than $600 billion in Iraq, over $120 
billion on Hurricane Katrina, and the Federal deficit has grown by over 
$2.4 trillion.

Mr. DeFazio's amendment will direct the Congressional Budget Office 
to update its 2004 budgetary analysis of the President's plan. This 
makes fiscal sense. It will give us a more complete picture of the 
budgetary hurdles the project will face and a more accurate assessment 
of its long-term costs.



Congress needs to continue to analyze the project as it moves forward 
and be mindful of its effect on other important NASA programs. If 
anyone claims that they believe that the report will be duplicative of 
previous GAO reports, the fact is that GAO hasn't done a true cost 
estimate of the program, but, rather, done risk assessments of the 
program. Budget and cost estimate analysis is something that the 
Congressional Budget Office usually handles, not the Government 
Accountability Office.

The GAO has done some high level budget analysis, but CBO will be 
able to give a much more detailed report. On Mr. DeFazio's behalf, I 
urge adoption of his amendment, and reserve the balance of my time.
