Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, as we speak, the administration is 
negotiating a strategic framework agreement with Iraq that goes well 
beyond the typical Status of Forces Agreement. Contrary to what my 
colleague, Mr. Hunter says, from California, essentially it does amount 
to a treaty. Read the words of the Declaration of Principles. It will 
need to be ratified by the Iraqi Parliament and therefore it must be 
ratified by the United States Congress as well. This is the issue that 
goes to the heart of our constitutional duties as a Congress and the 
power to declare war, with which we have been entrusted as 
representatives.

After voting against this war, I have supported the goal of 
responsibly redeploying our troops for over 2 years, and after 
President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki signed the Declaration of 
Principles last year. It is a document that outlines unprecedented 
security commitments and assurances to Iraq from the United States. If 
in fact it is just a Status of Forces Agreement as usual, then the 
administration should repudiate this Declaration of Principles and 
start with a genuine Status of Forces Agreement.

I introduced the Iraq Strategic Agreement Act. I compliment my 
colleague, Ms. Lee, and support her amendment.
