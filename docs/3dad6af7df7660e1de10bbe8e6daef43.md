 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to SGT Peyton 
Williams, a constituent of mine from Wetumpka, AL. Sergeant Williams 
was selected as the Marine of the Year for the Second Marine Division. 
Out of the over 20,000 marines who comprise the Second Division, 
Sergeant Williams was selected for his outstanding performance in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF. This prestigious award signifies that 
Sergeant Williams represents the best of what a U.S. Marine should be.

Later this month, Governor Bob Riley will proclaim August 21, 2008, 
as Sergeant Peyton Williams Day in the State of Alabama. I would like 
to express my pride in his accomplishment, and appreciation for his 
service to our Nation in Iraq. Sergeant Williams contributed to the 
success of the counterinsurgency in the Al Anbar province. His work 
there was critical to our success in our current operations and he 
serves as an example to his fellow marines and an inspiration to all 
young Alabamians who will follow him in service as members of the 
military.

According to his company commander, CPT Brian Cillessen, ''Peyton has 
more talent by accident than most Marines learn in a career. He is a 
great American who has served his country well, and I am proud to have 
the honor to serve with him and would welcome the opportunity in the 
future.''

I would like to echo Captain Cillessen's praise of Sergeant Williams, 
it is Marines like him who have ensured the success of the surge 
strategy. I believe that with dedicated marines like Sergeant Williams 
in the force, victory is not only possible in our current operations in 
Iraq, it is certain.

And so, I applaud Sergeant Williams' hard work, and I look forward to 
hearing more great things about this fine son of Alabama.
