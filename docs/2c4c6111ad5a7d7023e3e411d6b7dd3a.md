# TAKING CARE OF OUR NATION'S VETERANS: A MOTHER'S LETTER
## `2c4c6111ad5a7d7023e3e411d6b7dd3a`
`Mr. JONES â€” 11 February 2009`

Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, while our Nation faces many serious issues, 
from the economy to health care, there is one important issue we must 
not forget. That is the issue of American servicemembers who are 
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with mental health challenges.

Earlier this month, I received a letter from the mother of a marine 
who is stationed in my district at Camp Lejeune. This mother is very 
concerned about how the Marine Corps is treating her son. And I would 
like to read from her letter.

''Congressman Jones, my son joined the United States Marine Corps 
while still in high school. I remember him as a little boy looking in 
awe at his grandfather in his Marine Corps uniform and telling me that 
was what he was going to be when he grew up.

''Growing up, he was the son every parent could be proud of. He never 
got into any trouble in school, was always there to help with his 
younger siblings, held a job after school and was extremely active in 
the Boy Scouts. He earned his rank of Eagle Scout at the age of 16 and 
held many positions within the Boy Scouts.

''Because of his Eagle Scout status, he entered the Marine Corps as a 
PFC and quickly rose to the rank of sergeant within his first 3 years 
in the Marines. He was an exemplary marine and an exemplary young man.

''If you review his military record, you can plainly see that he had 
no problems with behavior or performance prior to his deployments to 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

''He has had a very difficult time readjusting to life after 
conflict. He came home to a 'Dear John' letter, had several friends 
injured and killed and has seen more destruction than most of us will 
see in a lifetime. And having no one to turn to for help because of the 
stigma and the fear of losing his career, he started drinking to self-
medicate so that he would be able to sleep.

''Congressman, do you know what it is like to listen to your once-
strong son cry like a baby at 3:30 in the morning three to four times a 
week because he can't handle what he has been through? Wanting to kill 
himself because he doesn't feel he is worthy to live because his 
brothers were shot down?

''Do you know what it is like to be 1,500 miles away and not have the 
ability to help him through this? All the while wondering and asking 
why the Corps he served so proudly and willingly has written him off as 
worthless and weak and offer no help to prevent him from faltering 
further?

''I am so sadly disappointed in the way the Corps has treated my son. 
My son left for the Marine Corps 100 percent intact. He will be leaving 
the Marine Corps with two feet that are fractured, back and knee 
problems, decreased hearing and decreased vision and PTSD that will 
carry a lifetime burden for him.

''And yet, according to the Corps, he has disgraced them by his 
behavior and he is no longer worthy. The way I see it, they used him, 
abused him and now will discard him and find some fresh young man who 
'isn't tainted' and they will mold him and ask him to sacrifice himself 
for their cause. And when he is no longer of use to them, they will 
discard him, as well.

''I hope with all my heart that the Marine Corps will find the moral 
courage to do the right thing when it comes to not only my son, but all 
those other young men and women who need their help and guidance.''

Mr. Speaker, this letter may tell the story of just one marine, but 
this is not an uncommon tale. An April 2008 study by the RAND 
Corporation found that nearly 20 percent of the Iraq and Afghanistan 
veterans who were surveyed have symptoms of PTSD or other major 
depression. The study also found that many servicemembers say they do 
not seek treatment for psychological illness because they feel it will 
harm their careers.

While Congress has implemented some positive reforms in funding 
increases to improve veterans' health care in recent years, more must 
be done to ensure that our veterans are receiving adequate care and 
compensation.

Promises made should be promises kept. And our Nation must never 
forget the servicemembers and veterans who have gone to war for this 
country.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to put into the Record that I have 
been talking with the Marine Corps. They have promised me they will try 
to help this young marine. And I must close, Mr. Speaker, for all those 
serving in Afghanistan and Iraq and all those who were killed and all 
of those wounded both physically and mentally, that God continue to 
bless our servicemen and God continue to bless America.
