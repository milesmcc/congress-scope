Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Larson, thank you so very much. You've brought a 
great deal of passion to this. I know it's in your heart. I know that 
you see this problem in your own district among friends and others who 
are there.

I want to turn back to my colleagues from Ohio and California in a 
moment. I said there were seven pieces of legislation that have passed 
and have been signed into law. I'm going to go through them quickly 
because in their own way each one of these has created economic growth 
and jobs here in California, in Ohio and in other States across the 
Nation.

I mentioned the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We talked 
about the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act; First 
Time Homebuyers. The gentleman from Connecticut talked briefly about 
insurance reform, the way in which the insurance system discriminates 
against women, against people who have preexisting conditions. That 
insurance reform was embodied in the Health Insurance Reform Act that 
passed this floor and not one Republican voted for it. There will be a 
day of reckoning when somebody out there says, My 23-year-old daughter 
can stay on insurance now because the Democrats and President Obama 
passed the Health Insurance Reform Act.

Student aid. We talked about that a moment ago. It is extremely 
important, so that adults can go on to school, can stay there, improve 
their employability, learn new skills; and as the economy is coming 
back, will be able to get a job.

This one I found to be personally very upsetting because my old 
clunker didn't qualify. I actually did not register it in California. 
By the time you passed this, I wasn't here. It wasn't registered and I 
couldn't get rid of my clunker. But 700,000 cars were sold as a direct 
result of the clunker law and it really did help American automobile 
manufacturing. I know that a lot of people say that Toyota got more 
than its share, and it did, but a lot of that share were Corollas that 
were manufactured in Fremont, California; Toyotas to be sure, but 
nonetheless they were manufactured in California.

We talked about the HIRE Act. Incidentally, 95 percent of Republicans 
voted against the Cash for Clunkers law. The Hiring Incentives to 
Restore Employment Act, the HIRE Act, created 300,000 jobs. Created. 
Not some wish list but actually created 300,000 jobs and unleashed 
billions of dollars of infrastructure across the United States--
streets, roads, sanitation facilities. Cut taxes for businesses that 
hire new workers that had been unemployed and cracked down on offshore 
tax havens.

Oh, this one I love. I'm going to come back to this one.

Again, 97 percent of Republicans voted against that program. Three 
hundred thousand jobs. They voted against it. What are you guys doing? 
We need to put people to work.

Finally, one that most of the Republican leadership opposed, 
eventually it did become law and many, many Republicans voted against 
this one, which was the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. Which one 
of us has not been ripped off by some credit card scheme or scam? But 
this really gives those of us that have credit cards--and I've got more 
than I'd like to say in my pocket right now--gives us at least a little 
bit of an equal footing here on that.

So here are seven bills, all of them in one way or another providing 
in this case credit, the opportunity to get reasonable credit; hire 
people; cash for


clunkers, education; health care and other kinds of stimulus. Democrats 
in this side took it upon themselves to shoulder the burden, to pass 
the legislation necessary to put people to work.

My final point before I turn back to my colleagues is that the 
argument that I keep hearing is that it will raise the deficit. Yes. 
But we ought to understand where the deficit really came from, and 
we'll go through that. The deficit was really created as a result of 
three things. Keep in mind that when Clinton left office, this Nation 
was in a surplus. We were running a surplus of over half a trillion 
dollars. George W. Bush came in and did three things that created as he 
left office for the next 10 years, an $11 trillion deficit:

One, he started two wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, and didn't pay for 
them; really the first time in American history. Secondly, he started 
Medicare part D, the drug benefit, I think 700 to $800 billion in 10 
years, not paid for. And thirdly the great recession with the financial 
collapse. Those three things added up, beginning the day that Obama 
took office, he was handed a $1.3 trillion debt, given to him by the 
Bush administration. And if you look at the years out, continuing the 
Bush policy, that would add up to an $11 trillion deficit.

We've got to put people to work. The question that I always ask is, 
do you want tax takers, welfare recipients, who cannot get a job, 
cannot get unemployment insurance, or do you want taxpayers? The 
Democratic House has voted consistently to put people to work so that 
they could become taxpayers.
