`Mr. OBEY â€” 2 May 2007`

Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.

I would simply point out to the gentleman who just spoke that the 
bill before us specifically allows our troops to continue to go after 
al Qaeda in Iraq, even after they are repositioned out of fighting that 
miserable civil war.

I would also simply say, the gentleman asks ''What do you think al 
Qaeda thinks.'' I think al Qaeda wants us to stay in Iraq. It is clear 
from the beginning that they were happy that we went there, that we got 
sucked in there, because we have served as a recruiting poster for al 
Qaeda. That is what al Qaeda thinks.
