Mr. PAUL. I thank you for yielding.

I want to just make a couple of points in closing. The statement at 
the beginning of this war was made that it's different this time. Even 
though the history is well known about Afghanistan--it's ancient 
history, but it's different this time because we're different, and it's 
not going to have the same result. But so far, you know, they haven't 
caught Osama bin Laden, and we don't have a national government, 
really. We don't have really honest elections. We haven't won the 
hearts and minds of the people. There is a lot of dissension, and it is 
a miserable place. It is really a total failure, let alone the cost, 
the cost of life and limb and money. I mean, it is just a total 
failure. The thought that we would pursue this and expand it and send 
more troops just blows my mind.

I just want to mention a couple of things that I think are bad 
arguments. One thing is we are involved there, we have invested too 
much, and, therefore, we have to save face because it would look 
terrible if we had to leave. But it is like in medicine. What if we, in 
medicine, were doing the wrong thing, made the wrong diagnosis? Would 
we keep doing it to prove that we are right or are we going listen to 
the patient and to the results?
