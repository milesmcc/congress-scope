Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the bold and brave 
students defy the imperial regime of President Ahmadinejad of Iran as 
they struggle for freedom.

The people of Iran are being shot, assaulted and arrested by their 
repressive government. This is the same government that supplies arms 
and money to insurgents that are at war with our military in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

The Iranian Revolutionary Guard, a state sponsor of terror, or more 
appropriately called the ''Demons of Democracy'', are killing their own 
people, mostly students, whose only crime is speaking out in public 
against these tough tyrants.

As the Fourth of July nears, the most sacred of all days of liberty, 
how about we invite the sons of freedom and the daughters of democracy 
of Iran for a bit of ''Hot Dog Diplomacy?'' The youth of Iran have 
shown more tenacity and love of freedom than the world has seen in 
years.



There would be no better way to honor the Fourth of July, our 
Founders and our heritage, than to celebrate this glorious day by 
opening our embassies not to the Iranian Government, but to these 
students who desire freedom and liberty.

And that's just the way it is.
