Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Arizona 
for the quality of the debate and, in particular, on such a difficult 
and emotional issue. I thank all the leadership on our side for 
speaking on behalf of our amendment.

I appreciate, in particular, the Senator's last comment. He and I 
share one top priority, and that is the national security of the United 
States of America. We disagree on what role this Iraq situation plays. 
I think it weakens our country; he happens to think it will strengthen 
our country. But our goals are the same.

This amendment is a reflection of my belief and the majority leader's 
belief that the only way to truly respond to those who attacked us on 
9/11 and stop them from continuing activities is to stop the 
hemorrhaging of our country regarding the Iraq intervention.

With that, I yield the remainder of my time.
