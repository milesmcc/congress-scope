Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, President Obama was 
correct when he stated as a candidate for President last year, ''Our 
troops and our NATO allies are performing heroically in Afghanistan, 
but I have argued for years that we lack the resources to finish the 
job . . . And that is why, as President, I will make the fight against 
al Qaeda the top priority that it should be. This is a war we have to 
win.''

Our President has chosen CENTCOM Commander David Petraeus and General 
Stanley McChrystal to implement a strategy in Afghanistan that would 
train Afghani security forces, destroy terrorist elements, prevent the 
Taliban from providing safe haven to terrorists, and promote political 
and civil development in Afghanistan.

Moving forward, we must provide the reinforcements that General 
McChrystal has requested. Indecision will only endanger our soldiers 
and empower our enemies.

I agree with Vice President Dick Cheney: The President is dithering. 
Democrats and Republicans should join, as President Obama said in his 
Democratic acceptance speech, to finish the fight against the 
terrorists.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
