Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker and Members, our strategy in 
Iraq isn't working. It wasn't working 3 years ago, and it won't be 
working another year from now. This isn't about defeat; it is about 
reality.

Our troops have done a fantastic job. But to risk more lives, more 
wounded, and to spend more than the half trillion dollars we have 
already spent far exceeds any gain we can expect.

The best thing to do is to get our troops out, and get them out 
immediately, and to make the Iraqis take control of their country. But, 
today, I will vote for this bill which is a realistic shift in strategy 
that every Member should be able to support.

Our focus should be on protecting our home front, stabilizing 
Afghanistan, and stamping out terrorism across the globe. And we need 
to start looking ahead by developing a containment plan to keep Iraq's 
civil war from spilling over into other countries throughout the 
region. Mr. Speaker, that is the only way to achieve victory.
