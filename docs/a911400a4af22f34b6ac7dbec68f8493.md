Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against H.R. 2638, the 
continuing resolution for fiscal year 2009. Congress needs to provide 
funding to keep the Federal Government operating, and this bill 
includes funding for a number of programs I support. I am particularly 
pleased that this resolution includes money to help Wisconsinites 
recover from the serious flooding the Midwest experienced earlier this 
year. I joined a number of my colleagues in asking appropriators to 
include this disaster relief, which will help Wisconsin families and 
communities still dealing with the aftermath.

But wrapping three separate appropriations bills into one package, 
with no opportunity for amendments, is irresponsible and unacceptable. 
Moreover, this bill provides funding to continue the war in Iraq, when 
we should be bringing that war to a close. And it allows Members of 
Congress to receive a hefty $4700 pay raise, despite the massive 
deficits we are running and the economic pain so many of our 
constituents are feeling.
