Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, today is a day when being in the majority is 
about paying for the very long list of mistakes from the last 
(Republican) Congress that simply refused to pay the bills.

Well, this Congress will not proceed down that road. Before we can 
begin the regular funding process, we have to pay the bills the last 
Congress ran up, then did not pay. That's where we are today. And it is 
a position none of us are happy about.

There is a long list of items that should be in this CR that would 
have benefited the people in my south Texas Congressional district, but 
since the previous Congress could not be bothered to pay the bills, we 
will have to begin again to put these in our appropriations bills this 
year.

Among the many items that will now go unfunded is an improvement to 
help speed up repair of helicopters coming home from and going back to 
Iraq and Afghanistan at the Corpus Christi Army Depot.

The items that this CR is not funding are not the wasteful spending 
that characterized the last several Congresses. The items we are 
cutting here are important national priorities for the health, 
education and well being of our children and the less fortunate among 
us, as well as defense priorities for the Nation.

Just this morning, I chaired my first Readiness Subcommittee 
hearing--a joint hearing with Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee--where 
we heard time and time again about how much more help the depots needed 
to repair the equipment our soldiers in the field need so very much.

Not including the funding for helicopter repair at CCAD is part of 
the price we--as a nation--are paying for the disregard the previous 
Congress showed for the readiness of our troops, and for the 
disposition of the job Congress is elected to do.
