Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today, the House of 
Representatives will vote on a war spending bill that does not call for 
accountability. Unlike the previous Iraq supplemental, the bill we are 
voting on today does not provide the American people with a path to end 
this war. For me, the issue of accountability is imperative. Without a 
real accountability plan in Iraq, there is no telling how long this war 
will continue.

We were elected to bring a new direction in Iraq, and I will continue 
that fight, along with many of my colleagues. As I have made clear time 
and time again with my votes, I fully support our troops and their 
families. But I also believe that it is Congress' duty to support a 
change in the Iraq policy that will meet our national security 
objectives.

When the people of South Florida chose me to be their voice in 
Congress, they put their trust and faith in me to represent their 
values and priorities. Along with the people of South Florida, I will 
continue to stand up and work toward a new policy in Iraq.

For these reasons, I will vote against the Iraq supplemental bill 
today.
