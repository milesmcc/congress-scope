## `8e82403902c6e7809e216c5cc66aaed1`
`Mr. WARNER â€” 8 March 2007`

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the superb 
contribution of the thousands of men and women deployed in Operation 
Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The following e-mail, 
forwarded to my office by family members of a naval officer serving in 
Iraq is indicative of the fighting spirit and considerable sacrifice 
that members of the armed services are making on a daily basis. We owe 
all of these men and women a tremendous debt of gratitude for their 
outstanding service. This officer's perspective is most deserving of 
being considered by the American public.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the e-mail to which I 
referred be printed in the Record.
