Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of my 
constituents, LCpl William Burke Jr.

Lance Corporal Burke recently returned from Haditha, Iraq, where he 
served a 7-month deployment. He was assigned to Company E of the Second 
Battalion, Third Marine Regiment of the United States Marine Corps.

The city of Haditha saw unprecedented improvements when Lance 
Corporal Burke's Company E served. Upon arrival, Haditha was considered 
one of the most dangerous regions in Iraq. By the end of Lance Corporal 
Burke's deployment, the police force was rapidly growing, attacks on 
Iraqi Police and Marine patrols were steadily decreasing, and relations 
with the Iraqi people were improving.

Madam Speaker, please join me in paying tribute to Lance Corporal 
Burke, whose selfless actions benefit all Americans. Our Nation


owes Lance Corporal Burke and his fellow soldiers a great debt of 
gratitude for their service.
