Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, yesterday, General David 
Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker presented their reports to 
Congress. Their testimonies were professional, fact-driven accounts, 
and I am extremely grateful for their service.

During the hearing, I summarized al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri, who has 
outlined his plan for Iraq. The first stage, expel the Americans from 
Iraq. The second stage, establish authority in Iraq. The third stage, 
extend the jihad wave to the secular nations neighboring Iraq. And the 
fourth stage, the clash with Israel and extermination of the people of 
Israel.

Ambassador Crocker acknowledged these goals, but said al Qaeda may 
not follow this timeline. They may try to attack America as soon as 
possible.

The Ambassador also agreed al Qaeda would not be satisfied with 
simply the destruction of the people of Israel.

We should remember what is at stake in Iraq. A failure in Iraq, a 
defeat at the hands of these extremists, would mean a failed state, a 
breeding ground for extremists. It is the scenario we saw in 
Afghanistan prior to 9/11.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
