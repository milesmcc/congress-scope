`Mr. LEAHY â€” 19 November 2009`

---


Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I sit here and listen, I wonder who in 
Heaven's name they are talking about. Judge Hamilton had 8,000 cases. 
Apparently, there is no problem with any of them except for a tiny 
handful of cases, and those have been so distorted by Judge Hamilton's 
opponents that I don't even understand them. Basically, I think they 
are saying what he should have done is gone by his personal beliefs and 
not the law. Of course, then they could say he was an activist judge.

He is in a situation where they will try and get him either way. A 
judge can follow the law, do what they are supposed to do, try 8,000 
cases, get strong support from people from the right to the left, and 
get the highest possible rating a judge can get. But don't worry. We 
are going to take some case or two out of context from their 15 years 
on the bench. We will ignore 8,000 cases. We will call them a gender-
driven ideologue. We will point to a single case, even though in that 
case they carefully applied Supreme Court precedent.

Come on. Let's be fair. Eight thousand cases, the highest rating 
possible, endorsed by everybody who knows him, and strongly backed by 
Senators Lugar and Bayh. Judge Hamilton is not an ideologue. 
Apparently, there is no problem with any of his 8,000 cases except a 
couple that people have taken out of context. We should be the 
conscience of the Nation. We are above that, and we should vote for his 
confirmation.















 Amendment No. 2785


Mr. President, I also want to take a couple of minutes to speak 
against Senator Coburn's amendment to the veterans health bill we will 
be voting on shortly.

Senator Akaka has already explained that we do not need the Coburn 
amendment to fund the programs in this veterans health bill. So do not 
be misled by the suggestion that we need to cut funding for the United 
Nations to care for our veterans. That is a false choice.

This is nothing more than a ploy to take a swipe at the United 
Nations. Senator Coburn spoke earlier, and his statement consisted of a 
laundry list of factual inaccuracies about the United Nations.

Is the United Nations perfect? Far from it. But legitimate criticism 
is one thing. Inventing facts is another. To say that the U.N. 
Development Program provided millions of dollars to North Korea which 
used the funds to ''purchase conventional arms and ballistic 
missiles,'' when there is no proof of that, does not belong in this 
debate..

I would say to those Senators who think the United States should not 
fulfill its treaty obligations to the United Nations, who think we 
should renege on our commitments to support U.N. peacekeeping missions, 
and who favor walking away from our pledges to NATO, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization, and many other 
organizations we were instrumental in creating, then vote for this 
misguided amendment.

But if Senators believe that United States leadership in the world 
means paying our share and being able to use our influence, then I urge 
Senators to oppose it.

Our assessed contributions to the United Nations, which the Coburn 
amendment would cut, support a wide range of activities that advance 
our own national interests. That was as true during the Bush 
Administration, which would have opposed this amendment, as it is 
today. The State Department opposes this amendment.

Here are some examples of what the funds are used for by the U.N. and 
other international organizations that Senator Coburn's amendment would 
cut:

Preparing for and holding elections in Iraq.

Monitoring nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran. Do we really 
want to cut funding for the international nuclear inspectors who Iran 
finally allowed into one of their facilities?

Supporting NATO. I can't imagine any Senator wants to cut our 
contribution to NATO, when we are asking our NATO allies to do more in 
Afghanistan.

Funding 17 U.N. peacekeeping missions, including in Haiti, Liberia, 
Lebanon, Darfur and the Congo. We don't contribute troops for these 
missions other nations like Bangladesh and Morocco do. But they rely on 
us to pay our share of the cost, and it is a lot less expensive than 
sending our own troops.

Supporting the Food and Agriculture Organization's forecasts of 
global food production, identifying areas of drought and famine, to 
provide emergency food assistance.

Coordinating tsunami and earthquake relief in Indonesia and Pakistan.

Supporting the World Health Organization's work to detect outbreaks 
of avian flu and Swine Flu and other infectious diseases and defending 
against a world pandemic.

Creating and maintaining protections for the intellectual property 
rights of American companies.

Coordinating international aviation safety standards.

Coordinating efforts by the global shipping industry and governments 
to prevent and respond to acts of piracy on the high seas.

These are organizations that are advancing our own interests.

President Obama has stated his commitment that the U.S. will pay its 
dues to U.N. peacekeeping and international organizations. The 
Appropriations Committee has acted on that commitment. We are once 
again in good financial standing at the United Nations. This amendment 
would put us back in arrears.

Our dues to the United Nations and other international organizations 
are treaty obligations. Not paying is not an option.



Let's stop acting like the United States doesn't matter. Let's not 
say that because the U.N. isn't perfect, we should cut our dues.

We are the world's leading military and economic power, and there is 
much we can achieve on our own. But we cannot stop genocide in Darfur 
alone any more than we can stop the spread of HIV/AIDS without the 
cooperation of other nations.

We need to lead by example in the United Nations, in NATO, at the 
World Health Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the 
Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization. 
We can't do that without paying what we owe.

This body has already voted for the funds to support United Nations 
peacekeeping and these international organizations. Senator Coburn's 
amendment would cut those funds.

I also want to set the record straight on another misstatement of 
Senator Coburn's. He said his amendment to the fiscal year 2008 State 
and Foreign Operations appropriations bill was unanimously passed and 
then dropped in conference. It was not dropped in conference.

His amendment would have withheld all U.S. contributions to 
international organizations. The House and Senate conferees did not 
support that. What emerged from conference was a 10 percent withholding 
of funds, still tens of millions of dollars, tied to audits, budget 
reports, and oversight. It also withheld 20 percent of the U.S. 
contribution to the U.N. Development Program.

Was it everything Senator Coburn wanted? No. Was it dropped in 
conference? No. The substance of his amendment was included in the 
conference agreement, and for the benefit of anyone who cares to read 
it, it is section 668 of Public Law 110-161.

I agree with Senator Akaka and urge Senators to oppose the Coburn 
amendment.

Mr. President, I strongly join Senators Lugar and Bayh in the support 
of Judge Hamilton.

I yield back any time.
