Mr. DURBIN. May I say to the Senator from Virginia in response that I 
believe--and I think the Levin-Reed amendment addresses this in section 
3--we also should be thinking beyond the parameters of our current 
discussion about military prisons and about other nations in the 
region. I am sure the Senator from Virginia is going to bring that up, 
too, as part of it.

It strikes me at this point in time that other nations in the region 
interested in stability in their own countries and stability overall 
have not accepted or shouldered the responsibility they should. Whether 
it is the Arab League or some other group, they need to step forward 
and say that the territorial integrity of Iraq, the stability of Iraq 
is in the best interests of the region. I don't think they are going to 
do that as long as the U.S. presence is so overwhelming, as long as we 
are the issue. If the issue is Iraq and its future, I think it is more 
likely these countries will step forward, and this Levin-Reed amendment 
makes that point.

What we are talking about is a comprehensive strategy to deal with 
the future of Iraq.
