`Mr. GINGREY â€” 21 March 2007`

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in outrage over reports that 
Speaker Pelosi is threatening to revoke committee assignments and 
earmarks for Democrats who don't support the Iraq supplemental bill on 
the floor this week.

Talk about a culture of corruption. This is the lowest form of 
politics. But, sadly, while their strong-arming is audacious and 
unethical, it is not surprising. We know the Democratic leadership will 
go to extreme measures to garner votes for this bill, not only by tying 
troop funding to arbitrary deadlines for withdrawal, but by peppering 
it with so much pork, you would think our troops needed shrimp and 
avocados to beat the terrorists.

Mr. Speaker, it is little wonder Democratic leaders are scared to let 
Members vote their conscience on this bill. After all, even the Los 
Angeles


Times calls this ''the worst kind of congressional meddling in military 
strategy.''

But arm-twisting and threats have no place in this people's House, 
and Americans have every right to be outraged with the current 
leadership.
