## `d0819f58128a74fdf27ad4a179be75fe`
`Mr. BIDEN â€” 5 February 2007`

Mr. BIDEN. I will continue, Mr. President.

As I said at the outset, this is the first step, this rejection of 
the President's increase of more troops into Iraq into the middle of a 
civil war. But it can set the foundation for everything that follows.

If the President does not listen to the majority of Congress and the 
majority of the American people, we will have to look for other ways to 
turn this surge around.

Even if we succeed in this effort, we still need to turn our overall 
policy around. We need a strategy that can produce a political 
settlement in Iraq. That is the only way to stop the Shiites and the 
Sunnis from killing each other and to allow our troops to leave Iraq at 
an appropriate time without trading a dictator for chaos.

But today my message is simple. The American people want us to debate 
Iraq, the most important issue of our day. They expect it. They demand 
it. And if we attempt to hide behind procedure and delaying tactics, I 
believe the American people will not be very happy. They get it. The 
question is, Do we?

Are you for or against the President escalating this war in Iraq? I 
am against it. I believe the majority of Members on both sides are as 
well. We should vote on that.

I yield the remainder of my time.
