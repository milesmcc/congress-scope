Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, this is really a reflection of 
constitutionality. This refers to any agreement that requires the 
United States to take action on behalf of an ally in the face of an 
attack. This is one that is an agreement that is a security agreement, 
and it requires either a treaty ratified by the United States Senate or 
a provision passed by the entire Congress of the United States.

It's unclear, for instance, that if the Iraqis could repel any 
external invasion or address a serious internal threat without America 
that the United States could avoid being involved against its will in 
such a situation. Quite honestly, it is a requirement that the 
Constitution be followed. A security agreement, by the way, is 
different from a Status of Forces Agreement. I favor the amendment.
