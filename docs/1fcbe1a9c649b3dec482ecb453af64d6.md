Mr. CORNYN. And here we are in the Senate this week debating about 
nonbinding resolutions and avoiding the tough votes on whether we will 
cut off funds to support this mission. Instead, we engage in the 
continued surreal environment of this Senate by saying: OK, now we have 
confirmed General Petraeus, one of the people who is going to execute 
this plan in Iraq. But now, today, we are going to also vote on Admiral 
Fallon, the head of Central Command, General Petraeus's commander, who 
will also be in charge of this mission, and GEN George Casey, who has 
been in charge of coalition forces. Do you know what I predict? We will 
confirm, as we did General Petraeus, Admiral Fallon and General Casey, 
and yet there are some who stand up here in the Senate and elsewhere 
and have the temerity to say: We support you, but we do not support the 
mission we have asked you to execute.

I yield the floor.
