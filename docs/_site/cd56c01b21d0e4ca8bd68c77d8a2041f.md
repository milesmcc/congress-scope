Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, let me, first of all, thank 
my distinguished colleague, the manager of the bill and a distinguished 
member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman Faleomavaega, for the 
very kind words that he has offered; and to the ranking member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her 
supporting words; and chiefly two very important persons who have 
assisted in this legislation, Chairman Lantos for his support and the 
very excellent committee staff that have supported us, along with our 
dear subcommittee Chair, Donald Payne, who is renowned for his 
commitment to Africa, and certainly we appreciate his friendship and 
support of this legislation.

Might I acknowledge the cosponsors who were eager to join to 
recognize this distinguished but bountiful with words and compassion in 
his small package of a man but yet his gigantic heart, mind, and 
spirit, Bishop Mpilo Tutu, who, as you can see, is a man that commands 
thousands for his vision.

We are proud to be able to, nearing the 76th birthday, acknowledge 
his 75th birthday and his 75th year. So might I also express 
appreciation for my staff, Yahannus Tsahani and Nina Besser, for their 
help in this legislation.

Let me say to you, Madam Speaker, that Archbishop Tutu was not lost 
with words or passion. He said, ''I am not interested in picking up 
crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who considers 
himself my master. I want the full menu of rights.'' He is a man of 
immense courage and vision. He has long served as the moral voice of 
the oppressed populations. No one who has ever met, spoken to, or 
worked with Archbishop Tutu is the same afterwards.

He is, of course, linked with Father Mandela, arm in arm as Father 
Mandela maintained his life and his integrity for 29 years. It was 
Bishop Tutu who had a voice, steering the religious and faith community 
away from its closed attitude to open to the Beatitudes, that, in fact, 
''Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.'' Bishop Tutu 
believed in that.

As a tireless advocate for ending discrimination, Desmond Tutu's 
career is truly extraordinary. In 1975 he became the first black 
African Dean of Mary's Cathedral in Johannesburg, South Africa. From 
1976 to 1978, he served as the Secretary-General of the South African 
Council of Churches, once again being the first black African to do so. 
He went on to head South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
from 1996 to 1998, investigating prior apartheid-related crimes.

It would be interesting if we were at that point in Iraq, but we must 
set the picture of what it means to bring together a commission that 
addresses the pain and hurt, brutality and devastation of black 
Africans, South Africans, at the hands of apartheid. It was not easy. 
It would have been better to sit in accusatory fashion, point fingers, 
and never resolve. But it was the calm demeanor, the spirit, the 
religious faith of Bishop Tutu that allowed this process to go forward 
and to allow it to go forward as others have now looked back and said, 
well done, well done.

Archbishop Tutu is perhaps best known for his courageous opposition 
to the internationally condemned apartheid regime that persisted in his 
homeland until democratic elections were finally held in 1994. It was 
for his nonviolent struggle in opposition to apartheid that he was 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 in recognition of his courage, 
heroism, and peaceful methods. The Nobel committee called him a 
''unifying leader-figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of 
apartheid in South Africa.'' The committee went on to state, ''the 
means by which this campaign is conducted is of vital importance for 
the whole of the continent of Africa and for the cause of peace in the 
world.'' In a press release discussing the award, the Nobel committee 
wrote, ''This year's award should be seen as a renewed recognition of 
the courage and heroism shown by black South Africans in their use of 
peaceful methods in the struggle against apartheid.''

How wonderful it would be if the conflicts around the world and in 
the Middle East would follow this straight and narrow path of a 
peaceful opposition.

''This recognition is also directed to all who throughout the world 
use such methods to stand in the vanguard of


the campaign for racial equality as a human right.''

In recognition of his vast intellectual ability, Desmond Tutu has 
received numerous honorary doctorates from several universities, 
including Harvard, Kent, Columbia, Aberdeen, and Howard. Let me also 
indicate as well that he has won the Order of Meritorious Gold Award; 
the Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize; and a number of 
others.

He has also been a survivor of cancer. He is someone who has never 
stopped teaching, working, and understanding.

And for those of us who are products of America's civil rights 
movement, I thought would be appropriate to bring to light and to 
attention the reflection of two giants: Rosa Parks and Archbishop Tutu, 
to bring together the trials and tribulations, the struggles of African 
Americans in the United States with someone who fully understood what 
struggle was all about.

I am delighted to join with my colleagues asking for your full 
support in honoring Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu, a man who stood 
between the schism of two oceans, bringing America and Africa together 
through the idea of unity, peace, generosity, justice, and opportunity 
for all.

Congratulations, Bishop Tutu. I ask my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 34, which honors 
the life and accomplishments of Desmond Mpilo Tutu, South African 
Archbishop of Cape Town and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. I have 
been pleased to work with the Committee on Foreign Affairs on this 
important legislation, and I would like to thank Chairman Lantos for 
his support for this legislation.

Madam Speaker, Archbishop Tutu once stated, ''I am not interested in 
picking up crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who 
considers himself my master. I want the full menu of rights.'' He is a 
man of immense courage and vision, and he has long served as the moral 
voice of oppressed populations. No one who has ever met, spoken to, or 
worked with Archbishop Tutu is the same afterwards.

As a tireless advocate of ending discrimination, Desmond Tutu's 
career is truly extraordinary. In 1975, he became the first black 
African Dean of Mary's Cathedral, in Johannesburg, South Africa. From 
1976-1978, he served as the Secretary-General of the South African 
Council of Churches; once again, being the first black African to do 
so. He went on to head South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission from 1996-1998, investigating prior apartheid related 
crimes.

to the internationally-condemned apartheid regime that persisted in his 
homeland until democratic elections were finally held in 1994. It was

In recognition of his vast intellectual ability, Desmond Tutu has 
received numerous honorary doctorates from several universities 
including Harvard, Kent, Colombia, Aberdeen, and Howard. In addition to 
the Nobel Peace Prize, Archbishop Tutu has received numerous other 
prestigious awards, including the Order of Meritorious Gold Award, 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize, the Archbishop of 
Canterbury's Award for Outstanding Service to the Anglican Communion, 
Prix d'Athene, Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, Maguebela 
Prize for Liberty, as well as the International Gandhi Peace Prize.

Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu will celebrate his 76th birthday on 
October 7, 2007. This legislation recognizes this important date, 
honors his accomplishments, and extols the contributions that he has 
made to South Africa, the United States, and to the international 
community.

I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and 
accomplishments of this truly extraordinary man. I conclude with 
another quote from Archbishop Tutu: ''If you are neutral in situations 
of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant 
has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, 
the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.'' Archbishop Tutu has 
spent his life in defense of the mouse, and his work has proven that, 
with proper pressure and leverage, the elephant can be forced to move.
