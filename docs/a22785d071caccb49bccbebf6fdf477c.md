# THE PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS: D.C. VOTING RIGHTS
## `a22785d071caccb49bccbebf6fdf477c`
`Mr. CLEAVER â€” 12 March 2009`

Mr. CLEAVER. Yes, sir. The people of the District of Columbia work 
hard every day. They pay their taxes, they do the right thing. But when 
time comes to vote, the Government of the United States says, ''Shut 
up, you don't have a right to vote. We just want your tax dollars. We 
want your sons and daughters to go into the sands of Iraq and 
Afghanistan, but we don't want you to vote.''

Now I was elected to Congress because the people of the Fifth 
Congressional District of Missouri, Kansas City, Independence and the 
surrounding areas, needed a representative in Congress. I am that 
representative, but the people of the District of Columbia, in over 200 
years, have never been able to say, ''This is my representative.''

So, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that if the people of the 
United States would like to get something to be angry about, I mean 
there are a lot of things, fluff issues that people get connected with 
that really are not significant, but if you want something that is 
significant then try getting involved in and becoming supportive of the 
effort to make the District of Columbia, the citizens thereof, an 
opportunity to be full Americans, full Americans.

They are not asking for anything special, they want what all other 
Americans have, the right to vote, the right to have their own 
municipal government that does not have to cow down to the Federal 
Government.

As I close, I would just like to say that this is a Nation of people 
who love justice. I mean, of all the nations on the planet, the United 
States is a Nation that says it is a just nation, and yet we will not 
act in any way to support the people of the District. And further, all 
the opinion polls in the United States will reveal that the public, the 
people of the United States are just and they believe that an injustice 
is taking place here.
