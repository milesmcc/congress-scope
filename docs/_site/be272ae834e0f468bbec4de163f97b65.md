Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Department 
of Defense (DOD) Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. This 
legislation achieves a number of very important goals. First and 
foremost, it provides our troops and their families with the support 
they need. This includes a military a pay raise of 3.9 percent, which 
is larger than that requested by the President, a prohibition against 
fee increases for the military health care program known as TRICARE, an 
expansion of available health care services, and improved support for 
military families.

The bill also helps protect our troops by improving military 
readiness, and providing them with the equipment they need to keep them 
safe. The bill authorizes nearly $2 billion for unfunded readiness 
initiatives, and authorizes $800 million to provide the National Guard 
and Reserve, which are terribly stretched thin due to repeated 
deployments to Iraq, equipment they critically need. It also authorizes 
$2.6 billion for additional Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) 
vehicles, $947 million for additional Up-Armored Humvees, and $783 
million for the continued procurement and enhancement of personal body 
armor. This is equipment that will save countless lives in Iraq.

Finally, this legislation includes provisions making important 
changes to the government contracting system and adds increased 
accountability for those who are working for the government in Iraq. 
This bill reforms the DOD acquisition process, provides for a better 
trained acquisition workforce, and cracks down on conflicts of interest 
in defense contracts.

I want to thank my friend and colleague Chairman Skelton for his hard 
work on this legislation. It has always been the bipartisan goal of the 
Congress to ensure that the United States military is the best trained, 
best equipped, and most capable fighting force in the world. This 
legislation accomplishes those goals, and has my strong support.
