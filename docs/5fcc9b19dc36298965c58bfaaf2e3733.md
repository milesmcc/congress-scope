Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure today to introduce a 
bipartisan resolution expressing the strong support of the House of 
Representatives for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, to 
extend invitations for membership to Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia at 
this week's Heads of State and Government summit in Bucharest, Romania. 
Representatives Mark Souder, Eliot Engel, Earl Pomeroy, and Candice 
Miller have joined me in this effort.

Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia have been preparing for NATO 
membership for more than 8 years, and are undergoing a historic process 
of democratic and free market transformation after emerging from 
decades of occupation. They have made important improvements in the 
areas of ethnic diversity, human rights, free market economic 
principles, and the promotion of good neighborly relations.

They can also play important roles in NATO activities in southeastern 
Europe, through their unique geostrategic position. Lasting stability 
and security in southeastern Europe requires the military, economic, 
and political integration of emerging democracies into existing 
European structures.

In addition, Macedonia, Albania, and Croatia have been steadfast 
partners in the war on terror and the war in Iraq, sending troops to 
serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is also important to note that 
Macedonia was the only former Yugoslav republic to win independence 
from Yugoslavia in the 1990s without bloodshed.

Madam Speaker, I proudly support the efforts of Macedonia, Croatia, 
and Albania to join NATO, and urge my colleagues in the House to 
support their efforts as well.
