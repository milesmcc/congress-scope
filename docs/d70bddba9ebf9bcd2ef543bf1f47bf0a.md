`Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA â€” 19 January 2007`

---


Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. I will be happy to check on that with my good 
friend. I represent probably the smallest constituency in the House. 
But is it any different from our friends from Wyoming, if we are 
talking about population as a factor, to give representation? The fact 
is it is not because of the population but because of our status as a 
U.S. territory.

Now I can't say, because many of the Members don't realize we have 
had a 106-year unique political relationship with this great Nation. I 
bet to say that not many of the Members know about that relationship. 
If you want to talk about the contributions we have made, my little 
territory has the highest per capita casualty rate in the whole United 
States. If you want to count the numbers, I have had to go eight times 
to my district to take the remains of our soldiers who were killed in 
that terrible war in Iraq. If you want to make comparisons to the 
70,000 people, yes; but we also say in a very proud way, we are very, 
very proud to make that contribution to our great Nation. So if you 
want to talk numbers, I think we can get into other situations as well.
