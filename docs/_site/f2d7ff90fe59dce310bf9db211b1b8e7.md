Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her help on 
this issue and for her agreement to work towards ensuring that the 
money goes to alleviate the suffering of the Christian community in 
Iraq. This community has lived in this part of the world for over 1,000 
years, and we must do our part to ensure that they live there for 1,000 
more.
