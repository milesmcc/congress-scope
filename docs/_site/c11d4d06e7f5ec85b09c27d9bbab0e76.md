Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I'd like to thank Chairman Skelton for working with 
me on my amendment to prohibit private security contractors from 
performing inherently governmental functions in combat areas, and for 
offering his support.

We've all heard about the violent incidents involving private 
security contractors injuring and killing civilians in Iraq and 
elsewhere. This is a systemic problem that exists because private 
employees are currently being tasked with extremely sensitive jobs like 
gathering intelligence and providing armed security.

And it is a systematic problem that private contractors do not wear 
the badge of the United States, are clearly not part of the chain of 
command, are not subject to the same accountability that those who are 
employed with the badge of the United States, and that those 
contractors have often damaged the credibility of our military and 
harmed our relationship with the Iraqi government.

We want to show the American people and the Iraqis, that there are 
inherently governmental functions that will only be performed by people 
in the U.S. military or our U.S. Government personnel.

I urge support for this entire bill and for this amendment.
