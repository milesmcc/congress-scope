`Mr. BENNET â€” 16 December 2010`

Mr. BENNET. M. President, it is with a heavy heart that I honor the 
life and heroic service of SPC Matthew W. Ramsey. Specialist Ramsey, 
assigned to the 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, KY, 
died on November 29, 2010, of injuries sustained when his unit faced 
small arms fire. Specialist Ramsey was serving in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. He was 20 years 
old.

A native of Quartz Hill, CA, Specialist Ramsey graduated from Quartz 
Hill High School in 2008 and enlisted in the Army. He served two tours 
of duty in Afghanistan, both with decoration. Among many other awards, 
Specialist Ramsey earned the National Defense Service Medal, the Global 
War on Terrorism Medal, and the NATO Medal.

During over 2 years of service, Specialist Ramsey distinguished 
himself through his courage, dedication to duty, and unremitting 
commitment to family. Shortly after enlistment, Specialist Ramsey 
learned from his wife that he was to become a father. He saw the Army 
as a path to attaining a bright future for his new family. His wife, 
Mirella, is expecting a second child in early 2011.

Specialist Ramsey worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the 
most dangerous areas of Afghanistan. He is remembered by those who knew 
him as a consummate professional with an unending commitment to 
excellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated son, husband, and 
father.

Mark Twain once said, ''The fear of death follows from the fear of 
life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' 
Specialist Ramsey's service was in keeping with this sentiment by 
selflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He 
lived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.

At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones 
throughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was 
uncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her 
safety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he 
touched, Specialist Ramsey will forever be remembered as one of our 
country's bravest.

To Wayne and Melissa, Specialist Ramsey's parents, Mirella, his wife, 
Zachary, his son, and his entire family I cannot imagine the sorrow you 
must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss will be 
eased by your pride in Matthew's service and by your knowledge that his 
country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his 
sacrifice.
