Mrs. LOWEY. Ms. Granger and I have worked hard to craft a bill that 
strengthens the civilian diplomatic and development capacity of the 
U.S. Government.

President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton, former Secretary of 
State Rice, Secretary of Defense Gates and many of us in this Chamber 
have said time and time again that the State Department and USAID have 
to start leading U.S. Government efforts to address the global threats 
of the 21st century, including preventing and responding to conflict. 
As our new administration sets priorities, develops strategies and 
creates greater efficiencies and harmony in our foreign policy, this 
requires an expansion of people and resources.

The proposed cuts in this amendment, to USAID's operating expenses 
and the Department of State's operating account, strike at the very 
heart of the bill's efforts to strengthen our civilian capacity. This 
amendment would have a devastating impact on USAID and the Department 
of State's ability to carry out their diplomatic, development, and 
reconstruction mission.

For USAID operating expenses, the amendment would halt support for 
over 200 existing personnel, including in Afghanistan, Pakistan and 
Sudan, putting the U.S. Government missions in those countries in 
jeopardy.

The amendment would stop the construction of secure and safe 
facilities for USAID employees in nearly 30 countries overseas and halt 
the hiring of 350 new Foreign Service officers as planned in the 
development leadership initiative which is intended to rebuild the 
civilian development workforce.

Within the Department of State's operating account, the amendment 
would eliminate $328 million to add 1,000 foreign and civil service 
officers to fill the 12 percent vacancy rate at the 260 diplomatic 
posts worldwide and to fill urgently needed positions here in D.C., 
eliminate $213 million to add nearly 300 diplomatic security positions 
to better protect and secure diplomatic and development personnel, and 
reduce by nearly $700 million funding to regularize diplomatic 
operations in Iraq.

USAID is a global leader on health, and the proposed cuts would 
hamper their ability to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of 
people. The proposed cut in this amendment could result in 18.3 million 
women being without access to voluntary family planning services, which 
could lead to an estimated 5.5 million additional unintended 
pregnancies, 300,000 additional under-5 deaths per year and 15,000 
additional maternal deaths per year, and approximately 800,000 people 
in four high-burden countries going without planned multidrug 
resistance tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment services.

Congress must strengthen civilian agencies to respond to foreign 
policy


crises and not cut core programs in our diplomacy and development 
initiatives, as this amendment seeks to do.

So I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on this amendment.

I reserve the balance of my time.
