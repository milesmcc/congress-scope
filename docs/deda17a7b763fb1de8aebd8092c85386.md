Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, for years, President Bush has 
prioritized the needs of the wealthiest few while taking us deep into 
debt and into an economic recession. In the meantime, most Americans 
have been forgotten. That is, until the Democrats took control of 
Congress last year.

We were the first to recognize that our economy was headed for a 
recession and pushed the President to join us in passing the economic 
stimulus package that provided assistance to middle-income Americans. 
While that was a good start, we know that more needs to be done to help 
those who are not prospering under this Bush economy. That is why we 
extended unemployment insurance for the growing number of Americans 
looking for work and why we tackled the housing foreclosure crisis, so 
that millions of Americans can keep their homes. We also support a 
second economic stimulus plan that invests in America, rather than in 
Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are serious about working in a 
bipartisan fashion to turn this economy around, and the best way to do 
that is to prioritize the needs of hardworking, middle-class Americans.
