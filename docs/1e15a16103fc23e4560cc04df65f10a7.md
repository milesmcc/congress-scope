Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will yield on that point, since the 
Senator was the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, as well, I 
would also share with our colleagues that the Senator presided over a 
hearing in mid-November at which General Abizaid, the central command 
general, testified before our committee that more American troops were 
not needed. He reported he had consulted widely with generals on the 
ground in Iraq, including General Casey, in reaching that conclusion.

I say to our colleagues that I think the record is clear. If you look 
at the findings of your trip from October, the testimony before the 
Committee on Armed Services from General Abizaid in November, what I 
heard in mid-December, I have to say, respectfully, I do not believe 
the President's plan with regard to Baghdad--not Anbar but Baghdad--is 
consistent with what we were told.
