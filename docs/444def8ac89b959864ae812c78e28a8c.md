Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the University of Hate has a new branch campus 
and it is called Columbia University.

Madman, maniac, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is speaking today at Columbia. 
The Iranian President believes in the murder of the Jewish people in 
Israel. He is a hater of Americans. He is sending money, arms, and 
ammunition to Iraq that is used to kill American troops. Not the kind 
of person that deserves a U.S. audience.

But Columbia doesn't care. The University said that they would have 
even invited warmonger Hitler to speak on their campus.

But the university does have some people that they refuse to allow on 
campus. This is the same university that, in 1969 during the Vietnam 
War and peacenik movement, banned the ROTC from campus. And in spite of 
current law and a Supreme Court ruling, still bans the ROTC.

Columbia University clearly shows a pattern of being anti-American by 
promoting forums to warmongers and by preventing the U.S. military ROTC 
program on campus. Maybe the university should just relocate to Tehran. 
And in the meantime, the U.S. taxpayers have no business sending 
American money to the University of Hate.

And that's just the way it is.
