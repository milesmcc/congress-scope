Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentlewoman for her courageous lead on this 
issue.

This $35 billion for Afghanistan is roughly equivalent to the amount 
in the Recovery Act for highways and transit. If instead of Afghanistan 
these funds were invested at home, we could do the equivalent of what 
we did in the Recovery Act, 35,000 lane-miles of highway improved; 
1,262 bridges; 12,000 transit buses and rail passenger cars; 5,000 
transit stations improved; and 1.3 million jobs that we've documented 
on our portion of the Recovery Act.

But this is a conflict with no exit, no end, no offset; and we should 
not provide more money for it.
