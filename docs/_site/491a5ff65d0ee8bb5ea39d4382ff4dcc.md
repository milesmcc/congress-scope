# MAKING EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `491a5ff65d0ee8bb5ea39d4382ff4dcc`
`Mr. DODD â€” 16 November 2007`

---


Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will oppose the motion to proceed to both 
the Senate and House bills to provide bridge funding to Iraq because 
they do not contain firm and enforceable dates to get our troops out of 
Iraq.

Once again, Congress is being asked to pour tens of billions of 
dollars more into an unending war, for uncertain goals, carried forward 
by little more than a mixture of blind faith and inertia.

Once again, the American people are being asked to shut their eyes 
tight against the facts and trudge blindly on--this time at the cost of 
some $50 or $70 billion, depending on which bill we are talking about, 
and who knows how many more lives. And once again, those who question 
this war--a majority of Americans--are being asked: You support the 
troops, don't you?

How could we not? How could we not be awed by the bravery and 
sacrifice of our men and women in Iraq? How could we not be inspired by 
their choice to volunteer in the first place? How could we not be 
impressed by the discipline, competence, intelligence, and 
resourcefulness with which General Petraeus and the soldiers under his 
command have fought in Iraq? They deserve our respect and much more.

But contrary to what the President's supporters would have you 
believe, the


debate does not end there. It begins there. And I have come to the 
floor today to suggest that the President's supporters would do well to 
heed key military virtues: recognizing the difference between tactics 
and strategy--between short term and long term.

All the tactical brilliance in the world will win you nothing if it 
doesn't find its place within a larger plan for victory. And in Iraq, 
that plan is exactly where we found it in the spring of 2003--
nonexistent.

No one in this Chamber would doubt that recent months in Iraq have 
seen significant tactical success. The number of IED explosions has 
dropped significantly.

The total number of enemy attacks, and the number of coalition 
soldiers killed in action, have been in decline--even though 2007 
recently became the deadliest year on record for U.S. troops in Iraq. 
Iraqi civilian casualties have been cut from a high of 3,000 in the 
month of December 2006--even though they still hover around an 
appalling 1,000 per month.

But overall, the security picture in Iraq is, for the time being, 
improved.

The question is: Why? What made that happen? If anything comes out of 
this debate, it should be an honest answer to that question--not so we 
can assign praise and blame but so we can piece together a coherent 
strategy.

I don't doubt that our troops' dedication did its part to reduce the 
violence. But if American agency was the sole factor, why was violence 
in Iraq on the decline before the surge began--even before it was 
announced? It is clear to me that there have been three deeper causes.

First, Moqtada al-Sadr, a prime mover of sectarian violence, has sat 
out the surge, patiently waiting for its inevitable end. As The New 
Yorker recently put it: ''Analysts credit much of the recent drop in 
Iraqi civilian deaths not to the surge but to Sadr's decision, in 
August, to order the Mahdi Army, which is believed to have been 
responsible for much of the Shiite-on-Sunni sectarian killing in and 
around Baghdad, to 'freeze' its activities for six months.'' Sadr and 
his fellow sectarian leaders may be brutal--but they are also 
calculating and self-interested.

They know that the surge, whatever is decided here today, cannot be 
physically sustained indefinitely.

Second, the drop in violence can also be attributed to the so-called 
Sunni awakening: the decision by tribal leaders in Anbar Province to 
turn against al-Qaida and foreign jihadists. That choice was laudable 
and--as shown by Abu Risha, the charismatic tribal leader who allied 
with America and was murdered for it--truly courageous.

But it was also unforeseen by the surge and began independently of 
the surge. But as valuable and necessary as the fight against al-Qaida 
in Iraq has been, it does little to stem the deeper civil war between 
Sunnis and Shiites--the overwhelming source of Iraq's chaos.

The fight against al-Qaida must go on--but there's no reason why it 
compels us to police a civil war.

Third and finally, many analysts have argued that violence has 
bottomed out because Iraq's ethnic cleansing is reaching a conclusion--
because Iraq has, de facto, partitioned itself. With almost a million 
Baghdadis fleeing their homes in the conflict, the city has become ever 
more ethnically homogenous, reducing Sunni-Shiite flashpoints.

Each of these causes has contributed its part to what some are 
intemperately hailing as our long-awaited victory. It would be 
wonderful to believe that America made it happen, after all this time, 
through sheer force of will. Every one of my colleagues, I am sure, 
wants to believe that.

But this is the clear line running through this Chamber: between 
those who want it to be true so desperately that they blind themselves 
and those who understand that that kind of belief--the kind that calls 
a proposition true because we want it to be true--is the kind that saw 
an alliance between Saddam and al-Qaida, the kind that saw an Iraq full 
of WMDs, the kind that saw a mission accomplished 4 years ago.

But still, even if you grant that belief, even if you say that the 
surge, and nothing else, brought down the violence--is that our 
victory?

No. The surge was always a military means to a political end. 
Comptroller General David Walker put it well: ''The primary point of 
the surge was to improve security . . . in order to provide political 
breathing room'' for the Iraqi Government. President Bush has said much 
the same. The surge was always meant to open a window for political 
reconciliation. Nearly 800 Americans sacrificed their lives to keep 
that window open; thousands and thousands of Americans took wounds to 
keep that window open. What has the Iraqi Government done with it?

Failed to meet its own political benchmarks. Failed to enact oil 
legislation. Sustained a mass resignation of Sunni politicians, leaving 
more than half of its Cabinet seats vacant. Enjoyed a month-long 
vacation.

This September, 60 percent of Iraqis--and 93 percent of Sunnis--
thought it was justified to kill American troops.

And during America's long sacrifice to keep civil war at bay, the 
Maliki Government has grown more sectarian than ever, more and more 
openly an arm of the Shiites, more and more actively prejudiced against 
Sunnis. Hundreds of Americans died to give breathing space to Iraqi 
politicians and they act as if Iraq doesn't exist.

Many of the Iraqi forces we have relied on to stabilize that country 
are little more than retooled sectarian gangs. What is stopping them 
from accepting our training, accepting our weapons, and then, as soon 
as the surge dies down, jumping once again down each other's throats?

In the name of unity and reconciliation, our policies have divided 
Iraq deeper and deeper, until, as George Washington University Middle 
East expert Marc Lynch has argued, Iraq becomes ''a warlord state . . . 
with power devolved to local militias, gangs, tribes, and power-
brokers, with a purely nominal central state.''

That is Iraq with the surge in place. But President Bush has conceded 
that it can't continue past July; and soon, we will be confronted by 
Iraq without the surge. So I have a simple question for my colleagues 
this morning:

What then?

And as President Bush tries to find an answer, as he tries to cobble 
together a plan more than 4 years too late, our billions will continue 
to be poured into a desert sinkhole; our Nation will earn the enmity of 
more and more Muslims for our endless occupation; our military will be 
ground into the dirt, unit by unit, machine by machine, soldier by 
soldier; and young Americans will continue to die. And we will be not 
an inch safer.

That is why I have come to the floor this morning: not to pass 
judgment; not to score points; not to assign blame. But because as we 
hurtle on with all tactics and no strategy, the costs are becoming too 
heavy for us to bear.

There is only one realistic strategy, only one honest answer to: What 
then? Redeploy our combat forces from Iraq, starting immediately. 
Refocus the fight on al-Qaida, training those Iraqi forces we can 
trust, and protecting U.S. personnel and infrastructure. Rebuild our 
worn-down, battered military.

Our troops will have my respect for what they have done in Iraq for 
as long as I live. And I join President Bush in his fervent hope that 
their sacrifice would be enough to heal a shattered country. But my 
eyes are open. I know that the best hope for Iraq, and the best hope 
for America, lies in redeployment--not in another $50 or $70 billion 
poured down this hole. I have faith that time will open the eyes of 
every one of my colleagues; I hope they will begin by seeing the deep 
error of these bills.
