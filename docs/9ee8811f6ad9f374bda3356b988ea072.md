May all these brave soldiers, brave marines, brave Navy SEALS and 
sailors, brave airmen--brave all--may they rest in peace. I wish to say 
that if you come to my office in the Hart Building, before you enter, I 
have listed on big charts the names of all the individuals who are 
either from California or assigned in California, and if they passed, 
they are on that listing. We started with one enormous chart, then two, 
three, and four. I am sad to say it is growing.

The reason I wished to mention their names on the floor is because 
sometimes we tend to just look at numbers--and we should--but behind 
those numbers are our children. I am a grandmother. I ache every time I 
sign a letter. Every single one of these brave Americans died doing 
something they wanted to do for their country. Their Commander in Chief 
sent them


into battle, so of course not one of them has died in vain. But I want 
to do all I can--and I say this from my heart--to ensure that when we 
get into a conflict, we know there is a way out and that we can bring 
these conflicts to an end as soon as possible because so many 
sacrifices are being made, and no more so than the loss of America's 
finest.
