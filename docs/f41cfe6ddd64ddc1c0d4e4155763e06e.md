`Mr. UDALL of New Mexico â€” 14 December 2010`

---


Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, in the more than 9 years that 
our military has been fighting in Afghanistan, thousands of brave men 
and women have volunteered their service to our country. They have 
sacrificed time with their families, travelled to foreign lands, and 
put their


lives in jeopardy, all in the defense of the ideals we hold dear.

This month, New Mexico lost one of those brave soldiers. His name was 
James Thode. He was a 45-year-old married father of two who had served 
for 14 years as a police sergeant for the city of Farmington. He was in 
Afghanistan as a member of the Utah National Guard as a sergeant first 
class in the 118th Sapper Company.

Sergeant Thode was killed by a roadside bomb on December 2 when 
insurgents attacked his unit in Afghanistan's Khost province.

Too often, when we are faced with the loss of one of our brave men or 
women in uniform, the first thing that is talked about is how they 
died. A roadside bomb. A firefight with the enemy. Protecting a fellow 
soldier from harm.

That is important. But it is equally important that we remember how 
they lived.

That is what I would like to do today. I want to remember how 
Sergeant James Thode lived.

Those who served with Sergeant Thode saw him as a father figure to 
the younger soldiers. ''The glue that held people together,'' said one.

He was ''a humble person, soft spoken and had a way of connecting 
with everybody he met,'' said another.

A third soldier recalled that Thode had an opportunity for a command 
position with a different unit--but he, quote, ''chose to stay with his 
men, knowing the risk.''

When he deployed to Afghanistan in July, Sergeant Thode left behind 
his wife Carlotta and their two children, 18-year-old daughter Ashley 
and 8-year-old son Tommy. It was his second deployment. His first was 
to Iraq in 2003.

Back at home, Thode had served as a member of the Farmington Police 
Department since 1996 as a field training officer, member of the SWAT 
Team, and eventually a member of the detective unit.

Sergeant Thode was well-known and well-respected within the close-
knit Farmington community. As Farmington Police Chief Kyle Westall said 
upon learning of Thode's death, ''The community lost a truly great man 
who will be missed by many.''

Sergeant Thode lived a life to which we all should aspire--a life of 
service to family, community and country.

To Sergeant Thode's wife, children, parents, sister, and extended 
family and friends, my wife Jill and I offer our deepest sympathies for 
your loss, and our deepest thanks for your loved one's service to our 
country. You are forever in our hearts, and we are forever in your 
debt.
