Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my 
strong support for this amendment.

U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Multi-National Force Commander 
General David Petraeus will provide an assessment of Iraq this fall.

The assessment will include the military, economic and political 
situation in Iraq.

The assessment will be a key determinant for future U.S. involvement.

The debate over what to do in Iraq will continue and the Crocker-
Petraeus assessment will be challenged.

If the report is positive Crocker and Petraeus must provide specific 
signs of progress and lay out in detail how long and how many troops 
will be needed in Iraq.

If the report is negative then Crocker and Petraeus should provide 
definitive steps on a phased withdrawal plan that reduces the number of 
lives lost.

Whatever the outcome of the Crocker-Petraeus assessment we need an 
independent validation of the assessment.

This is why I am supporting Mr. Shays' amendment to reconstitute the 
Iraq Study Group.

This bipartisan group, that provided observations and recommendations 
to the President last December concerning the situation in Iraq would 
be reengaged and provide the American people a bipartisan perspective 
of what we can expect for the future of Iraq.

With all the partisan debate we witness week in and week out in 
Washington, we must reconstitute this nonpartisan group, which has as 
its only goal, moving forward American interests.

Mr. Chairman, it is time we come together and support this amendment 
to provide a bipartisan assessment of the situation in Iraq.
