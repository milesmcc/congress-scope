Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, more than 4 years ago the House of 
Representatives authorized a war in Iraq based on misrepresentations 
that were false, $2 billion a week and climbing. Today, we have an 
opportunity to support our troops and bring them home when the House 
will vote to fully fund the safe and timely withdrawal of U.S. troops 
from Iraq. Last November, the American people gave Congress an 
overwhelming mandate to end the occupation of Iraq.


On this day, Mr. Speaker, we can decide whether we stand with the 
President to continue to support a failed policy with no end, or stand 
with the American people and our generals, who understand there is no 
military solution to this civil war and occupation in Iraq.

H.R. 2237 reflects the goal of the Lee amendment to fully fund the 
safe and timely withdrawal of our troops from Iraq. It is responsible, 
it is practical, it does not cut the funding. But it designates what 
the supplemental can be used for, and that is to fully fund a safe 
withdrawal and redeployment and help the Iraqis stabilize their country 
with a diplomatic, social, and reconstruction effort.

This occupation cannot be won militarily. I urge my colleagues to 
support


the goals of H.R. 2237 and to vote for it, because those of us who 
worked so hard on the Lee amendment prior to today support this and 
want to see a strong vote for it.
