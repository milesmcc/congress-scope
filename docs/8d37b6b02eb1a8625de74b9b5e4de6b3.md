# RESPONSIBILITY TO GOVERN

`Mr. BYRD â€” 4 December 2007`

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as Congress reconvenes this week after our 
observance of the Thanksgiving holiday, we find a brisk wind blowing 
through the streets of the Nation's Capital. As cold temperatures begin 
to grip the country, Americans are turning up the heat in their homes, 
but the elected leaders of our country should seize the opportunity to 
turn down the heat in Washington.

Three days ago, in his weekly radio address, the President placed the 
blame at the feet of Congress for the delays in enacting 11 of the 12 
annual appropriations bills. But finger pointing does nothing--nothing, 
zilch--to solve the impasse, which began with White House threats to 
veto 10 of those funding bills. With 3 short weeks left in this session 
of Congress, it is time to close down the political posturing and 
recognize we have a responsibility to govern.

As the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, it is clear 
to me that Congress is working with great diligence to find a way 
around our budget conundrum. Working hand in hand with Members of the 
minority, we are crafting an appropriations package that I expect will 
garner bipartisan support. This package contemplates a reduction of 
$10.6 billion from the spending levels approved by Congress in this 
year's budget resolution. And $10.6 billion is a lot of money. In 
addition, various controversial matters, some of which have been the 
subject of veto threats, are eliminated.

Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are attempting, in good 
faith, to find a way around the veto threat demagoguery that has been 
emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for months. Now the White House 
needs to put aside politics and recognize it is time to govern in the 
responsible manner that is expected by the American people.

I urge the President--and he is my President, too, and I say it 
respectfully--to stop the stale veto threats that have been the 
albatross around the neck of responsible budgeting for months. The fact 
is the needs of this Nation have changed since the budget was submitted 
way back in February. That should come as no great surprise.

The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, has recognized these needs, and 
events have made them crystal clear.

The crumbling state of our infrastructure was punctuated by a 
deadly--and I mean deadly--bridge collapse in Minnesota. The Senate 
passed a bill containing funds for the bridge replacement and for 
repairing bridges across the Nation by a vote of 88 to 7. That was the 
responsible thing to do.

Soaring oil prices mean a cruel squeeze on low-income heating 
assistance. The Senate approved by a vote of 75 to 19 a bill providing 
increased heating assistance. That was the responsible thing to do.

Investigations into the treatment of soldiers returning from Iraq and 
Afghanistan have underlined greater demands on the VA health care 
system. Legislation to increase funding for our veterans passed the 
Senate by a vote of 92 to 1. That was the moral thing to do.

More money is needed to improve the security of our borders. An 
amendment to provide such funding passed the Senate 89 to 1. That was 
the smart thing to do.

In July, the administration released its latest National intelligence 
report that concluded al-Qaida has regrouped in Pakistan with the 
intention of attacking the United States again. The Senate passed a 
Homeland Security bill to increase funding for first responders by a 
vote of 89 to 4.

Rising crime rates in this country highlight the wisdom of additional 
funding for law enforcement. The Senate passed legislation providing 
such funding for cops on the street by a vote of 75 to 19.

The rising cost of food means that there must be more funding for the


Women, Infants and Children Program or 500,000 people will lose 
important nutritional support.

Yet despite all of these developments since the President submitted 
an inadequate spending proposal in February, the White House continues 
to demand an arbitrary and irresponsible ceiling on spending. The White 
House continues to stubbornly oppose bipartisan initiatives to invest 
money to solve the real problems that face the Nation.

Soon, the first session of this 110th Congress will draw to a close, 
but there is still time to craft an appropriations proposal that makes 
a sincere attempt to meet the President in the middle of the road. I 
thank Senator Thad Cochran and his ranking members for their efforts as 
we move forward in completing the fiscal year 2008 appropriations 
process.

So the choice is clear--as clear as the noonday Sun in a cloudless 
sky. The President and the Congress must recognize that the people of 
this country expect their leaders--that is us, the people downtown at 
the other end of the avenue and those across the Capitol--to actually 
govern and address the real problems facing the country.

Democrats and Republicans in Congress are willing to work to resolve 
differences and complete a fiscally responsible package of 
appropriations bills. But to do the people's business, the Congress 
must be joined by a White House willing, at last, to jettison its 
political posturing, stop its political posturing. The tyranny of the 
veto threat has already dangerously delayed the Nation's priorities for 
far too long.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
