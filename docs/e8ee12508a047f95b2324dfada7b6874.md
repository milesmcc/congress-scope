Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes to respond to my 
colleague, my good friend who just spoke, Mr. Israel.

Let me just make a couple of points. With respect to up-armored 
Humvees, when we entered this administration, the Humvee is a successor 
to the Jeep, it is a tactical vehicle, we had 1,200 up-armored Humvees. 
That was in the year 2000. Today, we have got 15,000 up-armored 114s, 
plus thousands of Humvees that have the so-called MAC kits which are 
also protective armor kits.

We had virtually no body armor in the year 2000. I don't believe we 
had a single set that was available for any line units in any American 
division in the world. Today, we have over 400,000 of those.

I just want to make a point, if there are American moms and dads, and 
we have had a few who have thought that their sons and daughters were 
going to Iraq without body armor, I have said, Call me personally at 
the office, and I have not had a single phone call in 2 years. So they 
have plenty of body armor.

And, lastly, I just want to make one other point with respect to what 
America has, because there has been an implication I think throughout 
the debate that we are stretched too thin, that others may attack us, 
may take advantage of the fact that we have deployments in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Since the year 2000, we have more than doubled the 
precision firepower of this country. That means the ability of this 
country, and Republicans and Democrats have supported the funding that 
has done this; but if any country in the world should think they are 
going to take advantage of an America that is, in their estimation, 
stretched too thin, the precision firepower, that means the ability to 
send a smart weapon on target to thread a goal post at many, many 
miles, has more than doubled since the year 2000. And so no country


that feels that there is that implication in our situation in Iraq and 
Afghanistan should bet their life on it, because they will lose.

Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to Mr. Cole, the outstanding 
gentleman from Fort Sill.
