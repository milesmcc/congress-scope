Mr. SALAZAR. I want to thank the gentleman for his comments. I think 
it is clear, with the figures that you have given us, that the $378 
billion is not really a true reflection of what the Iraqi war has cost 
us.

And you are absolutely right, we as Blue Dogs, we as Democrats will 
stand strong with our troops making sure that they have the equipment 
that they need, and that is one of the things I wanted to talk about 
tonight was the Iraq war supplemental that our leadership has proposed 
includes making sure that we take care of our veterans; it includes 
money for devastated farmers and ranchers across this country due to 
weather problems and other issues.

So I believe that this is the right thing to do. It is the right 
thing to do. But I would ask the administration to please look into 
trying some diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, and hopefully we can 
move this forward and bring our troops home as quickly and safely as 
possible. In the meantime, let us not forget the men and women in 
uniform who serve this country bravely. And I want to thank the 
gentleman for inviting me today to visit with the American public and 
tell them the truth about what is going on with America's budget.
