Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a fallen soldier from my district.

Jesus Flores, Jr., 28, from La Mirada, California, was killed in 
action on October 15 of this year in Afghanistan. He leaves behind his 
mother, father, four sisters, and one brother.

Jesus enlisted in the Navy straight from high school and served for 4 
years. In 2003, he enlisted in the Army. He became a combat specialist 
and was deployed to Iraq from February to May of 2009. He was on his 
first tour in Afghanistan when he was killed in action.

One of his sisters spoke of Jesus in this way: A loving son. A 
generous brother. A soldier who loved military life. This was apparent 
in the many medals adorning his uniform.

The people of this body and people throughout this country could not 
exist without the dedication and sacrifices from the soldiers who 
serve. Soldiers like Jesus. Soldiers who, above all else, want to honor 
this country, preserve our freedoms, and protect our families.

There is nothing that I can say or do to take away the pain his 
family feels at the loss of Jesus. But I hope they are comforted by 
knowing the memory of Specialist Jesus Flores will remain, and we will 
continue to honor his service every day.
