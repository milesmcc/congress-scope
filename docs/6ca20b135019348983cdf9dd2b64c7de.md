Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appreciate that answer. I think there is 
a provision--as a matter of fact, the amendment Senator Lugar and I 
filed has very much the same language in it. Let's proceed to No. 3.




 The Iraq Study Group noted that ''Al Qaeda will portray any 


 failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant victory 


 that will be featured prominently as they recruit for their 


 cause in the region and around the world.''


That concerns me. I think there is some truth to that statement.
