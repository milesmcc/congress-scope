Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, leadership is about getting results. I want to 
thank our leadership for bringing a bill to the floor for the first 
time that gets results.

I've never voted for funds for this war, and I've been waiting a long 
time to vote for a bill that would bring our troops home.

On March 20, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq. It was a mistake 
then, and every day we've failed to correct this mistake costs us in 
cash, in credibility, and in lives. Every day we are not working to get 
out of Iraq, we make our Nation weaker and less safe. Every day that we 
do not get our troops out of Iraq is another day of mistakes.

The road out of Iraq starts with the first step. This bill is the 
first beginning. To start a withdrawal, this bill jump-starts that 
withdrawal. It starts in 30 days.

Passing this bill tonight makes clear that the U.S. House of 
Representatives has acted to bring our troops home, to end this war, 
and to put our country back on the right track. This leadership 
deserves your support.
