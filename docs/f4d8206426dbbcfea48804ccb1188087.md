# NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008

`Mr. LEVIN â€” 11 July 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, again, I thank my good friend from 
Connecticut for his cooperation and for his modification of his 
amendment. I think it now will command and should command the 
overwhelming vote of the Senate. There is no division when it comes to 
threats to the troops of the United States. Those troops are threatened 
in many ways in Iraq, and one of the ways they are threatened is by the 
activities of Iranians.

We want to make it very clear to the Government of Iran that we speak 
as one when it comes to protecting those troops from those kinds of 
threats. I hope that message gets through to the leaders of Iran loudly 
and clearly as a result of the adoption--or the expected adoption--of 
the Lieberman amendment.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:10 today 
be for debate with respect to the Lieberman amendment No. 2073, as 
modified, with the time equally divided and controlled between Senator 
Lieberman and Senator Levin or their designees; that no amendments be 
in order to the Lieberman amendment prior to the vote; and that at 
4:10, without further intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed 
to vote in relation to the Lieberman amendment, as modified.
