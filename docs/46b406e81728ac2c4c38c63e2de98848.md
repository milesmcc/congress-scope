Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Virginia in response, at some 
point, the Iraqis have to take control of their country, their 
territory, and their future. It is certainly not in their best 
interest, if they want to develop, for example, an oil industry that is 
going to fuel their economy and improve the lives of the people, to 
allow terrorist groups to run without restraint.

So, yes, I think that is a concern they should have as a nation, and 
that is why the second part of the Levin-Reed amendment is so 
important. We reserve the right for American forces to help train and 
equip the Iraqi soldiers, Army, and police.

Fighting terrorism, we now see most often is a military function, but 
I think historically it has been a police function. Regardless of 
which, we reserve in the Levin-Reed amendment the right for America to 
continue to invest in the Iraqi Army and police force, for that very 
reason, so there is internal stability in Iraq, even as our combat 
forces are removed.
