Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, 4 years after the start of the war in Iraq, 
and less than 100 days since the swearing in of this new Congress, this 
Congress will act today.

I urge my colleagues to support this rule and this legislation so we 
can pass the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007. Let's send a 
message, let's stand up for our brave troops in the field, not just 
when they are serving on the battlefield, but when they return home. 
Let's give the families the respect they deserve and make sure that we 
are providing superior health care whether it's a physical injury or a 
mental scar.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ''yes'' vote on the previous question and on 
the rule.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the 
previous question on the resolution.
