Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and praise Sergeant 
Matthew Soper, a constituent of mine who died while serving his country 
in Iraq; Sgt. Soper's truck was hit by an IED in Iraq on June 6, 2007.

SGT Soper of Jackson was 25-years-old. Sergeant Matthew Soper served 
in the Michigan Army National Guard's 1461st Transportation Company 
based in Jackson. Sergeant Soper was courageous as he manned the front 
vehicle gun in his company.

SGT Soper's family has said the military changed their son and 
brother. His sister stated he joined the military to ''call something 
his own,'' and to make people proud. Nothing serves as greater evidence 
to the heart of this young man than his selflessness in volunteering 
for a second tour of duty in Iraq. SGT Soper's first tour was in 2004 
and 2005. I stand here today to tell the country and SGT Soper's family 
how proud of him I am.

The country mourns the loss of a soldier and we celebrate his life. 
My thoughts and prayers are with Matthew's family. I thank them for 
their beloved sons' dedicated service to the United States. May God be 
with them.
