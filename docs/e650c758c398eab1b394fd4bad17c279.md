Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, last weekend I was 
honored to travel with a delegation to visit our troops in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. I am grateful to report that I saw significant success 
while walking the market district of Haditha in Anbar province, Iraq, 
to driving across Asadabad, Afghanistan, to see a new bridge under 
construction.

Violence in Iraq has declined by over 60 percent since the beginning 
of the surge. In Afghanistan I appreciate the success of the 218th 
Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard, led by Brigadier 
General Bob Livingston, to train Afghani forces to secure their own 
homeland. The best way to protect American families at home is to stop 
terrorists overseas.

There are many challenges we face both in Iraq and Afghanistan, but 
the brave men and women fighting on the front lines have done 
everything we have asked of them. So let's do what they have asked of 
us. Let them complete the mission, protecting American families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
