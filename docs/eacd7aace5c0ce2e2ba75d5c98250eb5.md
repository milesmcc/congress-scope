`Mr. BIDEN â€” 26 September 2007`

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will oppose the Kyl-Lieberman amendment 
for one simple reason: this administration cannot be trusted.

I am very concerned about the evidence that suggests that Iran is 
engaged in destabilizing activities inside Iraq. I believe that many of 
the steps the Senators from Connecticut and Arizona suggest be taken to 
end this activity can be taken today. We can and we should move to act 
against Iranian forces inside Iraq. We can and we should use economic 
pressure against those who aid and abet attacks on our forces and 
against Iraqis. The administration already has the authority to do 
these things and it should be doing them.

Arguably, if we had a different President who abided by the meaning 
and intent of laws we pass, I might support this amendment. I fear, 
however, that this President might use the designation of Iran's 
Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity as a pretext to use 
force against Iran as he sees fit. While this may sound far-fetched to 
some, my colleagues should examine the record in two particular 
instances.

First, is the misuse of the authority that we granted the President 
in 2002 to back our diplomacy with the threat of force. My colleagues 
will remember that, at the time, we voted to give the President a 
strong hand to play at the U.N. to get the world to speak with one 
voice to Saddam: let the inspectors back in and disarm or be disarmed. 
We thought that would make war less likely.

But in the 5 months between our vote and the invasion of Iraq, the 
ideologues took over. The President went to war unnecessarily, without 
letting the weapons inspectors finish their work, without a real 
coalition, without enough troops, without the right equipment, and 
without a plan to secure the peace.

The second example is the administration's twisting of our vote on 
the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 as an endorsement of military action 
against Iraq. Let me quote the Vice President from November 2005:




 Permit me to burden you with a bit more history: In August 


 of 1998, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution urging 


 President Clinton take 'appropriate action' to compel Saddam 


 to come into compliance with his obligations to the Security 


 Council. Not a single senator voted no. Two months later, in 


 October of '98--again, without a single dissenting vote in 


 the United States Senate--the Congress passed the Iraq 


 Liberation Act. It explicitly adopted as American policy 


 supporting efforts to remove Saddam Hussein's regime from 


 power and promoting an Iraqi democracy in its place. And just 


 two months after signing the Iraq Liberation law, President 


 Clinton ordered that Iraq be bombed in an effort to destroy 


 facilities that he believed were connected to Saddam's 


 weapons of mass destruction programs.


The Vice President made this argument despite this explicit section 
of the Iraq Liberation Act: ''Nothing in this Act shall be construed to 
authorize or otherwise speak to the use of United States Armed 
Forces.''

These examples are relevant to the debate today.

The Authorization for the Use of Military Force approved in September 
2001 would appear to limit the scope of authority it contains to the 
terrorists who conducted or aided the attacks of 9/11, or harbored 
them. But the President and his lawyers have frequently argued for a 
broad reading of this law,


and believe they are fighting a ''global'' war on terrorism. In letters 
to Congress under the war powers resolution, the President has stated 
that he will ''direct additional measures as necessary'' in the 
exercise of self-defense and ''to protect U.S. citizens and interests'' 
as part of this global war.

I do not think the suggestion that the President designate an arm of 
the government of Iran as a ''terrorist'' entity provides any authority 
to do anything. After all, it is a nonbinding measure. But this 
administration already has an unduly broad view of the scope of 
executive power, particularly in time of war. I do not want to give the 
President and his lawyers any argument that Congress has somehow 
authorized military actions. The lesson of the last several years is 
that we must be cautious about acting impulsively on legislation which 
can be misconstrued, and misused to justify actions that Congress did 
not contemplate.

With a different President who had a different track record, I could 
vote to support this amendment. But given this President's actions and 
misuse of authority, I cannot support the amendment.
