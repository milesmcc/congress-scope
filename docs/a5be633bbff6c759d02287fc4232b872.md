Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you, Congresswoman Barbara Lee.

Quick statistics. Of the young men and women who have been killed in 
Iraq, total 3,734, 885 were less than 22; 1,013 were between 22 and 24; 
1,007 between the age of 25 and 30; 445 between the age of 31 and 35; 
and older than 35, 445

It gives me great pleasure at this time to yield to my good friend 
and colleague from the great State of California, the Chair of the Out 
of Iraq Caucus, Congresswoman Maxine Waters for such time as she may 
consume.
