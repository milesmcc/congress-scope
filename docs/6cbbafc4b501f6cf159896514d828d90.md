`Mr. REID â€” 12 July 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, there will be a period of morning business. 
Once that is closed, the Senate will resume the Defense authorization 
bill at which time an amendment from the Republican side is expected to 
be offered. Once we have disposed of the Republican amendment, the next 
first-degree amendment from the majority side will be the wounded 
warriors amendment to be offered by Chairman Levin.

I have met with my staff this morning, and they have been meeting 
with Republican staff on the committee. I have spoken to Senator Warner 
and Senator McCain. We want this bill to have a full airing. We want 
people to have the opportunity to offer amendments. We are going to try 
to work our way through the procedural morass we find when we have a 
complicated bill, but we hope when we complete this legislation next 
week, people will feel they have had an opportunity to offer 
amendments.

We know there are a number of issues relating to Iraq. We want to try 
to get those up and disposed of. There are some other amendments I know 
people want to offer, nonrelated amendments, but I hope we can hold 
back from doing that. We should keep this bill one related to defense. 
I hope we can do that. There will be other opportunities, as we proceed 
through legislation, to offer some of the important nonrelated matters.
