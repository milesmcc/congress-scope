Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.

I rise today to urge passage of this bill designating the facility of 
the United States Postal Service located at 59 Colby Corner in East 
Hampstead, New Hampshire, as the Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh Post 
Office. Described by his family as ''the epitome of an officer and a 
gentleman,'' Captain Jonathan Grassbaugh was a truly remarkable young 
man.

Born into a military family, Captain Grassbaugh moved to New 
Hampshire at the age of 3. After graduating from Phillips Exeter 
Academy, he attended Johns Hopkins University where he earned his 
degree in computer science. During his time at Hopkins, Jonathan rose 
quickly through the ranks of his Army ROTC class, selected as the cadet 
battalion commander his senior year. Jonathan's dedication and sense of 
honor served as a driving force behind the JHU Ranger Challenge team 
winning brigade competitions 2 years in a row and the battalion being 
rated third in the nation among 270 ROTC units.

In the words of one of his professors, ''In my 9 years of teaching 
ROTC, Jonathan Grassbaugh was by far one of the most energetic and 
conscientious young men that I have ever had the honor to teach.''

In 2005 during his first tour in Iraq, Captain Grassbaugh served as 
aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Michael Ferriter, a top adviser to 
the U.S. military commander in Iraq. Speaking at Jonathan's funeral, 
Ferriter commented on the young man he grew to know so well: ''He made 
me a better leader and a better man. He was simply as good as it gets. 
He was the best; a warrior, friend, comrade, loving husband, and caring 
son.''

In June of 2006, Jonathan married his college sweetheart, Jenna, just 
a few


days after her graduation from Hopkins. A few weeks later he was 
deployed to Iraq as a member of the 73rd Cavalry, 5th Brigade of the 
82nd Airborne Division. On April 7, 2007, the 25-year-old Grassbaugh 
was killed by an IED while conducting a combat logistic patrol in 
Zaganiyah, Iraq.

A loving husband, dedicated son, and accomplished soldier, Captain 
Grassbaugh was and will remain a shining example of America's best. 
Though we will never have the privilege of knowing the limits of his 
seemingly endless potential, the memory of his spirit, honor, and 
dedication should live on as an example to others. In the words of the 
Reverend Frederick Pennett at his funeral, ''He laid down his life for 
us and for his country. There is no greater love than this. Jonathan's 
story and his memory will go on forever.''

I urge that we help preserve the memory of Captain Jonathan 
Grassbaugh with passage of this bill, and I ask my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this fitting tribute.

I reserve the balance of my time.
