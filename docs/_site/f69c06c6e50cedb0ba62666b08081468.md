Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to honor the 
distinguished service of my fellow Hoosier, SFC Jeffrey E. Mittman.

Throughout his remarkable career in the U.S. Army, Sergeant Mittman 
has exemplified the professionalism and dedication that is a hallmark 
of our Nation's Armed Forces, including during deployments in support 
of Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi 
Freedom. On July 7, 2005, while assisting an Iraqi Public Order Brigade 
in Central Baghdad as a member of the Special Police Transition Team, 
SFC Jeffrey E. Mittman was wounded by an improvised explosive device. 
Since that day Sergeant Mittman has worked to recover from the injuries 
he sustained.

I also appreciate this opportunity to share my best wishes with 
Sergeant Mittman's wife Christy and children Jamie and Payton. As 
Sergeant Mittman works to recover from the grievous injuries he 
suffered while serving his nation in Iraq, I know that his children 
will benefit from the example of service and dedication that he and 
Christy have set.

I ask unanimous consent that a poem by Albert Caswell honoring SFC 
Jeffrey Mittman be printed in the Record.
