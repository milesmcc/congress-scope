Mr. BERMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I'm very proud to cosponsor this amendment with Mr. Skelton, the 
Chair of the committee, along with the Chair of the Subcommittee on 
State and Foreign Operations, Mrs. Lowey.

Among the many lessons learned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan 
is the stark fact that the State Department and Defense Department have 
failed to coordinate on critical policy issues in these two war zones. 
In fact, throughout the U.S. Government, there is a misalignment 
between resources and missions, expertise and funding.

The problems are most evident in the arena of stability and 
reconstruction operations, where the Defense Department has assumed the 
lion's share of responsibilities.

However, the Defense Department is now playing a greater role in a 
wide range of foreign assistance programs. By some estimates, more than 
20 percent of foreign aid now flows through the Pentagon.

Some of this can be attributed to a lack of capacity at State and 
USAID, a problem we're trying to address through legislation authored 
by Mr. Farr, which the House passed and is now a part of this bill.

But to the extent these problems result from a lack of coordination, 
we need to take steps to help ensure that the day-to-day plumbing of 
our national security agencies is sufficiently welded so that personnel 
from different departments have incentive to work together, and that 
the objectives of these departments are properly calibrated with 
overall U.S. Government priorities.

This amendment constitutes a first step in that direction. It 
establishes an advisory panel, structured to ensure that the three key 
agencies charged with protecting U.S. national security and promoting 
American interests abroad, State, Defense and USAID, have equal 
presence. I hope that the panel will work closely with these agencies 
to produce a report that is


practical, well-informed and, most important, directly applicable to 
their day-to-day operations.

The one thing I know is that if this panel creates a dynamic where 
these agencies work as well together as I have found the ability to 
work with the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, we can 
make a lot of progress here. It's a real honor to have been engaged 
with Chairman Skelton, as well as Chairwoman Lowey on the 
appropriations side, in trying to come to grips with this problem.

I think this is a good first step, and I urge my colleagues to adopt 
this amendment.
