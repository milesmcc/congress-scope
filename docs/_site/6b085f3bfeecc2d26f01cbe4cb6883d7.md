Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lance Corporal 
Joshua Bleill, a veteran of the Iraq War, a fine Marine and a bright 
light to many of us. I have had the privilege of meeting this 
impressive young man and I am honored to enter the following poem 
written by Burt Caswell of the Capitol Guide Service into the 
Congressional Record.















 A Bright Light
