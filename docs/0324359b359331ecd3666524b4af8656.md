Mr. ROSS. I thank Congressman Murphy from Pennsylvania for his 
insight and life experiences as a veteran of the Iraq War, and for 
sharing his thoughts with us this evening as we demand accountability 
and common sense on how your tax money, some $12 million an hour of 
your tax money, is being spent in Iraq. It is important, we believe, 
that we make sure that it is being spent on our troops, to protect and 
support them, and that it be accounted for.



That's what H. Res. 97 is all about, and we're very pleased, and we 
want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. 
Skelton, for including key provisions of our legislation, written in 
part by Mr. Murphy, in the Defense authorization bill this year.

I yield to an active member of the Blue Dog Coalition, gentleman from 
the State of Tennessee (Mr. Lincoln Davis).
