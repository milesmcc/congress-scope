`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 18 December 2007`

---


Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Virginia.

I rise to support the amendment I am privileged to cosponsor with the 
Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, which would give our troops, 
General Petraeus in the field, the funding they need to carry on the 
fight they are carrying on so successfully.

As a result, I rise to oppose the amendment introduced by my friend 
from Michigan and others. Nine months ago, when General Petraeus took 
command in Baghdad, people of good conscience could disagree about 
whether his new counterinsurgency strategy would succeed, unless you 
decided that everything was lost in Iraq or it did not matter if we 
lost in Iraq. I think most of us do not feel that way. We know it would 
matter, because we are engaged in a battle with al-Qaida, the same al-
Qaida that attacked us on 9/11, and Iran, the most significant state 
sponsor of terrorism, according to our own State Department, supporting 
militias and extremists in Iraq. So it matters.

But 9 months ago, people who cared about whether we won or lost in 
Iraq could argue about whether the surge strategy would work. After so 
many


mistakes, frankly, in the conduct of the war in Iraq, many Americans, 
many Members of this Chamber, were understandably skeptical about the 
possibility of this new counterinsurgency strategy succeeding.

Now, however, the evidence is unequivocal. I will say it is 
remarkable. In some cases it is downright miraculous. The surge is 
working. As a result, it is time to support General Petraeus, his plan, 
and his troops, not to second guess, not to editorialize about it, not 
to add conditions or goals to it.

Let's do something that we in Congress do not do very well, which is 
to remain silent in the face of something that is working. With all 
respect, the Levin amendment is a classic case of snatching defeat from 
the jaws of victory, because we are on the road to victory in Iraq.

The extra American troops have played a critical part, the broad-
scale counterinsurgency strategy. And what has happened? Violence is 
down. I think this number has been cited, but this week, MG Joseph Fil, 
who is the commander of our operations in Baghdad, said that attacks in 
the capital city have fallen nearly 80 percent since November of 2006; 
murders in Baghdad Province are down by 90 percent over the same 
period; and vehicle-borne bombs which have killed so many of our troops 
and the Iraqi people have dropped by 70 percent.

There is a people's uprising occurring in Iraq today. It started with 
the awakening in Anbar. It has now gone on to Baghdad and other 
provinces throughout the country. I know those sponsors of this 
amendment have said they want to send it as a message to the Iraqi 
national political leadership to get with it, to reconcile. Of course, 
we are all frustrated by their lack of progress in doing that. A lot of 
us thought that the political changes in Iraq would come from the top 
down. But what has happened is something not to disparage, not to 
ignore. What has happened is classically democratic, in the best 
traditions of America. The political changes in Iraq are coming from 
the bottom up, from the grassroots up. Local councils are governing in 
area after area. The local people have taken charge of their destiny. 
They have kicked out al-Qaida. They have kicked out al-Qaida because 
they decided that al-Qaida was their enemy. And we, much to their 
surprise, turned out to be their friends, their supporter. They 
understand we do not want conquest in Iraq. We want to liberate them 
from the forces of extremism. The same is happening throughout the 
country.

I urge my colleagues, let success alone. Let it work. Oppose the 
Levin-Reed amendment and support the McConnell-Lieberman amendment.

I yield the floor.
