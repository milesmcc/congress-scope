Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I could complete a quick thought and 
then turn to the Senator for his question, my thought was this: This is 
obviously a torturous issue for us as a nation, because we are 
basically a very good people. And our history shows that when we use 
force, we use it for the purposes of trying to free people, of giving 
people more options and a better lifestyle. We did it during World War 
I and World War II, and we did it throughout the Cold War. Our success 
is extraordinary. We have never sought territorial gain, and we do not. 
We seek to give people the opportunity to pursue the liberties and 
freedoms which were defined so brilliantly by our Founding Fathers. 
When we see something such as Iraq, where there seems to be such an 
inability of the culture to grasp these concepts, even though we are 
trying as hard as we can to give them that option, it is difficult.

But we still can't take our eye off the ball, which is to basically 
recognize that we are doing this for our national defense, as we try to 
stabilize a region that represents an immediate threat to us and has 
already damaged us more than any other event in our history has damaged 
us, other than potentially Pearl Harbor, and that we have troops in the 
field who need to be supported.

I yield to the Senator from Texas for a question.
