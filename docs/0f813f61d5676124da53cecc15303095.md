Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I wish to express my 
deepest sympathies for the people of India and Afghanistan after a 
cowardly homicide bomb attack outside the Indian Embassy in Kabul this 
morning. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families who have lost 
loved ones. As the former co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India 
and Indian Americans and current co-chair of the Afghanistan Caucus, I 
am personally concerned.

These bloodthirsty attacks are a clear sign that we face a determined 
enemy. But our fight in Afghanistan not just against terrorist elements 
like Al Qaeda who murdered Americans on September 11. We face a larger 
threat to the people and to the stability of the entire region 
especially our longtime partner Pakistan.

 We need to heed the advice of our commanders on the ground who are 
requesting more reinforcements and more resources. We need to implement 
a strategy that will capture or kill those responsible for terrorist 
acts as well as destroy their financial and logistical networks. We 
must ensure they will not find a safe haven anywhere from which to 
plot. I join with Republican Whip Eric Cantor to urge Democrats and 
Republicans to uphold President Barack Obama's campaign pledge to 
protect American families by defeating terrorists in Afghanistan.
