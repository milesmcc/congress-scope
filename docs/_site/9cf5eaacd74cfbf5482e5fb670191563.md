Mr. DURBIN. I ask through the Chair one last question. I don't know 
what the situation is with the New Jersey Guard, but many of the 
Illinois Guard have been deployed and redeployed in Iraq and 
Afghanistan at great inconvenience and hardship to their families. The 
McCain amendment calls for deployment within 72 hours. People will 
literally be removed from their families and on the road headed down to 
Arizona within 72 hours under the McCain amendment.

I ask the Senator if he has dealt with these Guard families and has 
any idea what impact this might have on their lives.
