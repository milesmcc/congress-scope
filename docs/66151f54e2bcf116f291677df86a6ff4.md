# STIFLING IRAQ DEBATE IN SENATE

`Mr. PALLONE â€” 7 February 2007`

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, democracy is based on the free exchange of 
ideas, debating issues to find a solution reasonable people can agree 
upon. However, when it comes to discussing the most important issue 
facing our Nation, the Senate Republican leadership is more concerned 
with giving the President political cover than engaging in a democratic 
debate of ideas.

The Republican Senate leadership is even blocking the voices in their 
own party by filibustering debate on any resolution dealing with the 
war in Iraq, including the McCain-Graham resolution supporting the 
President's troop surge and the Warner-Levin resolution in opposition 
to it. The consideration of these resolutions, especially the 
bipartisan Warner-Levin resolution, would serve as the basis for the 
first real debate on the President's flawed Iraq war policy since the 
war began nearly 4 years ago.

Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve a democratic discussion of 
ideas on the issue that is most important to them. Next week we will 
have a debate here in the House that will allow each of us to speak our 
minds on the President's plan, and I would hope that the Senate 
leadership would allow the same debate over in the other Chamber.
