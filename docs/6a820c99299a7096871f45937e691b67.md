Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for his 
comments. And I would just point out that we are in unprecedented 
times. We are in a time when we are conducting two wars overseas, one 
ending in Iraq and one continuing in Afghanistan. And that requires 
increases in military spending. It continues to require increases in 
veteran spending, which we have done. We have seen unprecedented 
natural disasters, which we have had to spend upon. We have seen an 
economy in a downturn. As a result of those things, it is necessary for 
spending to take place. I think my friend knows that.

With that, I will yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from South 
Dakota, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, Ms. Herseth Sandlin.
