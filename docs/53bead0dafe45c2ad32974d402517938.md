Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 336. 
There is no greater American hero than the military veteran, and I am 
proud to join my fellow colleagues today in honoring the sacrifices and 
contributions of our disabled American veterans.

The American soldier is the embodiment of hard work, patriotism, and 
service, and the soldier who has sacrificed his body for the freedom 
and liberty of others around the world deserves our utmost respect. The 
blood spilled on our own soil and abroad is a lasting reminder of the 
commitment that our soldiers have sacrificed for us all, and every 
citizen owes a deep and lasting gratitude to these brave warriors.

Madam Speaker, our departed soldiers must never be forgotten, and 
those injured veterans from wars past and those just returning from the 
battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan should receive our Nation's and 
this Congress's unwavering support and reverence. It is an honor to 
rise today and praise the bravest of all Americans--the disabled 
military veteran. America will never forget your valor during our most 
trying times, and we are forever grateful for your dedicated service 
and selfless sacrifice to our Nation.
