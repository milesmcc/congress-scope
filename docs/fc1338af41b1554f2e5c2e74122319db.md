Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the Senate is in its second week of 
debate on the future of U.S. military engagement in Iraq. It is a very 
timely and momentous debate which reflects the American people's 
concerns with events in Iraq, and I am hopeful more of my colleagues 
will join those of us who have voted over and over again to limit the 
U.S. engagement in Iraq.

I opposed this war from the start, and I have long advocated for 
responsible change of course in the administration's policy. I believe 
the best that we can do for our troops, for our national interests, and 
for the Iraqis themselves is to begin transitioning to Iraqi authority 
and to begin bringing our troops home in a responsible way, to remove 
the bulk of U.S. combat forces by the spring of next year.

I remember being at the funeral for one of our brave, fallen soldiers 
in Minnesota and hearing a priest say--he noted that this young man was 
a strong, strapping boy. He was over 6 feet tall. He said the kids we 
are sending over there may be over 6 feet tall,


but they are still our children. If they are over 6 feet tall, then our 
leaders must be 8 feet tall in making these difficult decisions. I hope 
this week this Congress stands tall, this Senate stands tall and makes 
the right decision.
