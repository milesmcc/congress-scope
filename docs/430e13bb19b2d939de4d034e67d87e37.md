Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise today to honor 
Nebraska Army National Guard Sergeant Heather Springer, in recognition 
of receiving the Army Veterans' Association Medic of the Year award and 
the Bronze Star Medal for Valor.

Sergeant Springer is a native of Lincoln, NE, and currently attends 
the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing. She 
joined the Nebraska Army National Guard on April, 8, 2004, and served 
with the 313th Ground Ambulance and 110th Medical Battalion. On March 
1, 2006, Sergeant Springer transferred to Charlie Company 2-135 General 
Support Aviation Battalion, 36th Combat Brigade, to become a flight 
medic. Soon after, she was deployed to Iraq in Diyala Province in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

On July 15, 2007, Sergeant Springer was transported to a landing zone 
where several U.S. soldiers had been struck by a roadside bomb. While 
conducting treatment for a critically injured soldier, her team 
suddenly came under enemy fire. She immediately secured the wounded 
soldier she was attending to and then moved 10 meters to a second 
wounded soldier, willingly exposing herself to open fire. During this 
hostile situation, Sergeant Springer remained composed and demonstrated 
assertive judgment by concluding that the wounds sustained by the first 
soldier were more critical. She determinedly led part of her team 
through 60 meters of open road, completely susceptible to enemy fire, 
to secure the soldier inside a Black Hawk helicopter. Once inside the 
helicopter, Sergeant Springer noticed that the second wounded soldier 
she had attended to was being moved towards the helicopter, and 
instantly moved to help safely transport the soldier aboard the 
aircraft.

Sergeant Springer displayed remarkable courage and selflessness while 
placing her own life at risk. These two wounded warriors are alive 
today as a direct result of her steadfastness and superb medical 
skills. The DUSTOFF--Dedicated Unhesitating Service to Our Fighting 
Forces--Association recently awarded her the DUSTOFF Medic of the Year 
award. The DUSTOFF Association is a nonprofit organization for the Army 
Medical Department's enlisted and officer personnel, aviation crew 
members, and others who have actively supported Army aeromedical 
evacuation programs in war or in peacetime.

Sergeant Heather Springer's admirable performance in Iraq led her to 
become the second woman in Nebraska National Guard history to receive 
the Bronze Star Medal for Valor. I wish Sergeant Springer all the best 
as she pursues her education in nursing school, and join all Nebraskans 
in honoring the heroism of this exceptional soldier.
