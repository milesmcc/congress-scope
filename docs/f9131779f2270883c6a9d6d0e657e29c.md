Mr. REID. It was the one, I say to my friend, dealing with Iraq. I 
only indicated just for general information what we were going to do on 
the immigration matter. This is the House-passed version of the 
supplemental that we can move to when we decide it is necessary, in 
spite of the fact that we may be involved, but for this agreement, in 
the postcloture proceedings.
