Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, you would never know it from our debate 
the last couple of weeks, but we are here to talk about the Defense 
authorization bill, this rather large bill that is at all of our desks. 
Much broader than just any particular conversation about Iraq, or any 
particular battle, this is to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 
2008, for military activities and the Department of Defense, for 
military construction, for defense activities and the Department of 
Energy, to proscribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, 
and other purposes.

One of the most important bills that we debate and pass, this 
includes money for aircraft, missiles, weapons systems, vehicles, all 
of the things we need to protect and secure our country--a very 
important bill.

I appreciate that the minority a number of times this evening has 
said: We need to go ahead and vote, particularly on the amendment in 
front of us, the Levin amendment. And while the normal procedure is to 
get agreements between the sides on when we vote, the minority filed 
cloture on this bill. There is really no need to delay the cloture vote 
any further.
