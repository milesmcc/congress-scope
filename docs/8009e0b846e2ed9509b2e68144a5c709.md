Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, picture in your mind an American soldier, a corporal, 
patrolling in Afghanistan, wearing his American-made uniform, carrying 
his American-made M4 rifle, having been transported in an MRAP security 
vehicle to his place of patrolling, with a radio on his back which was 
made in America--all of these items furnished by the Congress of the 
United States and under our duty and the duty to train and to allow him 
to be fully prepared to fight the fight that he is.

That is what is important in what we do today. That is the purpose of 
an authorization bill. It is required by the Constitution of the United 
States. It is paramount. It is the most important job that we have to 
do--to provide for the security of those who fight and who protect us 
in their line of duty.

I yield back the balance of my time.
