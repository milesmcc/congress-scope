`Ms. SNOWE â€” 5 March 2009`

---

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, at a time when our Nation is 
involved in a global war on terrorism, thousands of lives are disrupted 
as members of our armed services head off to war. One aspect that is 
often overlooked is the profound impact a deployment can have on a 
servicemember's civilian career. I wish today to commend a small 
business from my home State of Maine that has made a veritable 
commitment to ensuring that those serving our country are seamlessly 
reintegrated into the workforce upon their return from Active Duty, and 
their families taken care of while they are gone.

Maine Oxy is an Auburn-based company that specializes in welding, as 
well as industrial and specialty gases. A third generation family 
managed firm, Maine Oxy was founded in 1929 by Joseph W. Albiston as 
Maine Gas Service, which at that time provided sales and service to 
home propane customers. Six years later, Maine Oxy began providing 
welding supplies and industrial gases for customers throughout 
Androscoggin County, in central Maine. Since that time, Maine Oxy has 
expanded to serve three States in eight locations, including a state-
of-the-art acetylene production facility. It has also established a 
cutting-edge Spec Air gas manufacturing laboratory, as well as the New 
England School of Metalwork, with programs in welding and 
blacksmithing, as part of its sustained growth.

As a company that truly looks after its own, Maine Oxy has excelled 
in assisting its employees who serve in the military. Three such 
members from Maine Oxy's Auburn facility--Robert Smith, Kirby 
Touchette, and Scott St. Pierre--were all recently called up to Active 
Duty as combat engineers. During their deployment, Maine Oxy assisted 
the servicemembers by sending them care packages, and also aided their 
families by helping them with various chores, including chopping 
firewood for one the families that needed it. Even now, Maine Oxy 
continues to send dozens of care packages to troops in Iraq.

Upon their return, the three deployed employees were encouraged to 
make use of their maximum allocated 90-day entitlement of time off 
before returning to work. Moreover, the company was flexible in 
allowing for follow-up medical appointments. Finally, the firm rehired 
the employees and promoted them to new positions, thereby allowing 
their replacement workers to maintain employment as well.

Maine has one of the highest percentages of veterans in the country 
at roughly 16 percent of the State's population. Our State is seeing 
hundreds of new veterans each year returning from combat in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. As such, it is heartening to see companies like Maine Oxy 
standing ready to assist its veteran employees in such a broad and 
altruistic manner. Thank you to Bruce Albiston, Maine Oxy's Chief 
Executive Officer, and everyone at Maine Oxy for their selfless support 
of their colleagues, and best wishes for their future success.
