Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent MacDill 
Air Force Base back home in Tampa, Florida, where the mission partners 
include the 6th Air Mobility Wing, Special Operations Command, and 
Central Command. Now, the Democrats will bring the defense bill to the 
floor of the House this week to provide them with the tools they need 
to be successful in their missions.

The defense bill will follow a strong commitment by this Congress 
under Democratic leadership to our military families and our military 
personnel:

One, robust pay raises for our military over the past 3 years.

Two, the new GI Bill, where Democrats restored the promise to these 
brave men and women who have served this country in Iraq and 
Afghanistan for a full 4-year scholarship.

Jobs for veterans. The Recovery Act provided tax incentives to 
businesses who are sending soldiers off to war.

And a historic veterans budget that the American Legion hailed as a 
''cause for celebration'' because Democrats led a bipartisan effort to 
adopt the largest funding increase in veterans health care and other 
services in the history of the VA.
