Mr. LEVIN. I want to thank my friends from Massachusetts, Maryland 
and Oregon for their support. As I have said before, the United States 
has a special responsibility to assist those individuals fleeing Iraq 
and particularly to those individuals who assisted the United States. 
In the case of this legislation, it is the intent of the conferees to 
provide Iraqi SIVs the full array of benefits traditionally provided to 
refugees as described by my friend from Maryland.
