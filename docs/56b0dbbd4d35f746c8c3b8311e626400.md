Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in disbelief at the actions of 
the Democratic Senators' resolutions against the United States efforts 
in Iraq. These very same Senators voted unanimously to confirm General 
David Petraeus. It is unbelievably hypocritical to undermine the 
efforts of the very man they confirmed, along with all the brave men 
and women who serve with him.

The actions of these Senators will simply encourage the terrorists 
and undermine the U.S. efforts to succeed in Iraq and the war on 
terror. Republicans want to debate this issue, yet the Democrats only 
want to pass a resolution. It is time to take a real stand on the 
issue. If the Democrats want to end the war, then they should stand up 
and call for it.

The hypocritical actions of the Democrats are wrong. They have 
offered no plan for success in Iraq and are interfering with the 
President's powers to execute a war that the Congress has already 
approved. Democrats must realize there is only one commander-in-chief, 
and it is his job and responsibility to manage the war as he sees fit.

Mr. Speaker, I support my Republican colleagues in the Senate who 
want a real debate on this issue and victory in the central front on 
the global war on terror.
