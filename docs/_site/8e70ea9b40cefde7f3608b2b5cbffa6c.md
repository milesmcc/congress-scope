Mr. HUNTER. We have been up as high as 40 percent National Guard and 
Reserve, and that is a deliberate policy of the United States. When we 
went to war in Vietnam, the Guard and Reserve for practical purposes 
stayed home. And we said from here on out, when we go to war, we go to 
war with what is known as a total force.

So you have a Reserve element that goes to war. If you were over in 
Iraq, as the gentlelady has been there a number of times, you will see 
Reservists flying C-130s, doing a lot of support missions, and you have 
National Guard units on the ground.
