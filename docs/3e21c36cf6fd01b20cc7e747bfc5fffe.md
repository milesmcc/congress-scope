# ARMENIAN RESOLUTION
## `3e21c36cf6fd01b20cc7e747bfc5fffe`
`Mr. WARNER â€” 18 October 2007`

---


Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am greatly concerned. I had breakfast 
early this morning, together with the Senator from Michigan, the 
chairman of our committee, and two House senior Members of the Armed 
Services Committee--our annual meeting to work toward conference of the 
authorization bill--Secretary Gates and the new Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs, the Admiral. We addressed this issue of the Armenian resolution 
in the House. I do not in any way imply that the House has moved 
forward on that in an improper way. I don't want to get into the 
politics. I simply say I perceive that this is changing, a changing 
issue in the House. It may well not be brought up. But the Secretary of 
Defense again, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, reiterated the 
possible impact of such a resolution, were it to be passed, upon our 
operating forces, both in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
