`Ms. FOXX â€” 10 September 2007`

---


Ms. FOXX. Thank you, Mr. Gingrey. I appreciate your allowing me to 
join you and these other very articulate people who are here tonight 
speaking on this issue.

I was not here as a Member of Congress on 9/11/2001, but I am very 
pleased to be here tonight. As we were outside singing The Star 
Spangled Banner and our colleagues in the majority were talking about 
our being united, I was thinking about the fourth verse of The Star 
Spangled Banner, which very seldom gets sung, but I think is something 
that is so appropriate for the time that we are in right now.

This is the way it goes. I know it by heart, but I didn't want to 
take a chance tonight, so I am going to look at my notes just in case. 
It is really my favorite verse.



 ''O, thus be it ever when free-men shall stand,


 Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;


 Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land


 Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation.



 Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,




 And this be our motto: ''In God is our trust.''


 And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave


 O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.''


When Francis Scott Key wrote those words in 1814, they meant a lot. 
They mean just as much or more now, and I am, like my colleagues, 
absolutely appalled at the approach that has been taken to the 
situation that we are in now by many on the Democratic side.

It is appalling that they would question the integrity of the very 
men and women who are giving them the chance to stand up and lambaste 
them and slander them the way they are. They completely have forgotten 
what happened on 9/11. Many American people have forgotten. They don't 
understand the threat that this country is under and what we are doing 
to preserve our freedom.

There is such irony in the fact that these people would get up and 
say this again against the people who are risking their lives so they 
can stand up in the safety of this country and speak freely. It just 
absolutely blows my mind that they are able to do that. They are being 
given the ability to speak freely by people risking their lives and 
people losing their lives every day.

There is an arrogance of this Congress too, I think, the arrogance 
that demanded this report, the arrogance that says we are failing, 
when, in the face of all of the statistics, things are going so much 
better. There is an arrogance that says that if there is no strong 
national government, then things aren't going right.

You know, people have forgotten that this country was founded to have 
a strong local and State governmental structure, and the local and 
state governmental structures in Iraq are working well. No, it is not 
going as well as the national level, but compare what we have done with 
what they have done. We have accomplished very little under the 
leadership of this Democratic house in the last 8 months; very, very 
little. You compare that to what they have been able to achieve and 
think about us.

I spoke to a class today, three classes, actually, in my district, 
and I said to those students, the American people really don't realize 
in many ways the radical idea that this country was when we were 
formed. When people came to the United States, before it was the United 
States, they came here for freedom. They came seeking freedom. All they 
had ever known was freedom.



When Britain tried to clamp down on us, people said we are not going 
to put up with that. All the people in this country have ever known is 
freedom. All the people of Iraq have ever known is repression. We have 
asked them to do in a couple of years what took many years to develop 
in this country; and, again, it was a totally radical idea never 
perpetuated anywhere before. And yet they are doing very well at the 
local and provincial level, just like we did.

And now this Congress comes in and says if you don't have a strong 
national government, you have nothing. You are a failure. That is just 
not true. And I am simply appalled, too, at the people who want us to 
lose. How can they not understand the impact of our losing the war 
against the radical Islamic jihadists? This is not a war in Iraq; this 
is a worldwide war. One piece is in Iraq, and in many ways we are 
blessed that we have a concentration there where we can deal with it, 
because we are stopping them all over. They have not attacked us again. 
We have successfully defended ourselves from another attack, but they 
simply do not want to acknowledge it. All they see are the negatives, 
nothing positive.

And I, again, am appalled at the attitude of the people who want the 
United States of America to fail. My attitude to them is if you can 
find a better place to live, go live there. If you can't, then stay 
here, help us defend this country. Help us support our troops willingly 
to fight for our freedom. Help us to bring liberty to other places in 
the world. Then we will see a safe world. If not, go someplace else and 
live.
