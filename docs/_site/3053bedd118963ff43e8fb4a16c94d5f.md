Mr. McCOTTER. You've brought up the Constitution. Previously, we had 
heard throughout the energy debate that there is about $10 billion a 
month being spent in Iraq.

Will the gentlelady please tell the Democratic Congress who controls 
the power of the purse to appropriate those billions of dollars to 
Iraq?
