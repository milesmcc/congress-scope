Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
support for H. Res. 519 and join with our neighbors to the North in 
celebration of Canada Day.

On July 1st, 1867, the British North America Act went into effect, 
officially uniting the British North American colonies into one self-
governing federation called Canada.

Earlier this month, Canadians across North America celebrated the 
anniversary of their country's birth, their long tradition of 
democracy, and their national achievements.

The United States shares in the celebration of this special day 
because we have strong economic, political and cultural ties with 
Canada.

Washington State's 2nd Congressional District, which I represent, 
contains over 60 miles of our common border with Canada. As a member of 
the Northern Border Caucus, I view our partnership with Canada as one 
that is vital to both of our countries' national security and economic 
prosperity.

With nearly $600 billion in goods and millions of people crossing the 
border each year, Canada is not only the United States' largest trading 
partner, but also a key international ally.

In addition to sharing a common border that spans more than 5,500 
miles, the United States and Canada share a deep commitment to 
democratic principles. It is because of this commitment that our 
governments have worked so closely to address the common challenges we 
face, such as narcotics and terrorism. And it is in defense of these 
same democratic principles that our servicemen and women have fought 
side by side in Afghanistan and throughout the world.

I congratulate Canada on the occasion of the 142nd Canada Day and I 
look forward to celebrating with them for many years to come.
