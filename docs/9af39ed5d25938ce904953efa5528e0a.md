# OPPOSING ARMENIAN GENOCIDE RESOLUTION
## `9af39ed5d25938ce904953efa5528e0a`
`Mr. WHITFIELD â€” 10 October 2007`

Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose a nonbinding 
resolution that will have serious negative consequences to our national 
security.

H. Res. 106, the Armenian Genocide resolution, is a dangerously 
short-sighted and controversial resolution that is being marked up in 
the Foreign Affairs Committee today. This resolution will jeopardize 
our relationship with a strong NATO ally, Turkey, and hinder our 
ability to combat the global war on terror. This resolution makes 
assertions about facts that historians to this date still debate.

I might add that every living former Secretary of State, both 
Democrat and Republican, recently sent a letter to the Speaker stating 
that passage of this resolution would ''strain our relations with 
Turkey, endanger our national security interests, including the safety 
of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.''

I would also point out that in today's Washington Post in an 
editorial, it said that ''passage of the Armenian Genocide resolution 
would be dangerous and grossly irresponsible.'' I hope the Foreign 
Affairs Committee today will reject this resolution.
