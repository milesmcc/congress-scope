Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of House Resolution 1009, which honors the seven Americans who 
died in the bombing that took place in Khost, Afghanistan on December 
30, 2009, and the families of those patriots for their service and 
their sacrifice to our country.

These men and women were on the front lines of the battle against 
terrorism and worked tirelessly on a daily basis for the safety of the 
American and Afghanistan people. Their absence will be greatly felt 
throughout the intelligence community.

In 2008, I had the opportunity to visit Khost with the 101st Airborne 
Division of the U.S. Army along with a Texas Reserve Unit based in 
Pasadena, Texas in our district. There, I saw these men and women 
working under harsh conditions, away from their loved ones, and in the 
face of great risks. Our entire nation owes a great debt to all the men 
and women working to protect our country and stabilize Afghanistan.

Again, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the 
families, friends, and loved ones of those killed in the bombings and 
also offer my support and hope for a full recovery to the other six 
Americans who were wounded in this tragic bombing.
