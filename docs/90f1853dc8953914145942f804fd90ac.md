`Mr. AKIN â€” 20 May 2009`

Mr. AKIN. That's absolutely right. I appreciate the gentleman's 
perspective, and that's coming from a judge.

You want to know what has happened and exactly what's going on. Don't 
put this behind smoke and mirrors. We're talking here about comparing 
the cost of these taxes being proposed. This is the cost of World War 
II right here, this big blue circle. This cap-and-trade here at $1.9 
trillion is a tremendous, tremendous tax. The other wars--this thing 
here--would be the war in Afghanistan and the terrorist wars and all. 
All of these are small by comparison to what's being proposed.

So what does that mean for the average family? What are their costs 
going to be?

Well, you can see the energy here. The blue here is gasoline, and the 
gasoline is going to jump 16 percent. This is just by 2012. You're 
going to see a 16 percent increase in the cost of gasoline. The green 
is electricity. That's going to jump 9 percent, and that's just the 
beginning. That's only by 2012. Then you've got natural gas, which is 
going to jump 14 percent. Now, when the economy is rough and people are 
having trouble with unemployment, this somehow or other seems like a 
pretty strange thing to be talking about, a massive tax increase like 
this.

We're joined by my good friend from Georgia, and I would yield time 
to the doctor.
