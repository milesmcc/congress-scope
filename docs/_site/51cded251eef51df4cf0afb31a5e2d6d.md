`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 29 July 2008`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend the world 
was reminded that we face a global war on terrorism. Terrorists 
murdered or maimed hundreds of innocent civilians in India, Turkey, and 
most recently, yesterday in Iraq. These attacks, which numbered well 
over a dozen, are a stark reminder of the hideous nature of the enemy, 
who have declared war on modern civilization.

The groups responsible for these attacks are not always the same 
people. However, their motives in disrupting peace and prosperity and 
taking the lives of innocent individuals are the same as those who seek 
to kill American families. That is why we must stand together with our 
allies against such heinous attacks.

I want to express my deepest sympathies to the people of India, 
Turkey, and Iraq. If we are to defeat those who will murder innocent 
civilians and destroy the prosperity of free Nations, then we must work 
together. Despite their best efforts, our enemy's brazen disregard for 
innocent life will only strengthen our resolve.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
