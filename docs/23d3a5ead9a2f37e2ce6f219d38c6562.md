# THE COST OF NOT HAVING HEALTH CARE
## `23d3a5ead9a2f37e2ce6f219d38c6562`
`Mr. GRAYSON â€” 4 November 2009`

Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, during the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln, our


President, often pardoned people who had been convicted of treason. You 
may wonder why he did that. The answer is he saw death all around him 
in the Civil War, and he wanted to make sure he did nothing to add to 
it, so he pardoned people who had been found guilty of the most 
grievous crime one could commit in this country simply because he loved 
life.

In the same way, I would like to think whether I leave here after 2 
years or 20 years, that there will be no blood on my hands. That is why 
I am against the war in Iraq, that is why I am against the war in 
Afghanistan, and that is why I am so much in favor of health care 
reform that saves lives in America.

We had a different kind of President for 8 years recently, and we had 
a different kind of administration, an administration that was willing 
to bear any degree of suffering and pain as long as it was somebody 
else's. If you were homeless, it was your fault; if you were jobless, 
it was your fault; and if you died because you had no health insurance, 
that was your fault.

Now that administration is out of power. We, the American people, 
removed them because they abused it. But they have left behind in the 
House and in the Senate people who feel much the way that they did.

Recently, a Harvard study published in a peer review journal, the 
American Journal of Public Health, announced that 44,789 Americans die 
every single year because they have no health insurance.

In America today, if you find two people who are physically 
identical, same race, same age, same gender, same smoking habits, same 
weight, if you find two people who are physically identical, and one of 
them has insurance and the other one does not, then the one without 
insurance, that American who has the misfortune simply not to have 
health coverage, that American is 40 percent more likely to die.

This bill that we are considering now to reform health care in 
America would end that. It covers 96 percent of all Americans. It ends 
this grievous national tragedy where, day after day, week after week, 
month after month, 122 of us die every single day because they have no 
health insurance.

Now, I am sure that if we learned that al Qaeda was going to launch 
an attack on the United States and kill 44,789 Americans at any time 
next year, I am sure that we would do anything in our power to prevent 
that. I submit to you we should do the same about this. We should do 
exactly the same here, because we face the same threat. It is a less 
visible threat, it has gone on for generations, but it is a threat 
nevertheless. If you don't let people see the doctor, then a certain 
number of them are going to die.

To bring this point home in the face of united opposition by that 
side of the aisle, what we have done is something very simple. The 
Urban Institute has published the number of uninsured people in each 
district, each congressional district in this country. The American 
Journal of Public Health has told us what percentage of those uninsured 
people will die next year because they have no health insurance. So 
what we have done is very simple. We have taken one number and the 
other number, and through the magic of multiplication, we know how many 
of those people will die, and I think it is time we called attention to 
that.

So what we have done is for each Republican Member, since they are 
united in opposition to this bill, and apparently proud of it, for each 
Republican Member we have identified in each district the number of 
dead.

Alabama District 1, Congressman Jo Bonner, 114 dead.
