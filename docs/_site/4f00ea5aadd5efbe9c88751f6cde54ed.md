`Mr. ROSS â€” 6 March 2007`

Mr. ROSS. An important member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of 
fiscally conservative Democrats who spends many a Tuesday night here on 
the floor with me talking about the need to restore common sense and 
fiscal discipline to our Federal Government.

Why? Because today the U.S. national debt is $8,811,969,377,773 and 
some change. For every man, woman and child in America, their share, 
our share of the national debt is $29,245. It is what those of us in 
the Blue Dog Coalition have coined as the debt tax, d-e-b-t, and that 
is one tax that cannot go awayand cannot be cut until our Nation gets 
its fiscal House in order.

Why is this important? Our Nation is borrowing nearly $1 billion a 
day. In addition to billing $1 billion a day, we are spending about 
half a billion every day paying interest on the debt we already got 
before it goes up another $1 billion today, a half a billion dollars a 
day. What could we do with that?

Just in my district alone, give me three days' interest on the 
national debt, and I could complete I-49 across the western side of 
Arkansas. Give me another three days' interest on the national debt, 
and I could complete I-69 through the delta region of south Arkansas, 
two important interstate road projects that could help create economic 
opportunities and lift up one of the poorest regions in our country.

Yet these priorities continue to go unmet. Why? Because of a lack of 
fiscal discipline, because too much of your hard-earned tax money is 
going to pay interest, not principal, but just interest on the national 
debt. Year after year, it is hard now to believe, but from 1998 to 
2001, we had a balanced budget in this country and a surplus, the first 
time either a Democrat or a Republican had given us that, in about 40 
years.

Yet, we have squandered that, this administration and this Republican 
Congress, for the past 6 years, year after year, have given us the 
largest deficit ever in our Nation's history and the largest debt ever 
in our Nation's history.

In fact, to put it in perspective, the total national debt from 1789 
to 2000 was $5.67 trillion. But for 2010, the total national debt will 
have increased to nearly $11 trillion. That is a doubling of the 211-
year debt in just 10 years. Interest payments on this debt are one of 
the fastest-growing parts of the Federal budget, the debt tax we call 
it, d-e-b-t; and it is one tax that cannot be repealed.

Our Nation is spending more money paying interest on national debt 
than we are educating our children. If that is not wrong, I don't know 
what is. It is morally wrong.

Well, you could see the current national debt is at an all-time high. 
Why do deficits matter? Because they do reduce economic growth. They 
burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. They increase 
our reliance on foreign lenders who now own 40 percent of our debt. Mr. 
Speaker, this administration in the past 6 years has borrowed more 
money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the 
previous 42 Presidents combined.

Mr. Speaker, you might be surprised at who they are. It is kind of 
like David Letterman and his Top 10 list. Here is the Top 10 list of 
people that we have gone out and borrowed money from in the last 6 
years. The United States of America goes out to other countries and 
borrows money to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over 
$400,000 a year.

Here is the Top 10, we have borrowed, the United States of America 
has borrowed, $637.4 billion from Japan; China, $346.5 billion; the 
United Kingdom, $223.5 billion. You will love this one, OPEC, the 
United States of America has borrowed $97.1 billion from OPEC; Korea, 
$67.7 billion; Taiwan, $63.2 billion; the Caribbean Banking Centers, 
$63.6 billion; Hong Kong, $51 billion; Germany, $52.1 billion.

Rounding out the Top 10 countries, where the United States of America 
has gone and borrowed money from foreign central banks and foreign 
lenders, you will not believe this one, Mexico. The United States of 
America has borrowed $38.2 billion from Mexico to fund tax cuts in this 
country for people who earn over $400,000 a year.

We are trying to fix this, and in this new Democratic majority, I am 
proud to tell you that not in the first 100 hours, but the first 24 
hours, the new Democratic leadership listened to the 43-member strong 
fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition and reinstituted 
what is known as the PAYGO rules, which means pay-as-you-go. Those were 
the rules that were in place on this House floor from 1998 through 2001 
when President Clinton gave this Nation its last balanced budget.



Some Republicans will have you believe, oh, that means they want to 
raise taxes to fund a program. Not so. That means that we think you 
should review programs and find programs that don't work and cut them 
to pay for new programs. Pay-as-you-go does not mean raise taxes to 
fund a new program. It means restore accountability to our government, 
no more rubber-stamp Congress.

It means we are going to demand accountability from our Federal 
agencies; and when programs don't work, and when agencies don't know 
how to administer them, we are going to cut them and use that money to 
fund other programs that can work.

Well, we have talked a lot this evening about accountability, and I 
am real proud to be joined by one of the authors of our Iraq War 
Accountability Act. We support our troops. In fact, the gentleman here 
with me tonight, from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murphy, is an Iraqi war 
veteran. My brother-in-law is serving tonight in the Middle East.

We support our troops, but we also want to make sure that this $12 
million an hour of your tax money that is being sent to Iraq is 
accounted for, and that it is being spent on our troops to protect them 
so they can return home safely.

For the remaining 5 or 10 minutes we have got this evening, I 
recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, a new member but an 
important member of the Blue Dog Coalition, Mr. Murphy.
