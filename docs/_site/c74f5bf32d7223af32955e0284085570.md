Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today is a special day: one which is 
special to me and the nearly 2 million residents of the State of West 
Virginia. On this day in 1863 West Virginia entered the Union as the 
35th State.

West Virginia is America. West Virginia is a place where people are 
proud of who they are and not what they have. It is a place where 
neighbor helping neighbor means something. Where community, faith, and 
family are not taken for granted.

The area now known as West Virginia was originally settled thousands 
of years ago by Native Americans. The 17th and 18th centuries saw the 
first pioneering European settlers who came across the Appalachians 
looking for an expansive new homestead. The 19th century saw America's 
darkest hour in the Civil War. But, it was in this conflict that 
Western Virginia separated from Virginia standing on its own, faithful 
the Union, and earning statehood. From that day to today, West Virginia 
has been an important part of America.

Our coal powers America. Our steel built America's cities from the 
ground up. Our timber built America's homes. Our chemical industry has 
improved the quality of life for all Americans. And yet today, it is 
another resource, West Virginia's most precious one, this is driving a 
new generation of West Virginians. West Virginia is home to some of the 
most pristine natural beauty in our Nation. Visitors from around the 
country--around the world--come to take in the majestic mountain 
vistas, explore our forests, celebrate our Appalachian heritage, fish, 
ski, and hit the links, and most importantly spread time with our 
people.

So, just who are these people? They have stout hearts, courage, and 
an unfaltering determination. These qualities are particularly evident 
in West Virginia veterans like Chester Merriman, the youngest person to 
serve in World War I at just 14 years of age, or Hershel ''Woody'' 
Williams, who received a Congressional Medal of Honor in World War II 
for his heroism during the Battle for Iwo Jima, epitomize how West 
Virginians have proudly served their country no matter when--from the 
Civil War to today's conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, there 
are more than 200,000 veterans living in the State giving West Virginia 
the highest per capita of any State in the country.

I could go on and on and say the same thing about West Virginia's 
coal miners, steel workers, loggers, and chemical plant workers all of 
whom are truly the hardest working, finest people you ever spend time 
with. I know because I have.

West Virginia is my home and I am proud of that. I feel genuinely 
blessed to have been able to serve the people of West Virginia for as 
long as I have. West Virginia Day has always been a day resonating 
deeply inside of me and my fellow West Virginians. Happy 144th Birthday 
West Virginia! I ask that you, my distinguished colleagues join us in 
our celebration.
