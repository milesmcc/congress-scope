Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Maybe you could stick around and we can talk a 
little more about that supplemental and the slow-bleed policy.

I recall the comment that was made just a little earlier, Madam 
Speaker, by a friend on the other side of the aisle where she was 
quoting a general saying there was ''no military solution'' in Iraq. 
And, in fact, that is true. There is no isolated military solution. But 
that doesn't mean that the military doesn't have a role because it is a 
three-pronged strategy, which is military, economic, and political. And 
we are striving in all those areas to make certain that that area of 
the world is much more stable and much more secure so that we are much 
more stable and much more secure.

With that I am pleased to welcome my good friend Virginia Foxx from 
North Carolina. I thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to 
your perspective and your conversation on this issue.

I yield to the gentlewoman.
