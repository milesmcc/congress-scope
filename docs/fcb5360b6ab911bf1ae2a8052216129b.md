Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Fulfillment of the commission's 
congressional mandate requires the convening of public hearings and 
briefings as well as sustained engagement with visiting delegations of 
senior foreign government officials, including parliamentarians and 
representatives of nongovernmental organizations. When Congress 
established the commission, there were 35 countries that were part of 
the Helsinki Process. Today that number has grown to 56. Additionally, 
the commission has paid increasing attention to developments in OSCE 
partner countries, including Afghanistan, Egypt,


Jordan, and Israel, among others. The commission's increased workload 
has led to an increased number of public events as well as meetings 
with foreign dignitaries.
