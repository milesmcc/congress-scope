Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Can I share a story with you? I know I have 
shared this with you before, but I think it's worth repeating.

Right before we debated the Iraq war resolution a couple of weeks 
ago, I took the opportunity to go to Walter Reed and visit our wounded 
soldiers, had a chance to meet with six or eight of the finest young 
men that I have ever encountered. One of them was a young man who 
suffered from an inexplicable illness and was recovering at Walter 
Reed.

When I met him, his wife and his 6 year-old little boy were there. 
The gentleman explained to me that he had been in the middle of his 
third tour of duty, and he had a 6 year-old little boy. Each tour was 1 
year, 1 year.

Now, if you do the math, that means that he missed half of his little 
boy's life. The overwhelming sadness that came over me was almost too 
much to bear. I mean, this little boy was so sweet, his wife was so 
understanding, they were so committed to his dad's service, her 
husband's service. The little boy said to me, just spontaneously, you 
know, as 6 year-old little boys are, I have a 7 year-old little boy so 
I know, he spontaneously burst out, he knew his dad was supposed to 
finish his tour in August, and he was going to come home forever in 
August. We forget this is about families and people, and we are 
destroying the fabric of these families.
