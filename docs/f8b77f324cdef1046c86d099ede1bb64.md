Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, the majority of Americans do not support the 
President on Iraq. Yet he persists.

Our caucus is united in our desire to end this war and bring our 
troops home safely despite our genuine disagreements as to how and when 
to bring this about. Within this disagreement, we reflect the broad 
spectrum of opinion in our country. Yet, as Members of Congress, we 
must take action to change the trajectory of this war, to come closer 
to the goal of ending the war.

By setting deadlines for the President to meet his own articulated 
benchmarks, this bill places us firmly on that path.

This bill is not perfect. There will be ''no'' votes because there 
are deadlines and ''no'' votes because the deadlines are too distant. 
The ''perfect'' bill that all of us can support will not materialize 
and we will be no closer to ending this war.

At the same time, until their safe return, we must support our troops 
and provide them with the equipment and protective gear they need while 
they are in harm's way.

With this bill, Congress for the first time since the war began is 
not handing the President a blank check or rubber stamping his failed 
conduct of this war.

I strongly urge passage of this bill.
