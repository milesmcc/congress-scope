Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a Nebraskan who will be laid to rest tomorrow--a brave soldier who paid 
the ultimate price defending our freedoms and liberties.

2LT Mark Noziska, 24, a member of Company D, 1st Battalion, 22nd 
Infantry was taken from us by a roadside bomb while on patrol in 
Afghanistan.

Mark joined the Army after graduating with a Bachelor of Science 
degree from the University of Nebraska-Omaha. He was a true friend to 
those who knew him--a man full of life and someone who always had a 
smile. He loved his country and felt it was his duty to protect those 
dearest to him.

In a way, it is fitting we pay our respects to Mark on a day we 
observe the signing of our Constitution. The ideals and freedoms which 
we so often take for granted have been protected by young men such as 
Mark and his brothers and sisters in arms for generations. The words 
which define our country--written so long ago--are his legacy for us 
all.

My heart and prayers are with Mark's family during this difficult 
time. Words cannot express the depth of their loss--nor can they convey 
the debt our country owes this brave man. We can do no less than live 
up to his ideals.
