Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am going to make even briefer remarks 
than the Senator from Massachusetts did.

One of the questions I had been asked over the weekend was: Why 
hasn't the President already vetoed the supplemental appropriations 
bill? He promised he would veto the bill because it has all this extra 
spending in it, with directions on the war from people who really are 
not even involved in administering the war.

Of course, what I found out is the bill has not even been sent to the 
President yet. He cannot veto a bill until he receives a bill. So to 
chastise him for not having already vetoed the bill when there is a 
hold card keeping him from being able to veto the bill I think is 
unconscionable. Hanging on to that bill and not getting it there so the 
decisions can be made on it one way or the other just is not right. 
That is not the way to run the Senate. It is not the way to run the 
country. And it is not the President's fault if he does not have the 
bill to make the decision.

There can be a lot of debate on what that decision ought to be made 
and how to carry them out. I am certain the President will veto the 
bill; he has been very clear on that. There is a differing philosophy 
on how a war ought to be run. There are a lot of people throwing in the 
towel. It is kind of hard to win at anything if your opponent knows the 
point at which you are going to give up.

That is where we are in this battle, with the complete direction to 
give up, to throw in the towel, to say what has been done over there 
has not done any good, won't do any good, and to keep calling it a 
civil war. It is not a civil war. It is a religious war that is 
brewing. There is a tremendous difference. It is a religious war that 
involves the entire Middle East, not just Iraq. And in preparation, for 
what the other people in the Middle East have heard said on the Senate 
floor, armies are gearing up in Saudi Arabia and Syria and Israel and 
Iran, ready to move into the vacuum that would be caused by a U.S. 
departure.

That will not be the first time there has been a religious war in the 
world. If we do not step in, it would probably be the first time we had 
the chance to stop a religious war and did not help.


So we could leave, have a regional religious war, and then try to 
decide what we are going to do about that.

Religious wars are not easy things to solve. We have seen that with 
Kosovo with religious genocide. We got to see what happened in Kosovo. 
We helped out in Kosovo just as we are helping in Iraq.

So, Madam President, I hope we would actually debate the Food and 
Drug Administration bill, which is what we were set out to do this 
week. I hope people who have amendments would bring the amendments to 
the floor.
