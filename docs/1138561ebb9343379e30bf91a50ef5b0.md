Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to LTC Paul J. 
Finken who has given his life for his country while serving in Iraq. He 
was 40 years old. Paul Finken was raised in Earling, IA, and I know all 
Iowans share my pride as we also mourn his loss. As a career Army 
officer, Lieutenant Colonel Finken had dedicated his life to the 
service of his country and we can never thank him enough for his 
service and his final sacrifice on behalf of our freedom.

In remembering Paul Finken, his family said, ''Paul was a devoted 
husband, loving father and respected leader. He loved being a soldier 
and respected the soldiers he worked with. He always set the example 
and would never ask his soldiers to do anything he wouldn't do himself. 
He will be greatly missed by his family and by all who knew him.'' My 
thoughts and prayers are with his wife Jackie and his three daughters, 
Emilie, Caroline, and Julia, for their loss. I hope it will be of some 
comfort to them to know that Paul died a hero.
