Mr. ROSS. Again, these views on Iraq are not necessarily those of the 
Blue Dog Coalition. We require a two-thirds vote for an endorsed 
position. These are our views, those of us that believe we need a new 
direction and how we think we can get there in a bipartisan way.

Another one of the bills being put forth by the Blue Dogs, and this 
one was written by Heath Shuler from North Carolina, Charlie Melancon 
from Louisiana, and Charlie Wilson from Ohio, and it's called a 
Resolution Strengthening the Budget Process. It strengthens and 
increases transparency of the budget process. It ensures that Members 
have a sufficient amount of time to properly examine legislation and 
determine its actual cost. No more of being forced to vote on these 
300- and 400-page bills after seeing them for 15 minutes and knowing 
the cost of what we are voting on. PAYGO rules now require that.

It requires that a full Congressional Budget Office, CBO, cost 
estimate accompany any bill or conference report that comes to the 
House floor and ensures that lawmakers have at least 3 days to review 
the final text of any bill before casting their votes.

We can't make Members of Congress read the bills they are voting on; 
but if you give them 3 days from the final text to the day of the vote, 
it gives them the opportunity to read them. Right now, and many times 
under the Republican-led Congress in the past 6 years, there wasn't an 
opportunity to read the bills because they would let us see the bills 
15 minutes or an hour before we were voting on them, sometimes 300- and 
400-page bills.

Commonsense ideas that we are putting into legislation.

Another integral part of the Blue Dog fiscal accountability package 
is this, and I have done my best to go through it and explain to you 
what it is that we are trying to do there. It's a resolution aimed at 
strengthening and increasing the transparency of the budget process. 
All too often Members of Congress are forced to vote on legislation 
without knowing its true cost implications. This measure will ensure 
that Members have a sufficient amount of time to properly examine 
legislation and determine its actual cost.

And then, finally, the balanced budget amendment. And I want to thank 
the Blue Dog leader Kirsten Gillibrand from New York for authoring the 
balanced budget amendment, which would provide for a constitutional 
amendment requiring Congress to balance the Federal budget every year. 
Forty-nine States do it. Most American families do it. And it is time 
that the United States Congress did it. It allows for flexibility 
during times of war, natural disaster, or an economic downturn, and it 
prohibits cuts in Social Security benefits from ever being used in 
order to balance the budget.

Mr. Speaker, these are just three pieces of legislation that have 
been endorsed by the Blue Dog Coalition, authored by the members of the 
Blue Dog Coalition, that we believe can put us on a path toward 
restoring common sense, fiscal discipline, and accountability to our 
Nation's government.
