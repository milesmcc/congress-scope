`Mr. BOND â€” 11 September 2008`

---


Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join my colleagues and all Americans in 
solemn observance of the loss of 3,000 American lives on September 11, 
2001, truly the greatest tragedy on American soil in our recent 
history. Our thoughts and prayers are with these victims and their 
families.

We all know that al-Qaida terrorists declared war on the United 
States 7 years ago today. These vicious attacks claimed American lives 
and brought great concern and destruction across our country. While 
America has remained safe from another attack on our soil since 9/11/
2001, it is by no accident.

It is fitting that as we observe the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 
al-Qaida attacks, al-Qaida has been dealt a significant defeat in Iraq, 
both tactically and most certainly morally. It has been handed such a 
defeat in what its own leaders claim was the central front in the war 
against the United States. This victory was achieved at the hands of 
our brave troops and the people of Iraq.

As the result of new leadership under General Petraeus, his 
counterinsurgency strategy, and the surge, we are seeing our troops 
come home on success, including my son Sam, a marine who served two 
tours in Iraq. I heard about the success from the troops on the ground 
in my visits to Iraq, and our military leaders testified about this 
success before Congress, but now even the New York Times and Washington 
Post are writing about our return on success.

Look at some of the facts:

Anbar Province, once considered lost, has now been reclaimed by the 
Iraqi people. Not just in Anbar, but across the country, the Iraqis are 
leading operations to seek out al-Qaida--from Mosul to the Diyala 
Province. Across Iraq, violence is at its lowest point since the spring 
of 2004, and civilian deaths, sectarian killings, and suicide bombings 
are all down. For the Iraqi people, life is returning to normal. 
Markets are open and thriving, students are going to school--including 
girls, for the first time--and professionals are returning to work in 
Iraq. This win in Iraq is not only critical to the Middle East, but it 
is critical to our own Nation's security.

Defeat in Iraq would have given the terrorists who launched the 9/11 
attacks a safe haven to exploit terror worldwide. It is fitting that on 
this day we honor the memory of the victims of 9/11 and their families, 
that we take a moment to thank our troops fighting the al-Qaida 
terrorists in Iraq.

Our troops fought in Iraq so that future generations of Americans 
will not have to fight them on our own soil. I am proud of these brave 
men and women who sacrificed so much in defense of freedom and security 
here at home. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid.

Our troops are also fighting the terrorists in Afghanistan. Troop 
increases are now making a difference. But it will also take smart 
power, a careful blend of kinetic and nonkinetic power of the United 
States and its allies to defeat the terrorists in Afghanistan and 
elsewhere; efforts to build institutions in education, rule of law, 
infrastructure development, roads and power; efforts such as our 
Missouri National Guards's agriculture development teams. These teams 
are training the Afghanis in sustainable agriculture methods and 
techniques that will help them build a more secure and stable society.

It is critical that Pakistan continue to partner with the United 
States in defeating the terrorists who plague Afghanistan. The Taliban 
and other terror fighters hide in Pakistan's remote borders. We all 
hope that the country's newly elected democratic leaders will seek out 
and destroy these terrorists, not only for the security of their 
country but to prevent the terrorists from gaining a haven to plot and 
carry out attacks on America and our allies.

As we thank our troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, killing the 
terrorists before they can attack the homeland, we also thank the many 
patriots who fight unseen and unheard to keep our Nation safe. As the 
vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know all too well 
the dangers facing us.

I also know that in addition to our troops, our intelligence 
operators are on the front lines of the war on terror. Our intelligence 
officers and law enforcement efforts work tirelessly to stop attacks 
before they happen. We all owe the brave Americans who work to keep us 
safe, and the firefighters and first responders who come to our aid 
when disaster strikes.

In Congress, it is our job to ensure the intelligence community has 
the tools it needs to detect, disrupt, and prevent attacks on America, 
our troops, and our allies, which is why it is important that here in 
Congress we never forget the critical lessons of September 11--that our 
intelligence proved inadequate to stop the mass murder of innocent 
Americans on our own soil.

As we honor these lives lost, we must continue to work to improve our 
intelligence capabilities to keep a similar tragedy from ever happening 
again. Since 9/11 we have strived to strengthen our intelligence. My 
proudest accomplishment in 22 years in the Senate was the passage of 
the bipartisan Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--our Nation's 
early warning system to alert us of attacks. It was a long fight, but 
we now have a terrorist surveillance law that allows our intelligence 
operators to listen in on foreign terrorists.

We have also made other important changes in our laws and priorities 
related to the threat of international terrorism, such as the USA 
PATRIOT Act, intelligence reform measures, and implementing 
recommendations of the
9/11 Commission Act. But Congress has not done enough.

On the seventh anniversary of 9/11, it is noteworthy that there 
remains one unaddressed 9/11 commission recommendation, and that is to 
reform the legislative branch's oversight of intelligence and terrorism 
activities which the commission rightly described as ''dysfunctional.''

The 9/11 Commission stated:




 Of all of our recommendations, strengthening congressional 


 oversight may be among the most difficult and important.


Yet here we are 7 years after 9/11 and 4 years past the issuance of 
the 9/11 commission report, and that most significant recommendation 
for change remains unaddressed. The Senate tinkered around the edges by 
adding term


limits for Intelligence Committee members, but it has not addressed the 
fundamental structural dysfunction regarding the fiscal oversight of 
the intelligence.

The 9/11 commission made two bold recommendations to fix the problem: 
either consolidate authorization and appropriation functions into a 
single committee in both Houses or create a bicameral intelligence 
committee. Both of these approaches were considered and rejected by the 
Senate during consideration of S. Res. 445 in October of 2004. But many 
of us believe there is a better, less disruptive way to achieve reform 
through a carefully constructive intelligence appropriations 
subcommittee.

This approach was endorsed earlier this year by all but 1 of 15 
members of the Intelligence Committee in a letter sent to the majority 
and minority leaders along with an endorsement from the chairman and 
ranking member of the Homeland and Government Affairs Committee.

I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at 
this time.
