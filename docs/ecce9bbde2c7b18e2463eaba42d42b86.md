Public relations projects. He has represented the Navy and Marine Corp 
color guard at New York's Annual Fleet Week celebration and Boston's 
Bunker Hill Day, as well as at the 2005 National Scout Jamboree held at 
Fort A.P. Hill. Kevin and the USS Shreveport also brought humanitarian 
aid to hurricane Katrina victims and help established the Joint Task

Madam Speaker, it is soldiers like Kevin Mills who volunteer to 
protect the freedoms that all Americans hold dear to their hearts. 
While brave men and women like Kevin serve in the name of freedom and 
liberty, his family, friends, and loved ones should know that this 
Congress will never forget his sacrifice and commitment.
