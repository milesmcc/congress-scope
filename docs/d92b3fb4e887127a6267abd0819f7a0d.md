Mr. KUCINICH. A very simple proposition is facing this House; do we 
keep the war in Iraq going or do we end it? Do we use the money to 
bring the troops home or do we use the money to keep them in Iraq?

The lives of our troops are on the line. The war cannot be won 
militarily. Why do we stay? Why do we tell our troops to keep fighting? 
Who is going to explain to the families of the troops the consequences 
of Congress' decision? And why isn't our Democratic Party taking the 
leadership to immediately end the war? We can do it. We don't have to 
give the administration another $120 billion to keep the war going. We 
don't have to let more troops die and have more civilian casualties.

My bill, H.R. 1234, provides a path to bringing our troops home, 
ending the occupation, closing our bases and stops the occupation of 
Iraq. We do not have to keep funding this war. The money is in the 
pipeline to bring the troops home. Let's end the war, bring the troops 
home, and bring in international peacekeepers to stabilize Iraq. We can 
do it once we end the occupation.
