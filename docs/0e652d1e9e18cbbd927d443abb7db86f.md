Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate should have the opportunity 
to debate and amend this important bill. While the bill has many 
provisions I support, it also includes billions of dollars of earmarks 
and funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that will dig us 
deeper into debt without advancing our national security. I have a 
number of amendments to improve the bill, including one to require that 
future war funding be paid for, so it doesn't add to the deficit. I 
look forward to the opportunity to offer those amendments.
