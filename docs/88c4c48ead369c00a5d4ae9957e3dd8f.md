# JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION PROCESS
## `88c4c48ead369c00a5d4ae9957e3dd8f`
`Mr. SPECTER â€” 3 March 2008`

---


Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. The current presidential race 
provides the Senate with a unique opportunity to come to grips with the 
confirmation process of Federal judges and to make some very 
fundamental commitments and very fundamental changes to our process.

We are in the midst of a Presidential campaign, and I think it is 
fair to say the outcome is uncertain. It has fluctuated tremendously on 
both nomination pictures. But, this is a time, with the outcome 
uncertain, when neither side of the aisle would know who will gain an 
advantage; we would not know whose ox was being gored. It is a time, 
starting in the next Congress--if we can't act now, and my fundamental 
plea is that we act at the present time--we ought not to wait 11 
months, until January 20, 2009. This is a unique time to tackle the 
problem for the future.

On April 1, 2004, I offered S. Res. 327, and I now offer the 
substance of that resolution again. The whereas clauses of the 
resolution recited a distressing array of facts similar to what we have 
at the present time, with filibusters by the Democrats and with the 
retaliatory prospect of changing the filibuster rule. The resolution 
called for establishing a timetable for hearings of nominees for 
district courts and courts of appeal and the Supreme Court to occur 
within 30 days after the names of such nominees have been submitted to 
the Senate by the President and then to establish a timetable for 
action by the full committee within 30 days after the hearings and for 
reporting out nominees to the full Senate. And then to have a timetable 
for the full Senate to act within 90 days, with a provision for 
reasonable extension of times, upon agreement of the chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee and the ranking member or the majority leader and 
the minority leader to extend the time.

This resolution would establish procedures which would guarantee that 
the confirmation of judges would go back to the good old days, where 
you took a look at the person's academic credentials, you took a look 
at the person's professional background, you interviewed the 
individual, you had an FBI background check, and the person didn't have 
to pass some ideological purity test. Or, the individual did not have 
to pass a test such as what Judge Southwick was subjected to on this 
floor for months and months and months.

It was particularly egregious in the case of Judge Southwick. Judge 
Southwick was a distinguished Mississippi State appellate court judge. 
He was nominated for the Fifth Circuit, and he had an extraordinary 
record, more than 10 years on the State court bench--more than 70 
opinions. Objections were raised to two lines in two concurring 
opinions. Judge Southwick left the bench and went to Iraq and served 
for months in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. He was interviewed by 
many people of the Senate, and his confirmation hung on a thread until 
a courageous Senator from the other side of the aisle crossed party 
lines and led the way to get a few votes from the Democrats.

You don't have to be a profile in courage to support a judge such as 
Judge Southwick, and you don't have to be a profile in courage to 
support a nominee such as Rod Rosenstein or Peter Keisler or Robert 
Conrad or the others who were enumerated in my letter--some 10 circuit 
court judges and 18 district court judges.

I wish to quote a very respectable authority in my concluding 
comment. A man who has served in the Senate since he was elected from 
Vermont in 1974, twice chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and this is 
what the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, had to say 
on October 5, 2000.




 This year, the Judiciary Committee reported only three 


 nominees to the Court of Appeals all year.


This is the last year of President Clinton's administration.




 We denied a committee vote to two outstanding nominees who 


 succeeded in getting hearings. I hope we can look again and 


 ask ourselves objectively, without any partisanship: Can we 


 not do better on judges?


This is Senator Leahy. Going on.




 I quoted Governor George Bush--


He was in the campaign process at that time in the 2000 election. 
Senator Leahy says:




 I quoted Governor George Bush on the floor a couple of days 


 ago. I said I agreed with him. On nominations he said we 


 should vote them up or down within 60 days. If you don't want 


 the person, vote against them. The Republican Party should 


 have no fear of that. They have the majority in this body. 


 They could vote against them if they want, but have the vote. 


 Either vote for them or vote against them. Don't leave people 


 such as Helene White and Bonnie Campbell, people such as 


 this, just hanging forever without even getting a rollcall 


 vote. That is wrong. It is not a responsible way and 


 besmirches the Senate, this body, that I love so much.


Senator Leahy, you were right on October 5, 2000, and you are right 
on March 3, 2008.

I yield the floor.
















 Exhibit 1

























 Washington, DC,

























February 29, 2008.


 Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,


 Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate 




 Office Building, Washington, DC.



 Dear Patrick: I write in the hope that you and I can work 


 out an accommodation on the confirmation of federal judges 


 without our respective caucuses coming to an impasse. Without 


 going into an elaborate history on the confirmation of 


 federal judges, the essence of the situation is that 15 


 circuit judges and 57 district court judges were confirmed in 


 the last two years of President Clinton's Administration, 


 compared to 6 circuit court and 34 district court judges for 


 President Bush in 2007-2008. That means there must be 


 confirmations or at least up-or-down votes on 9 additional 


 circuit and 23 district court judges to equal President 


 Clinton's record.



 President Bush is even farther behind President Clinton in 


 total confirmations when contrasting their entire terms, 


 since President Clinton confirmed 65 circuit court and 305 


 district court judges while President Bush has so far 


 confirmed only 57 circuit and 237 district court judges. In 


 addition, thus far in the 110th Congress, only 5 of President 


 Bush's circuit court nominees have been granted hearings. By 


 this date in President Clinton's final two years in office, 


 the Committee had held hearings for 10 circuit court 


 nominees. Until the hearing for Ms. Catharina Haynes on 


 February 21, 2008, we had not had a circuit court hearing 


 since September 25, 2007, some 5 months ago.



 While there have been many hotly contested issues in the 


 Senate in recent years, the most bitter controversies have 


 involved federal judicial nominations. In 2005, the battle 


 over judges reached a high point, or low point, with the 


 Republican caucus threatening to employ the ''nuclear 


 option'' to combat the Democrats' filibusters. In my 


 judgment, in the past twenty years, there has been a great 


 deal of blame split evenly between both sides.



 As the record shows, I dissented from the Republican 


 caucus's position by casting key votes in favor of several 


 circuit court nominees, including controversial nominees such 


 as Judge Marsha Berzon, who was confirmed to the Ninth 


 Circuit Court of Appeals on March 9, 2000, Judge Timothy Dyk, 


 who was confirmed to the Federal Circuit on May 24, 2000, 


 Judge Richard Paez, who was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit on 


 March 9, 2000, and Judge H. Lee Sarokin, who was confirmed to 


 the Third Circuit on October 4, 1994. Similarly, I supported 


 President Clinton's nomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who was 


 confirmed to the District Court for the Southern District of 


 New York by a vote of 63-36 on May 24, 2000. I also supported 


 other controversial non-judicial confirmations such as Lani 


 Guinier to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights 


 Division of the justice Department and the subsequent 


 nomination of Bill Lann Lee for the same position.



 Now I believe that my caucus is correct in insisting on up-


 or-down votes on nominees with extraordinary records, 


 including several who are nominated to fill seats deemed 


 judicial emergencies. A listing of these nominees with their 


 superb qualifications proves the point:

 Two editorials in the Washington Post urged Senate

 It is my hope that we can work together to ensure that all 


 of these nominees receive timely hearings and prompt votes in 


 the Committee.



 In light of my extensive consultation with you in 


 scheduling the hearings for Chief Justice Roberts and Justice 


 Alito, as well as our collaboration on numerous other 


 Committee hearings, I was surprised when you scheduled a 


 hearing for Judge Catharina Haynes on February 21st during 


 the recess. I know you offered to postpone that hearing for a 


 relatively brief period of time, but a formal, written 


 request for a postponement would only have provided more 


 grist for the argument mill on these issues. I was prepared 


 to cancel my previously scheduled work in Pennsylvania to 


 attend the Haynes hearing until Senator John Warner, who was 


 in Washington, agreed to attend.



 Given the uncertainty of who the next President will be, 


 now would be a good time to change the confirmation process 


 to guarantee prompt action on nominees with up-or-down votes. 


 I again urge you to work for me to establish a schedule for 


 prompt consideration of all currently pending judicial 


 nominees and ensure they receive up-or-down votes in 


 Committee and on the Senate floor. I have shared this letter 


 with the other Republican members of the Committee.





 Sincerely,


























Arlen Specter.
