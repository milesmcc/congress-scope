`Mr. CARPER â€” 15 April 2010`

Mr. CARPER. I see Senator McCain is on the floor, and if I am reading 
his body language right, it looks like he wants to say something about 
our visit to Afghanistan and to Pakistan last week. I don't know if he 
wants to be a part of this colloquy or if he wants us to get out of his 
way so he can talk about something else, but I yield to the Senator 
from Arizona.
