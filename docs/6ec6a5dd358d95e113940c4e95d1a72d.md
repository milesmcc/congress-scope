Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of 
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and his diplomatic career which lasted the 
better part of five decades. Ambassador Holbrooke's decorated career 
spanned the globe from Asia to Europe with stops at the U.S. State 
Department, United Nations, and most recently, as Presidential envoy on 
Afghanistan-Pakistan policy. His service shaped American foreign policy 
in such troubled areas as the Balkans and most recently in leading the 
U.S. in Afghanistan. I concur with the sentiments of many of my 
colleagues in that his stellar service is deeply appreciated and held 
in the highest esteem. As co-chair of the Afghanistan Caucus, I 
especially appreciate his promotion of a civil, democratic society for 
the people of Afghanistan. Ambassador Holbrooke will be deeply missed.

I would like to express my condolences to his wife, Kati, his two 
sons, and two stepchildren along with the rest of the Holbrooke family. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time.
