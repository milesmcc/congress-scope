Mr. SALAZAR. I come to the floor today with my distinguished 
colleague and friend, the Senator from Tennessee, to talk about a new 
way forward in Iraq. I ask unanimous consent that legislation which we 
have put together working with the Iraq Study Group entitled, The Iraq 
Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007, be printed in 
the Record.
