Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, when I heard that the President vetoed 
this bill today, I asked to speak.

After about three-and-a-half decades in the U.S. military, I owe both 
Republicans and Democrats a lot. About 2, 2/1/2/ years, little over 2 
years ago, my daughter, 4 years old, was struck with a malignant brain 
tumor. I'd never had a personal challenge in my entire life, having 
only gotten married 9 years ago. I'd had a lot of professional ones, 
but after three brain operations, chemotherapy and radiation, she's 
here today. I thank you all for that because I had the best health care 
plan in America.

We took a pathology slice at Johns Hopkins, Mass General's Hospital. 
We took it everywhere. We took it to the ends of the Earth, and you 
gave me that health care plan.

But I will never forget living in Children's Hospital oncology ward 
down the street, and there was a young 2/1/2/-year-old boy the day my 
daughter started chemotherapy after her brain operations, and for 6 
hours my wife and I could not help but overhear, because you all have 
been in those hospital rooms, social workers come and go to talk to the 
parents of the young 2/1/2/-year-old boy from Washington, DC, who had 
been diagnosed with acute leukemia that morning, to see whether that 
young boy could stay and have the same opportunity my daughter had 
because of you.

So this is the reason I got into the race for Congress a little less 
than 2 years ago. I owed you. I owed this Nation. You gave me an 
opportunity to have my daughter be here today. I didn't get in for 
Iraq. I got in for this bill. While it may not be perfect, neither was 
TRICARE, and I would just ask everyone to truly think about the 
opportunity to give our children, every child, this young boy, the same 
opportunity you gave me and my daughter.
