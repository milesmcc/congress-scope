# POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE DOESN'T CUT IT

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, yesterday Democrat 
leaders staged a ceremony to send their defeatist supplemental bill to 
President Bush. As Democrats joined together around their proposal of 
retreat, our troops in Baghdad waited yet another day for critical 
funding.

The sad irony is that for all of their pomp and circumstance, 
Democrat leaders should face the threat of al-Qaeda, in that Zawahiri 
has declared Iraq the central front in the Global War on Terrorism. We 
should be working together in the Global War on Terrorism, not promote 
plans of defeat. We need to be on the offense protecting American 
families.

Fortunately, President Bush vetoed the Democrat plan for defeat last 
night. I look forward to voting to uphold this veto and am hopeful we 
can now get down to the business of providing for our troops. We must 
face the terrorists overseas or we will face them again in the streets 
of America.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th.
