Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 1Lt. Jonathan W. Edds of White 
Pigeon, MI, was killed during an lED attack in Baghdad, Iraq, on August 
17, 2007. Jonathan was assigned to the Headquarters Company, 2nd 
Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division based in Fort 
Benning, GA. First Lieutenant Edds and his wife Laura resided in Phenix 
City, AL.

Words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family and 
the gratitude our country feels for his service. First Lieutenant Edds, 
like other brave men and women who have served in uniform, died serving 
not just the United States, but the entire cause of liberty. Indeed, 
like those who have served before him, he was a true American.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve our Nation. Thank


you, Madam Speaker, for the House's remembrance at this mournful 
occasion.
