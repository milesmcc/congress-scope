Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Ryan C. 
Crocker to be Ambassador to Iraq. This was reported out of the Foreign 
Relations Committee earlier today. I ask unanimous consent that the 
nomination be confirmed, a motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, 
that any statements be printed at the appropriate place in the Record, 
the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that 
the Senate return to legislative session.
