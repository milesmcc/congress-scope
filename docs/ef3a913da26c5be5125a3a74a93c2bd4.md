`Mr. POE â€” 5 March 2008`

---


Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in the Dark Ages, King Henry VIII left the 
Catholic church because it would not permit his multiple marriages. 
Well, Britain is heading back to the Dark Ages. The more wives a 
British male has, the more benefits he will receive under welfare. This 
new policy will really only benefit Muslim extremist men, who keep a 
harem of 4 wives.

The Archbishop of Canterbury suggested that Britain appease Muslim 
extremists so that they would not have to choose loyalty between Islam 
and Britain. Tell this to the British soldiers, who are fighting Muslim 
extremists in Iraq, while their own government rewards Muslim 
extremists at home. It seems that the real extremists are Britain's own 
leaders, who have gone too far in the name of political correctness.

Religious law cannot overrule the law of the land. We cannot make 
exceptions to appease an individual group.

The great Winston Churchill once said, ''Never give in, never . . . 
never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.'' I'm sure 
Winston Churchill is turning in his grave.

And that's just the way it is.
