Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in the United States, we have an incredible 
history, especially when it comes to our Armed Forces. Today, I want to 
recognize one of Houston's own, the 147th Fighter Wing/111th Fighter 
Squadron Texas Air National Guard out of Ellington Field, Texas. Their 
distinguished accomplishments during times of war and peace have made 
them well-known not only in Texas, but across the globe.

The 111th Aero Squadron met its beginnings at Kelly Field on Aug. 14, 
1917. However, it was not until June 29, 1923, that the Squadron moved 
to its current location, Ellington Field. During the same year, they 
were designated a part of the Texas National Guard under the title of 
the 111th Observation Squadron, 36th Division.

Their emblem, which is one of the oldest in the United States Air 
Force, known as the Ace-In-The-Hole, signifies their interconnectedness 
to the State of Texas. Its immortal stance in Texas culture results 
from the grandfathering of the insignia at its inception. This motion 
works to prevent any future alteration to the historical design.

On Sept. 25, 1940, as the country was on the brink of World War II, 
the 111th became part of the federal war effort. Soon thereafter, the 
Squadron was reintroduced as part of the 68th Observation Group.



Following a short assignment protecting the U.S. border, they began 
preparations for overseas combat. During the war, their initial 
deployments led the Squadron to the Algerian beaches, in Operation 
Torch. In 1943, the 111th was chosen to take part in the Tunisian 
Campaign of the Army's II Corps. Later, assigned to the 7th Army in 
Sicily, they served as the aerial support to allied troops until the 
end of the war.

Respectably, this famed crew flew 3,840 missions from 1943 to 1945. 
While serving as the eyes of the military, they destroyed 44 enemy 
aircraft, damaged 20 and had 12 probable kills. Because of their valor, 
the 111th received eight Battle Stars, the Presidential Unit Citation 
as well as recognitions from the French Government.

In December 1945, they returned to Texas as the 111th Fighter 
Squadron. On Oct. 10, 1950, the 111th returned to battle for the Korean 
War. Throughout this 22-month theater, they became attached to the 
136th Fighter Group. The Squadron again performed gallantly and 
destroyed 1,343 railroad cars, 1,943 buildings, 88 bridges, 126 gun 
emplacements, 89 boats, 2 MIG-15 fighters and participated in 
activities that resulted in 5,578 enemy troop casualties.

When foreign disagreements subsided, they were assigned to Air 
Defense Command on U.S. soil. Later, pilots from the Fighter Wing 
provided aerial support for American troops during the Vietnam Conflict 
from 1968-1970.

Following the events of September 11, 2001, the newly renamed 147th 
escorted President George W. Bush and his father onboard Air Force One 
back to Washington, DC. Later that year, they were deployed within the 
United States in support of Operation Noble Eagle.


The 147th was deployed in 2005 for Operation Iraqi Freedom and the 
Global War on Terror. Continuing the Squadron's noted performance 
during previous conflicts, pilots of the Fighter Wing flew 462 sorties, 
with 100 percent maintenance delivery, 100 percent mission 
effectiveness along with 100 percent weapons employment hits while 
under extremely challenging combat conditions.

Although the list of overseas wartime accomplishments for the 111th 
are many, so is the impact and assistance provided by the same men and 
women on a national level to local issues. Since 1989 the Fighter Wing 
pilots have utilized the C-26 Merlin to conduct counter-drug law 
enforcement missions throughout the area. Most recently, in response to 
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Squadron came to aid those in this 
area who needed it most. These fine Americans have and continue to 
provide tremendous service to the United States, the State of Texas and 
to the communities surrounding Ellington Field.

I am proud to recognize the many accomplishments of this great group 
of Texas patriots. On the 90th anniversary, I would like to recognize 
these brave men and women for their service to the United States. I am 
also privileged to have served at Ellington Field in the United States 
Air Force Reserve, 704th TAS, 924th Troop Carrier Group, 446th Troop 
Carrier Wing from 1970-1976.

And that's just the way it is.
