Mr. POLIS. Well, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota. And people 
know, taxes are relative to one's income. I've heard from many people, 
and of course in this recession people are hurting across the board 
from the wealthy to the poor. And I think even those who pay the 
highest rate of tax, many of them would say, you know, I would gladly 
pay the tax rate we had in the Clinton administration if I had the 
income that we had through the nineties.

What you pay is relative to how much you earn. Currently, the highest 
marginal rate at 35 percent, with the expiration of the Bush tax cuts 
will return to 39.6 percent. That's the same rate it was when people 
were doing very well during the boom years.

Taxes are the investment. They're the price that we pay for the 
freedoms that we enjoy in our country. They're what fund our public 
projects and, yes, worthy and unworthy. I, as a taxpayer, wasn't happy 
that my taxes were going to fund the Iraq war, and continue to. But 
that's what our representative system is all about.

And I know there's many Americans out there today who weren't happy 
that their taxes might go to help provide health care for those who 
can't afford it. But the fact is, it's the price we pay for the 
freedoms that we enjoy as Americans, and we enjoy more freedoms as 
Americans than people anywhere else in the world.

The noble experiment that was begun by our Founding Fathers over two 
centuries ago has evolved over the years and become something that 
every one of them would be proud of having given birth to.

We invest in many public projects. You know, in the nature of a 
democracy, each and every citizen, in fact, each and every Member of 
Congress is not likely to agree with every item that's spent. I know I 
don't. I voted ''no'' on some. I know my colleague from Minnesota voted 
''no'' on some. Our colleagues and friends on the other side of the 
aisle voted against some of those. But this is a representative 
democracy.

We here in Congress, each serving and being elected by our 
constituents, are doing our best to allocate those dollars in a way to 
provide for the common good, the very concept that is conceptualized so 
effectively in our founding documents. That's what we do every day.

And this being tax time, everybody is reminded of how much they have 
to pay. And I think it's also important for us to remind them how much 
they get, the fact that people all over the world would risk dying, 
going across the desert to try to live in our country, what America 
stands for, globally, in terms of freedom, of unprecedented levels of 
prosperity that our middle-class families enjoy. That's what the 
American Dream is all about. That's what our country is all about.

And, no, it's not just the government that establishes this dream. 
But what it is is it's the rule of law, and it's a government formed 
among men governing by the consent of the governed to provide for the 
common good. We won't always get it right. But that's the investment 
that we're making when we pay taxes.

And even though I opposed the Iraq war and didn't like to see my tax 
dollars go there, even though I continue to oppose the escalation of 
troops in Afghanistan, and don't want to see my tax dollars going 
there, I know that the investment I make in paying my taxes is one that 
I can be proud of as an American. Knowing that it goes through title I 
to serve schools across our country that serve at-risk youth; knowing 
that it goes to help make health care more affordable for American 
families; knowing that it goes to help so that people who are 
unemployed don't lose their homes, can still put food on the table for 
their families; to know that our seniors have health care; to know that 
our young people have health care, and we're making it more accessible 
for people in the middle; to know that we're funding our roads, our 
bridges, our infrastructure, our arteries of commerce that empower the 
private sector to produce the prosperity that has made America unique--
that's what it means to pay taxes.

That's why every year, in April, when I pay mine, I feel that same 
lump in my throat and in my belly as every American; but I know, deep 
inside, that I would not trade it for anything else. And I am proud 
that I have this opportunity to be able to contribute to this greatest 
of the great countries and help America continue to be a beacon unto 
the nations and a light for future generations.

I thank the gentleman from Minnesota.
