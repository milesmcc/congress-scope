# EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS
## `550fa1eeebcf3903ddfe44db119aeb83`
`Mr. CONRAD â€” 24 May 2007`

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise tonight in support of the 
supplemental.

I opposed the authorization to go to war in Iraq because I thought it 
would be a tragic error, and it has proved to be. Iraq did not attack 
this country; al-Qaida did. Sometimes I think that is somehow lost in 
this discussion. It was al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden, not Iraq, led 
by Saddam Hussein, who masterminded the attacks of September 11. That 
is a fact. That is a reality. I think it was one of the great mistakes 
in American history that we launched an attack on Iraq before ever 
finishing business with al-Qaida.

Now we face a difficult choice. We have 160,000 troops in the field, 
and I believe we must fund those troops until there is a responsible 
plan to redeploy them. Unfortunately, this President has absolutely 
refused to construct such a plan. I believe that leaves us with little 
choice but to fund the troops in this resolution before us tonight.

We also have in this package a matter of great interest to the people 
whom I represent, so I would like to speak for just a moment on a 
separate subject; that is, the disaster relief which is contained in 
this legislation.

I introduced a comprehensive disaster plan 3 years ago. The Senate 
has supported it, most recently in a vote of 74 to 23 on the Senate 
floor. The House supported it 2 weeks ago in a vote of over 302 Members 
in support. Today, it received 348 votes. Now we have an assurance we 
did not have before--that the disaster package will be signed by 
President Bush. This has been a long, hard fight, but it is critically 
important to the people whom I represent.

These have been the headlines all across my State:




 Crops Lost To Flooding.



 Beet Crop Smallest in 10 Years.



 Heavy Rain Leads to Crop Diseases.



 Rain Halts Harvest.



 Area Farmers Battle Flooding and Disease.


This is the picture which we saw in my State 2 years ago. I flew over 
southeastern North Dakota, and it looked like a giant lake. Over a 
million acres were prevented from even being planted. Another million 
acres had tremendous losses in production.

Then, irony of ironies, last year we had one of the worst droughts in 
our Nation's history--by scientific measurement, the third worst 
drought in American history--and the Dakotas were the epicenter of that 
drought.

Mr. President, it got very little attention. It wasn't like 
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which were disasters that were immediately 
evident, and which received enormous national media attention. This was 
a slow-developing tragedy but a tragedy nonetheless. The Dakotas were 
right at the heart of it--North Dakota and South Dakota. It was rated 
as an exceptional drought--not extreme or severe or moderate, which are 
the other measurements, but an exceptional drought. Exceptional it was.

Here is the map of the U.S. Drought Monitor. They concluded it was 
the third worst drought in our Nation's history, right down the center 
of our country.

As you can see in this picture taken near my home in Burleigh County, 
ND, the corn is supposed to be knee-high by July 4, but it was just 
over the edge of this man's boot. I went into a cornfield that was 
irrigated. The farmer started shucking the corn, and every other row 
was empty. I asked him how can that be? He told me: Senator, this week 
it was 112 degrees one day. We had day after day where it was over 100 
degrees.

This led to a devastating series of losses. The bankers of my State 
came to me and said: If there is not help, 5 to 10 percent of our 
clients are going to be out of business. That is how serious and 
consequential this is. Without this help, thousands of farm and ranch 
families will be forced off the land.

This legislation is funded as an emergency and doesn't require 
offsets from other programs. This is a change from the 2004 agriculture 
disaster package. Producers will be eligible for assistance for one 
year only. Assistance payments plus the value of crop sales and crop 
insurance cannot exceed 95 percent of the expected crop value, so 
nobody is getting rich.

It doesn't allow producers to receive multiple benefits for the same 
loss. So there is no double-dipping.

Crop assistance eligibility requires a 35-percent loss before there 
is a dime of assistance, and the payment rate is 42 percent of the 
established price for insured crops.

Livestock producers are eligible for both a livestock compensation 
program to help offset forage losses and feed costs and a livestock 
indemnity program to help cover death losses.

I thank my colleagues in the Senate and the House who have worked 
tirelessly for the last 3 years to help deliver this assistance. It has 
been bipartisan in the Senate. It has been a long and hard fight, but 
it is going to be a lifeline to thousands of farm and ranch families in 
my State. This is a bill the President should sign.

I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
