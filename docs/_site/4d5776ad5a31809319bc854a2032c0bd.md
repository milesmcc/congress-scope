# NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008

`Mr. SPECTER â€” 26 September 2007`

---


Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to respond to 
the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, to 
eliminate the National Drug Intelligence Center, which is located in 
Johnstown, PA. That center was created in 1992 and performs a very 
important function. The National Drug Intelligence Center, commonly 
referred to as the NDIC, partners with the Department of Homeland 
Security and the Office of Counternarcotics Enforcement, to provide 
intelligence, to identify, track, and sever the nexus between drug 
trafficking and terrorism. The NDIC created an entity called 
HashKeeper, a company software program which is provided to the Federal 
Government for use in Iraq. The cost of this center is about one-third 
of what it would be if it were located in the Washington, DC, area.

I think it makes good sense to decentralize Federal functions to the 
extent it is possible and practical. Everything does not have to be 
located in Washington, DC. Everything does not have to be located in a 
big city. Our country is more vulnerable when everything is 
concentrated in one area. Johnstown has the advantage of being much 
less expensive, being able to provide these vital Federal services for 
about one-third of the cost, while being reasonably close to 
Washington, DC, which is the location of many of the other entities 
with which it cooperates.

The jobs which are provided are very substantial for my constituents 
in Pennsylvania; an obvious interest that I have as a Senator 
representing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These are several 
hundred jobs; they are very important. It is a legitimate interest to 
want to maintain our industrial base in Pennsylvania and to maintain 
governmental activities in Pennsylvania. But there is good value in 
having the NDIC function, in general, and there is extra good value in 
having it function in Johnstown, PA.

The NDIC has been complimented by a broad number of agencies. In a 
November 21, 2001, letter, the FBI praised the NDIC for its work on 
financial crimes, saying:




 Through the analysis of these documents, over 400 specific 


 intelligence products have been produced for the FBI, the 


 Department of Justice, the Department of Treasury, and U.S. 


 Attorney's Offices. The work NDIC produces continues to 


 initiate actionable leads and identify avenues of 


 investigation. NDIC has integrated seamlessly with the FBI 


 investigation and has enhanced the way the FBI will 


 investigate future financial cases. The participation of NDIC 


 . . . continues to be invaluable.





In a June 23, 2006, letter, the Drug Enforcement Agency had this to 
say:




 The Fort Worth Resident Office--

that is of DEA--



 amassed thousands of documents, but was unable to properly 


 exploit the information they contained. The valuable report--

referring to the NDIC report--



 caused several of the principals to negotiate pleas to 


 pending charges. If not for the willingness of the members of 


 NDIC to confront these challenges in a cooperative effort, 


 this investigation would not have reached its current level 


 of success.


There have been many plaudits given to the NDIC by the special agents 
in charge of FBI offices, such as the FBI agent in charge of the Tampa 
Field Division, the FBI special agent in charge of the Detroit Field 
Division, the DEA special agent in charge of the Dallas Field Division, 
the FBI special agent in charge of the Charlotte Division, and the DEA 
special agent in charge of the Oklahoma City District Office. This last 
is ironic, in a sense. In a March 25, 2006, DEA cable, the DEA Oklahoma 
City District Office had this to say.




 In support of phases one and two, NDIC deployed two teams 


 in Oklahoma, each consisting of one special agent, one 


 computer exploitation and five document exploitation 


 personnel. Actionable intelligence was generated and passed 


 to the appropriate DEA offices. The OKCDO thanks all NDIC 


 personnel--

that is the Oklahoma City District Office thanks all NDIC personnel--



 who planned and participated in this operation. The 


 intelligence and operational knowledge gained was beneficial 


 to OKCDO, and its law enforcement partners. . . .


President, National High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, HIDTA, 
Director's Association Executive Board: May 24, 2007, Letter to the 
Attorney General in support of NDIC:




 NDIC produced thirty-two HIDTA drug market analyses for the 


 HIDTA program. Production of the HIDTA drug market analyses 


 required a full-time effort of twenty-six analysts for 


 extended periods of time working side-by-side with the HIDTA 


 Intelligence Center personnel.



 NDIC is a very valuable asset in addressing the nation's 


 drug problem.



 This entire effort lead to a valuable working relationship 


 with not only the HIDTAs but federal, state and local drug 


 enforcement entities.


FBI Special Agent in Charge--Tampa Field Division: January 16, 2007, 
Letter of Appreciation for NDIC assistance.




 The purpose of this letter is to recognize the assistance 


 of the National Drug Intelligence Center's (NDIC) Document 


 and Computer Exploitation Branch for the superb analytical 


 support they provided the Violent Crimes/Gang Squad on an 


 investigation into the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation.


FBI Special Agent in Charge--Detroit Field Division: December 11, 
2006, Letter of Appreciation for NDIC:




 The teamwork displayed in working with investigators from 


 the DEA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is a true 


 measure of what can be accomplished when agencies work 


 together. NDIC's analysis of the [redacted] Pharmacy evidence 


 assisted in obtaining a sixty-two count indictment . . .


The FBI characterized NDIC's performance as exemplary in this letter.

DEA Special Agent in Charge--Dallas Field Division: June 23, 2006, 
Letter of Commendation for Document Exploitation support to a major 
drug investigation:




 The Fort Worth Resident Office (DEA) amassed thousands of 


 documents, but was unable to properly exploit the information 


 they contained. The valuable [NDIC] report listed the seized 


 documents and collated them, which created a valuable tool 


 for Investigators and Prosecutors in this investigation.



 In conclusion, this effort caused several of the principals 


 to negotiate pleas to pending charges.



 Subsequently, 19 search warrants and over 100 seizure 


 warrants were executed, which resulted in the seizure of 


 approximately $20 million, in assets.



 If not for the willingness of the members of NDIC to 


 confront these challenges in a cooperative effort, this 


 investigation would not have reached its current level of 


 success.


FBI Charlotte Division: May 2, 2006, Letter of Commendation for NDIC:




 In February 2006, your staff presented to the North 


 Carolina Law Enforcement Community, the most comprehensive 


 Intelligence Assessment ever conducted within the state of 


 North Carolina relating to gangs. I commend NDIC in exceeding 


 all expectations in providing this valuable assessment.


Executive Office of the President--ONDCP Director: April 17, 2006, 
Letter of Commendation regarding drug market collection effort:




 I want to express my thanks for NDIC's domestic market 


 collection effort.



 I know that this was a serious, time consuming undertaking 


 by your agency, and I truly appreciate the efforts of 


 everyone involved.



 Thanks for the hard work.


DEA Oklahoma City District Office: March 25, 2006, DEA cable:




 In support of phases one and two, NDIC deployed two teams 


 to Oklahoma, each consisting of one special agent, one 


 computer exploitation and five document exploitation 


 personnel.



 Actionable intelligence was generated and passed to the 


 appropriate DEA offices.



 The OKCDO thanks all NDIC personnel who planned and 


 participated in this operation. The intelligence and 


 operational knowledge gained was beneficial to the OKCDO and 


 its law enforcement partners in the state . . .


Executive Office of the President--ONDCP Assistant Deputy Director: 
March 13, 2006, E-mail of Appreciation for drug market collection 
effort:




 Please, convey our thanks to your staff for their 


 outstanding job on the ONDCP Market Collection Effort.



 Once Again, we greatly appreciate the superb support and 


 please pass on our thanks for a job well done!


U.S. Department of Justice--Assistant Attorney General: March 7, 
2006, Letter of Commendation regarding the National Drug Threat 
Assessment:




 In a letter to the Director of NDIC, the Assistant Attorney 


 General praised NDIC's National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA) 


 stating:



 The NDTA report is extremely helpful to me and prosecutors 


 who are charged with devising new and creative strategies to 


 achieve that goal.



 I know that you and your entire staff have put a tremendous 


 amount of work into creating the NDTA. I wanted to let you 


 know that the effort was well worth it.


U.S. Attorney--District of New Mexico: January 18, 2006, Letter of 
Praise for NDIC:




 I am writing to express my thanks for a job not just well 


 done, but rather for an extraordinary, and in my career, 


 unprecedented collaborative effort to support the federal 


 prosecution of significant drug traffickers and money 


 launders.



 Once again, thank you for allowing your amazing staff to 


 dedicate their time, skills and NDIC resources to this 


 important case. The work done in support of this case by NDIC 


 is invaluable. . .


U.S. Department of Treasury--Under Secretary, Office of Terrorism and 
Financial Intelligence: December 28, 2005, Letter of Appreciation for 
support in completing the national U.S. Money Laundering Threat 
Assessment:




 I am very pleased to inform you that the Money Laundering 


 Threat Assessment is complete.



 [I]t is thanks to active and substantial contributions by 


 the NDIC and the other participants.



 I can't thank you enough for the extraordinary 


 contribution.


Office of Counter Narcotics Enforcement/U.S. Interdiction 
Coordinator--Acting Director: September 7, 2005, Letter of Appreciation 
for support to a drug/terror tasking:




 As I am sure you are aware, NDIC is actively supporting the 


 expanded mission of the Office of Counter Narcotics 


 Enforcement (CNE) by aiding us in the response to the new 


 drug/terror nexus (DTX) tasking as assigned to my office in 


 the Intelligence Reform & Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. I 


 wanted to take this opportunity to let you know how much I 


 appreciate NDIC's support to this office and to our country's 


 overall counterdrug interdiction efforts.


FBI--Chief, Terrorist Financing Operations Section, TFOS: March 5, 
2003, Letter of Thanks for providing long term assistance to post-911 
investigations:




 As always, it is a pleasure to write to you, as it affords 


 those of us within the Terrorist Financing Operations Section 


 (TFOS) an opportunity to thank you for the continued 


 exceptional assistance NDIC provides to the Counterterrorism 


 Division here at FBI Headquarters.


FBI--Chief, Financial Crimes Section: November 21, 2001, Letter of 
Appreciation to Deputy Attorney General commending NDIC:




 Since 09/20/2001, the NDIC team, consisting of NDIC 


 Intelligence Analysts and FBI Financial Analysts, has 


 analyzed over 75,000 subpoenaed financial documents. Through 


 the analysis of these documents, over 400 specific 


 intelligence products have been produced for the FBI, the 


 Department of Justice, the Department of Treasury, and U.S. 


 Attorney's Office. The work NDIC produces continues to 


 initiate actionable leads and identify avenues of 


 investigation. NDIC has integrated seamlessly with the FBI 


 investigation and has enhanced the way the FBI will 


 investigate future financial cases. The participation NDIC in 


 this investigation continues to be invaluable.





In concluding--the two most popular words in any speech--I 
acknowledge and respect the work the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, 
is doing. He and I have worked very closely in his almost 3 years in 
the Senate. I observed his work in the House of Representatives, and I 
know his work as a medical professional. I understand what he is doing 
in subjecting to an analytical eye Federal expenditures. But I do not 
believe he should target the NDIC.

I concur that we ought to be holding down Federal expenditures, and I 
think that close scrutiny of all such projects is very much in the 
national interest. But I believe the facts are very strong in support 
of continued operation of the NDIC in Johnstown, PA.

I yield the floor.
