`Mrs. BLACKBURN â€” 1 May 2007`

Mrs. BLACKBURN. That is right. It is so unfortunate. What we need is 
a clean bill that allows a good debate over how we are moving forward 
in Iraq.

I think it has been striking to see the Senate confirm and give a 
vote of support for General David Petraeus who is commanding our 
efforts in Iraq, a very scholarly general. He truly is a leader for our 
men and women and for the Iraqis. He has great respect from them.

But then to turnaround and say we are going to second guess or Monday 
morning quarterback your decisions and we are not going to give the 
funding and we are not going to give it in a timely manner. As the 
gentleman from Georgia was so eloquently stating earlier, there comes a 
time when you have to look at it and talk about what their intent is, 
and if they even trust the troops, if they even trust the commanders in 
the field to have the flexibility that they need to respond.

Certainly today we have seen and have noted the demise of al-Masri 
who is the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Now I know that it is probably a 
subject that the majority doesn't want to talk about, that al-Masri was 
killed in Iraq, had been found there and had been working there. So it 
leads one to ask the question: What was he doing in Iraq? Why was he in 
Iraq? And why was it that he met his death in Iraq?

Well, the answer to that question is he was there because he and the 
other terrorists and the other terrorist groups all tell us the central 
front of the global war on terror is in Iraq. This is where they are 
fighting it.
