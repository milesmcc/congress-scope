`Mr. COSTELLO â€” 6 November 2007`

Mr. COSTELLO. I thank the gentlewoman, the Chair of the subcommittee, 
for yielding time to me, and I thank her for all of her hard work on 
this legislation, as well as Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, 
and the ranking member of the subcommittee.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the resolution to 
override the President's veto of the Water Resources Development Act.

Overriding the President's veto is extremely important, as this 
legislation addresses what the Congress and administration failed to do 
in previous years: enact a WRDA bill that addresses the critical 
infrastructure needs of our country.

WRDA authorizes projects from major flood control, navigation, 
environmental restoration, and other water resource projects, as well 
as includes authorizations of several important projects to restore and 
enhance the Nation's environmental infrastructure.

The United States transportation system has an extensive system of 
highways, ports, locks and dams, and airports; yet we continue to 
neglect upgrading and modernizing our infrastructure. We shouldn't 
build our infrastructure and then walk away without maintaining and 
modernizing it as it becomes antiquated, like we have done with the 
upper Mississippi and the Illinois Waterways lock and dam system.

In this WRDA bill, we are authorizing the Upper Mississippi and 
Illinois Waterway System. The bill authorizes the replacement of 600-
foot navigation locks with seven new 1,200-foot locks to bring more 
efficiency and effectiveness to our water transportation system.

Our current system looses about 10 percent of its capacity due to the 
system failure and breakdowns because it has exceeded its life 
expectancy by over 20 years. It can't handle the traffic in an 
efficient and cost-effective manner, and it's costing taxpayers tens of 
millions of dollars to patch it together every year, let alone the cost 
in time and money to its users.

At a time when we continue to spend $12 billion of the U.S. 
taxpayers' money every month in Iraq, I can't understand why the 
President would veto this important legislation. You have to ask the 
question, how can we afford to spend billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars 
to rebuild the infrastructure in Iraq but can't afford to invest in our 
own infrastructure right here at home?

This bill is 7 years overdue. Our infrastructure needs are growing. 
The President's veto message talks about priorities. I believe that the 
future of the U.S. economy and the living standards of our people 
should be our top priorities. This bill will help our farmers get their 
crops to market, protect critical habitat, and provide flood protection 
for our people.

Modernizing our infrastructure is the right thing to do. It is a 
necessity for our economy and commerce, and we, therefore, must 
override the President's veto today.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support overriding the President's veto of 
WRDA and urge my colleagues to do the same.
