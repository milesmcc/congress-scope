Mr. STUTZMAN. Madam Speaker, over 2 weeks ago, Staff Sergeant Kevin 
Matthew Pape, age 30, was killed by enemy forces during a heavy fire 
fight while conducting combat operations in the Konar province of 
Afghanistan.

Born February 5, 1980, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Sergeant Pape enlisted 
in the United States Army in September of 2005 from his home town of 
Fort Wayne. As a squad leader assigned to 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger 
Regiment, Staff Sergeant Pape was on a remarkable sixth deployment, 
with three previous deployments to Iraq and two to Afghanistan.

Sergeant Pape's awards and decorations for his service are too 
numerous to list here. However, he was awarded the Bronze Star, the 
Purple Heart, and the Meritorious Service medals.

Sergeant Pape is survived by his wife, Amelia Rose Pape; his 
daughter, Anneka Sue; his father, Marc Dennis Pape; and his sister, 
Kristen Michele Pape, both of Fort Wayne. Sergeant Pape selflessly 
lived his life for others, distinguishing himself as an Army Ranger 
while continuously deployed in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and 
Enduring Freedom and fighting valiantly as he served our great Nation 
and following the Ranger creed.
