Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my strong support 
for S. 2162, the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements 
Act of 2008, as amended. This bill includes provisions on mental health 
care, suicide prevention, care for substance use disorders, prevention 
of homelessness, pain and epilepsy care, and other health care matters. 
This comprehensive legislation addresses many critical issues facing 
our Nation's veterans.

Returning home from battle does not necessarily bring an end to 
conflict. Servicemembers return home, but the war often follows them in 
their hearts and minds. Their invisible wounds are


complicated and wide-ranging, and we must provide all possible 
assistance. I am working with VA Secretary James Peake to ensure that 
VA is forthright about the numbers of suicides and attempted suicides 
among veterans. Solid and reliable information is critical to our 
understanding of the issues. Prevention of suicide is a vitally 
important mission.

A growing number of veterans are in need of mental health care. VA's 
Special Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder advised in its 2006 
formal report that virtually all returning servicemembers face 
readjustment issues. An assessment of mental health problems among 
returning soldiers, recently published in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association in November, 2007, found that 42.4 percent of 
National Guard and reservists screened by the Department of Defense 
required mental health treatment.

Additionally, a March 2007 study published in the Archives of 
Internal Medicine reported that more than one-third of war veterans who 
have served in either Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from various mental 
ailments, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, 
depression, substance use disorder and other problems. A RAND study 
released in April 2008, emphasized the high risks of PTSD and 
depression, especially among servicemembers sent on multiple 
deployments, and among National Guard and reservists.

Further, the RAND study found that the stigma associated with mental 
health care continues to prevent servicemembers and veterans from 
accessing care. VA and the Department of Defense must redouble their 
efforts to ensure that receiving mental health care does not harm one's 
career. No individual is immune to the risk of mental health problems, 
and all must have the opportunity to receive care.

On April 25, 2007, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing 
on veterans' mental health concerns, and on VA's response. We heard 
heart-wrenching testimony from the witnesses.

The provisions of this bill are a direct outgrowth of that hearing 
and the testimony given by those who have suffered with mental health 
issues, and by their family members. Earlier versions of the provisions 
included in this bill were also discussed at a legislative hearing on 
October 24, 2007.

This bill represents a bi-partisan approach, and is cosponsored by 
Senators Burr, Rockefeller, Mikulski, Bingaman, Ensign, Smith, Collins, 
Clinton, Dole, and Sessions. It is a tribute to Justin Bailey, a 
veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, who died in a VA domiciliary 
facility while receiving care for PTSD and a substance use disorder. 
This was a tragedy that will live on with Justin's parents, who have so 
courageously advocated for improvements to VA mental health care.

Provisions included in this legislative package stem from bills which 
have all been reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Veterans' 
Affairs, including: S. 1233 as reported on August 29, 2007; and S. 
2004, S. 2142, S. 2160, and S. 2162, as ordered reported on November 
14, 2007.

I will briefly outline other provisions in S. 2162, as amended.

As I mentioned, the legislation would make sweeping changes to VA 
mental health treatment and research. Most notably, it would ensure a 
minimum level of substance use disorder care for veterans in need. It 
would also require VA to improve treatment of veterans with multiple 
disorders, such as PTSD and substance use disorder. To ascertain if 
VA's residential mental health facilities are appropriately staffed, 
this bill would mandate a review of such facilities. It would also 
create a vital research program on PTSD and Substance Use Disorders, in 
cooperation with, and building on the work of, the National Center for 
PTSD.

Veterans with physical and mental wounds often turn to drugs and 
alcohol to ease their pain. Experts believe that stress is the primary 
cause of drug abuse, and of relapse to drug abuse. Research by Sinha, 
Fuse, Aubin and O'Malley in Psychopharmacology, 2000, and by Brewer et 
al. in Addiction, 1998, has found that patients with psychological 
trauma, including PTSD, are often susceptible to alcohol and drug 
abuse. Similarly, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 
patients subjected to chronic stress, as experienced by those with 
PTSD, are prone to drug use. VA has long dealt with substance abuse 
issues, but there is much more than can be done. This legislation would 
provide a number of solutions to enhance substance use disorder 
treatment.

The inclusion of families in mental health treatment is vital. To 
this end, the bill would fully authorize VA to provide mental health 
services to families of veterans and would set up a program to help 
veterans and families transition to civilian life.

Beneficiary travel reimbursements are essential to improving access 
to VA health care for veterans in rural areas. This legislation would 
increase the beneficiary travel mileage reimbursement rate from 11 
cents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile, and permanently set the 
deductible to the 2007 amount of $3 each way.

It is important that veterans who rely on VA for their health care 
have access to emergency care. This bill would make corrections to the 
procedure used by VA to reimburse community hospitals for emergency 
care provided to eligible veterans so as to ensure that both veterans 
and community hospitals are not inappropriately burdened by emergency 
care costs.

Too often, veterans suffer from lack of care merely because they are 
unaware of the services available to them. This legislation would 
enhance outreach and accessibility by creating a pilot program on the 
use of peers to help reach out to veterans. It would also encourage 
improved accessibility for mental health care in rural areas.

The legislation also addresses homelessness, which is far too 
prevalent in the veteran population. The bill would create targeted 
programs to provide assistance for low-income veteran families. It 
would also allow homeless service providers to receive VA funds without 
offsetting other sources of income and require that facilities which 
furnish services to homeless veterans are able to meet the needs of 
women veterans.

The committee heard testimony that epilepsy is often associated with 
traumatic brain injury, the injury that many are calling the signature 
wound of the current conflicts. This suggests a strong need to improve 
VA's effectiveness in dealing with epilepsy. The pending legislation 
would establish six VA epilepsy centers of excellence, which will focus 
on research, education, and clinical care activities in the diagnosis 
and treatment of epilepsy. These centers would restore VA to the 
position of leadership it once held in epilepsy research and treatment.

The medical community has made impressive advances in pain care and 
management, but VA has lagged behind in implementing a standardized 
policy for dealing with pain. The bill includes a provision that would 
establish a pain care program at all inpatient facilities, to prevent 
long-term chronic pain disability. It also provides for education for 
VA's health care workers on pain assessment and treatment, and would 
require VA to expand research on pain care.

I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 2162, as amended. It has 
the potential to bring relief and support to tens of thousands of 
veterans and their families across the country.
