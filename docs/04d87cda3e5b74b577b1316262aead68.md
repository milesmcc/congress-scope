Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, a few minutes ago we heard King Abdullah 
of Jordan declare the imperative of peace between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians as central to assuring peace not only in the Middle East 
but throughout the world.

Speaking not only of Israelis and Palestinians but of Lebanese and 
Iraqis and of people all over the world, King Abdullah said, ''Let them 
have a life of peace.''

Indeed, it is our responsibility as leaders of the United States to 
respond to such an eloquent call by creating a restart of the peace 
process, which brings security, justice and peace to both Palestinians 
and Israelis.

When our brothers and sisters are killing each other, it is for us to 
use the power of compassion and love so that all may survive and 
prosper in security and peace.

This is a good moment for us to make a restart. This is a good moment 
for us to create a new context. This is a good moment for us to join 
with King Abdullah in speaking of people in the Middle East and 
throughout the world and saying, ''Let them have a life of peace.''
