Mr. WARNER. But I say, in response to my distinguished colleague, it 
is for that very reason the President is dispatching the Secretaries of 
State and Defense into that region, to bring that point very clearly, 
this problem which is being experienced in Iraq. And when


I say ''experienced,'' I mean devastating loss of life of Iraqi 
citizens, considerable loss of life of our own forces, and loss of 
limb. That is something which every Senator on both sides of the aisle 
is concerned with daily. But thus far, the bordering nations certainly 
have not stepped up, in my estimation, to take a constructive role. If 
anything, we have, in Syria and Iran, pretty convincing evidence that 
they are taking steps antithetical to bringing about a resolution of 
some sort of peace and stability in Iraq.
