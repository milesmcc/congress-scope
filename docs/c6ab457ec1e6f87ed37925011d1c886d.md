Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that we are 
getting into the home stretch for the MILCON-VA appropriations bill. We 
have been on this bill 6 days now--I believe a record for the MILCON/VA 
bill. I thank my ranking member, Senator Hutchison, for her help in 
clearing amendments last evening which has put us within striking 
distance of completing this bill today.

The first amendment we are scheduled to vote on today is an amendment 
I have offered that will provide $50 million for the VA to renovate and 
use empty buildings sitting on VA medical campuses to provide housing 
with supportive services for our homeless vets.

The VA Secretary and the President have made eliminating homelessness 
among vets a top priority. The amendment is fully offset by redirecting 
$50 million over the President's budget request provided in this bill 
for DOD's Homeowners Assistance Program which the Pentagon has 
determined is not currently required.

This amendment is supported by 16 vets and homeless service 
organizations, including the VFW, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and 
Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

I ask unanimous consent to have letters in support of my amendment 
printed in the Record.
