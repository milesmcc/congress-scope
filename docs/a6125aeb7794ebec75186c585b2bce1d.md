Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory 
of Captain Hayes Clayton, a heroic member of our military who was 
killed in action on Christmas day in Balad, Iraq.

Captain Clayton was a classmate of my daughter, Laura Neil. She 
remembers his strength of character. Others have remembered his 
strength of faith. Indeed, Captain Clayton leaves behind a legacy of 
living by the highest moral principles.

Before enlisting in the Army, Captain Clayton was known as a standout 
defensive end on the football team at Marietta High School and a 
skilled Army ROTC member at Fort Valley State University in Georgia.

Captain Clayton leaves behind his parents, Reverend Hayes and Marlena 
Clayton, his brothers Eric and Michael, his loving wife Army First 
Lieutenant Monica Clayton, and a precious 4-month-old son, Hayes, III, 
who proudly carries on his father's name.

Mr. Speaker, my prayers go out to his family and my deepest gratitude 
goes out for his selfless and deep sacrifice for our Nation. I ask you 
to join me in honoring the distinguished memory of Captain Hayes 
Clayton.
