# REACHING AN AGREEMENT
## `f207761acf11c5a4e5cf336b04e97ed3`
`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 14 March 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just indicate that Republican 
Senators will be voting for cloture on the motion to proceed. The 
majority leader has it entirely correct. He and I will be discussing 
during the course of the day how to proceed, both on the Iraq issue and 
on the U.S. attorney proposal, and we will be, as I indicated, trying 
to reach an agreement on both of those matters.
