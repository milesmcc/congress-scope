Mr. HOYER. FISA legislation, as the gentleman knows, is being worked 
on by the Intelligence Committee now. I don't have a specific answer 
for you. I am hopeful that we will perhaps be able to address some very 
important issues before we leave here.

On the other, I think it is possible that we will have some 
legislation dealing with Iraq, but that decision has not been made. 
Obviously, there is still ongoing discussion both in the Senate and in 
this body on that subject. But whether there will be legislation next 
week is still in discussion.
