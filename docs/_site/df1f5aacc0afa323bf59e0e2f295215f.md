`Mr. BERMAN â€” 19 June 2008`

---


Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I would like to call the attention of my 
colleagues in the Congress to another successful meeting of the 
Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) that was held in Ljubljana, 
Slovenia, from May 24-26, 2008. The United States delegation continues 
to flourish under the outstanding leadership of Chairwoman Shelley 
Berkley, the gentlelady from Nevada. She has injected energy and 
enthusiasm into this interparliamentary dialogue, while further 
strengthening American relationships with a wide range of European 
parliamentarians. The Republican vice-chairman, Representative Cliff 
Stearns from Florida, has also maintained an effective voice in 
European affairs and the TLD.

Representatives Berkley and Stearns should be praised for their 
efforts to recruit members to participate in the Slovenia session, with 
the delegation of 10 members being the largest and by all reports most 
well informed in recent years. I commend the members of this bipartisan 
delegation--Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-NY), Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX), Rep. 
Russ Carnahan (D-MO), Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), Rep Sheila Jackson-Lee 
(D-TX), Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY), and Rep. 
Loretta Sanchez (D-CA)--for contributing to a rich and meaningful 
exchange of views.

 The TLD serves as the formal response of the European Parliament and 
the U.S. Congress to the commitment in the New Transatlantic Agenda 
(NTA) of 1995 to enhance legislative ties between the European Union 
and the United States. Building on the existing interparliamentary 
relationship, the TLD involves bi-annual meetings between American and 
European legislators in order to discuss topics of mutual interest and 
foster transatlantic discourse.

 The most recent session in Slovenia addressed a wide range of 
foreign policy challenges, including the Middle East, China, Russia, 
and Kosovo. Members discussed regulatory initiatives being undertaken 
by the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), with American members 
reinforcing Administration


concerns about European initiatives on poultry and chemicals used to 
manufacture cosmetics that have a detrimental effect on American 
farmers and producers. American members also responded to European 
concerns about the visa waiver program and legislation requiring 100% 
cargo scanning to ensure port security. In addition, the delegates 
discussed the challenge of climate change, the importance of energy 
security, and the current global financial crisis.

 Madam Speaker, I would like to place in the Record the joint 
statement that was agreed upon by American and European legislators at 
the 64th TLD meeting in Ljubljana. It underscores the rich agenda of 
this meeting and highlights the many areas in which there was strong 
transatlantic agreement.

 Transatlantic Legislator's Dialogue--64th Meeting of Delegations From 

the European Parliament and the United States, Ljubljana, 24-26 May 













2008 Joint Statement




 We, Members of the European Parliament and the United 


 States House of Representatives, held our 64th 


 Interparliamentary meeting (Transatlantic Legislators' 


 Dialogue) in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 24-26 May 2008.




Building on the joint statement issued following our last 


 meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 5-8 October 2007, we 


 stressed the importance of regular dialogue on a range of 


 political, social and economic issues that affect all of our 


 citizens. We agreed to report back to our parent bodies on 


 the content and outcome of our discussions, particularly in 


 the areas where joint efforts are likely to result in 


 positive outcomes. We agreed that legislators in both sides 


 of the Atlantic should increase dialogue and consultation 


 amongst themselves in order to prevent possible conflicts of 


 legislation. Direct and timely contacts between specialist 


 committees from Congress and the European Parliament--such as 


 those that have occurred within the TLD framework--have been 


 valuable means of reinforcing cooperation; this exchange of 


 information should be continued and enhanced.




We examined a wide array of foreign policy issues, 


 agreeing that joint action by the European Union and the 


 United States is the most effective way to approach problems 


 that affect both sides of the Atlantic. We took stock of 


 recent developments with regard to the Middle East Peace 


 process, the nuclear threat posed by Iran and the situation 


 in Iraq. On Afghanistan, we recognized the need for a joint 


 long-term strategy aimed at stabilizing the internal 


 situation and reducing risks for regional security. We noted 


 a proposal to develop a joint fund for humanitarian services 


 and infrastructure development in Afghanistan. We discussed 


 the future political an economical development in Kosovo, and 


 recognized that joint efforts were essential in order to 


 ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for the Western 


 Balkans, including an EU perspective. We analyzed development 


 in Russia's domestic and foreign policies, including the U.S. 


 Administration's proposed missile defense plans as well as 


 European efforts to diversify their energy supply and ensure 


 their energy security. We also assessed our economic and 


 political relationship with China, expressing concern over 


 recent events in Tibet.




The dialogue focused on the ongoing discussions between 


 the U.S. and the EU in order to extend access to the U.S. 


 Visa Waiver programme in the future to all EU Member States, 


 as well as to the importance of ensuring safe trade an port 


 security.




We also discussed the current global financial crisis. We 


 agreed on the need for continued discussion and joint actions 


 to address the effects of climate change.




With regard to the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), 


 we noted with satisfaction the engagement of the TLD on 13 


 May 2008 with TEC Co-Chairs Gunther Verheugen and Dan Price 


 in the framework of the 'Advisory group'. The European 


 Parliament Resolution on the TEC and the letter by the U.S. 


 TLD leadership to the TEC formed the basis for this dialogue. 


 We took note of the EU-U.S. High Level Regulatory Forum, the 


 joint reports on strengthening cooperation regarding the 


 safety of imported products, and the impact assessment 


 guidelines. We advocated stronger involvement of legislators 


 in contributing to and overseeing these initiatives. We 


 supported the identification of compatible biofuels standards 


 in order to achieve international harmonization at the level 


 of international standards organizations. We also welcomed 


 the joint statement on open investment, as well as the start 


 of the second phase of negotiations for the air services 


 agreement.




We welcome the fact that the TEC has become a permanent 


 feature of the EU/U.S. relations. We also welcome the 


 decision taken on 13 May 2008 to develop a short term agenda 


 and long term roadmap for TEC activities, and consider that 


 this represents and important step towards ensuring the 


 continuity of the process. As we have done throughout the 


 establishment and initial meetings of the TEC, we continue to 


 assert that the TEC initiative should be characterized by 


 transparency and consultation of stakeholders and we call on 


 the EU and U.S. Administration to reinforce the flow of 


 information to the TLD in advance of the TEC meetings. 


 Awareness of the transatlantic impact of proposed legislation 


 and regulations should be developed in the relevant 


 legislative and regulatory bodies, as well as information 


 about the benefits of rapid advancements towards a barrier-


 free regulatory environment.




Several items have been identified within the TEC agenda 


 that require further legislative consideration: While 


 achieving reciprocity and mutual recognition of security 


 standards remains critically important, we call on the U.S. 


 Congress to review their legislation requiring 100 percent 


 cargo scanning in recognition of European concerns regarding 


 this legislation We call on the European Parliament to 


 facilitate an early solution to the ongoing discussions on 


 the ban on imports into the EU of U.S. poultry which has 


 undergone pathogen reduction treatment In regards to the EU's 


 regulation on the registration of chemicals (REACH) we call 


 on the European Commission to bring forward legislation 


 ensuring that European and U.S. producers of cosmetics are 


 treated equitably in their requirement to register substances 


 used in their products with the EU's chemical agency.




Finally, we welcome progress on items contained in the 


 'lighthouse projects' and related initiatives included in the 


 2007 Summit declaration. In particular, we call for: Steps 


 towards allowing the use in the United States of suppliers' 


 declarations of conformity for electrical, electronic and ICT 


 products; Further progress towards the mutual recognition of 


 U.S. GAAP and EU IFRS accounting standards; Discussion of 


 U.S. and EU regulatory issues in the insurance sector, in 


 order to enhance market access for brokers-dealers, exchanges 


 and other trading systems; and Progress in other areas of 


 regulatory cooperation, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, 


 and animal testing.




In conclusion, both sides renewed their commitment to make 


 the TLD's work more relevant to the European Parliament and 


 to the United States House of Representatives. We agreed to 


 identify ways by which to reinforce the involvement of the 


 TLD and our legislatures in the preparation of the EU/U.S. 


 Summit. We also agreed to further improve the effectiveness 


 of our dialogue in order to realize the full potential of our 


 interparliamentary relationship.
