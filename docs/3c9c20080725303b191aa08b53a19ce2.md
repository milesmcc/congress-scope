# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `3c9c20080725303b191aa08b53a19ce2`
`Mr. HUNTER â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute just to respond to 
my friend from Tennessee.

Let me just point out that we are spending roughly 4 percent of GDP 
on defense at this point. President Ronald Reagan spent 6 percent. 
President John Kennedy, 9 percent. Operations in the war against terror 
are not bankrupting this country.

With respect to the group of allies that the gentleman called our few 
remaining friends, I am reminded that there is a number of them like 
Poland and Moldavia and Herzegovina and Georgia and Bosnia and 
Azerbaijan and Armenia and Albania, lots of little countries that used 
to be behind the Iron Curtain or in the case of El Salvador, in what 
was called by the Democrat Party the unwinnable war in Central America 
in Salvador, those countries, which themselves were the beneficiaries 
of an American policy of expanding freedom are standing with our 
country in this operation in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Calvert), who is a member of the Armed Services 
Committee.
