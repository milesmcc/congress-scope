Mr. DURBIN. I respect the Senator and his service to our country in 
uniform as well as the Secretary of the Navy and of course his service 
in the Senate. I ask him this question:

Let's assume that 120 days from now, the report comes back and says 
the Iraqi military is not prepared to stand and defend its own country. 
What responsibility then falls on our shoulders?
