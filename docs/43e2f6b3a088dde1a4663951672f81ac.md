Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I simply want to say that I did hear my 
colleague say how concerned we all were about corruption and how much 
we really wanted to do about it. Unfortunately, for the past 3 years 
nothing on your side was done about it. It was never looked into, 
despite the fact that our side brought it up numerous times, trying to 
get bills to the floor and trying to discuss what was going on in Iraq 
in terms of the loss of taxpayer money. I regret that that has not been 
acknowledged. This is the first time that we have literally brought up 
the actual corruption in the Iraq Government.
