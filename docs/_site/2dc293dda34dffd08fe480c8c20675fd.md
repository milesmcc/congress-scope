`Ms. MATSUI â€” 14 November 2007`

Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for 
yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, today's debate is not about political calculation. It is 
not about public appearance or ready-made slogans. It is not about 
approval ratings or polls.

Today's debate is about the very future of this country that each one 
of us loves so dearly. It is a fork in the road. It is a rare 
opportunity for each of us to chart the course of the Nation we serve 
by casting a single vote.

Today we can vote for the status quo in Iraq or we can vote for 
change. For me, this choice is simple. I will vote for change.

The war in Iraq has divided our country for nearly 5 years, longer 
than our participation in World War II. Its monetary cost has already 
reached dizzying heights. Measured in casualties lost, lives forever 
altered, the toll of this war is truly staggering.

That is why we must transcend politics and party loyalty when we vote 
today. An issue of this magnitude requires each one of us as Members of 
Congress to vote based on our conscience and obligation to represent 
our constituents.

Mr. Speaker, on this issue my conscience and my constituents speak 
loud and clear. They say, We must end this war. Bring our troops home 
and work to restore our international reputation.

I stand here today in support of this rule and the underlying 
legislation because it accomplishes each of these three goals:

Within 30 days of enactment, it requires an immediate and orderly 
redeployment of our military from Iraq. No more delays, Mr. Speaker.

With today's bill, Congress stands with the American people in 
demanding a swift and responsible conclusion to military engagement in 
Iraq.

I also support this legislation because of what it does in the long 
term. It recognizes that we have a moral and strategic obligation to 
help rebuild Iraq, to avoid leaving a country in shambles.

The legislation before us today requires a comprehensive, diplomatic, 
political, and economic strategy for Iraq. We must work with our 
international partners to bring stability to Iraq, and this legislation 
does so. A renewed commitment to diplomacy is not only the right thing 
to do to fulfill our commitment to the Iraqi people, it also begins 
restoring our Nation's standing in the world.

I urge all of my colleagues to stand with the American people by 
voting for the bill before us today. This legislation takes a strong 
step forward in ending this long and costly war. In doing so, it is 
worthy of this House, worthy of the constituents we all serve, and 
worthy of the sacrifices of our soldiers and their families.
