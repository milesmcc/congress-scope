Mr. FILNER. Mr. Chairman, as the chairman of the Authorizing 
Committee, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I want to thank 
Chairman Edwards, Chairman Obey, and his ranking members, for giving us 
this bill and a whole series of bills that preceded this since our 
party has taken over the majority of this body.

Not only have we for the first time with fiscal years 2008 and 2009 
exceeded


the budget requests in the so-called independent budget, which is put 
together by veterans' groups for veterans, and for the first time we 
exceeded them 2 years in a row. Not only that, but with the fiscal year 
2007, which we had to pick up, and several supplemental bills which we 
had to pass, we have added, in my calculation, over $17 million worth 
of new money for the health care of our veterans, which is an 
unprecedented 40 percent increase since Chairman Edwards and Chairman 
Obey have been chairmen of those committees. That is incredible.

We have put resources in place to do the job for our veterans, but 
the Veterans Administration doesn't always do what we intend, or do it 
with the efficiency that we would like. Many of you have heard the 
horror stories of young people going to medical centers, asking for 
PTSD help, post-traumatic stress disorder, being told that they can't 
get an appointment for 5 or 6 weeks, going home and committing suicide.

We have had the Secretary of the VA tell me, when I said, Aren't a 
thousand suicide attempts per month by our veterans a concern? He said, 
No. It's consistent with the literature. We have had a Secretary, Under 
Secretary of Defense say that 300,000 PTSD victims of our forces in 
Iraq and 320,000 victims of brain injury were not a problem because 
those were just symptoms of those injuries. They didn't really exhibit 
full-blown PTSD or full-blown traumatic brain injury and therefore they 
weren't concerned about it. So their concern, Mr. Chairman, has not 
always equaled our commitment here.

My two amendments would try to have dealt with that in a way that I 
hope and I know the chairman will work with me in the future.

Do you know that tens of thousands of our young people leave Iraq and 
Afghanistan, whether they are in the active duty or the Reserves or the 
National Guard, without any evaluation by medical personnel for either 
PTSD or brain injury?

We have to do something about that, Mr. Chairman. I have proposed, 
and we will work with you as we authorize what I am calling a Hero's 
Homecoming camp, to say that every soldier with his or her company, 
with his or her family, will be evaluated by medical personnel for 
brain injury and PTSD, and before they are discharged from the service. 
I had asked for $10 million to cooperate with the DOD to do that.

In addition, one of the chief weaknesses of the Veterans 
Administration is they don't like outside help. They don't ask for 
community support. All over this country, people want to help our 
troops. So I have asked at some point for $250 million for community 
grants to help our soldiers in their own communities who have mental 
health and other injuries for their treatment and rehabilitation.

This is something I think we have to do, Mr. Chairman. I know you 
agree with me in principle. I know this is not the time and place to 
debate that or put that in the bill. Your commitment to our soldiers, 
sailors airmen, and marines is well known. Just putting that out there, 
that we have to do this community support, mandatory evaluations, that 
I know that we can work together.

I will withdraw the amendment.
