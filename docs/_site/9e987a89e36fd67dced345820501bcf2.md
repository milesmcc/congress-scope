`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 1 May 2007`

---


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Can I share with the American people and our 
colleagues one more? First, I thought it was interesting, and our crack 
staff here, the President gave his speech in front of the Jefferson 
Memorial. We've got a great quote, 1789, when Jefferson wrote a letter 
to Madison talking about war. ''We have already given one effectual 
check to the dog of war, by transferring the power of letting him loose 
from the Executive to the Legislative body, from those who are to spend 
to those who are to pay.''

And I think it would be appropriate, if Mr. Bush is going to use 
President Jefferson as a backdrop, that he should recognize at least 
his philosophy on some of these issues.

But a quote from General John Batiste, retired general. Today, and 
this is on his response to the President's veto. ''The President vetoed 
our troops and the American people. His stubborn commitment to a failed 
strategy in Iraq is incomprehensible. He committed our great military 
to a failed strategy in violation of basic principles of war. His 
failure to mobilize the Nation to defeat worldwide Islamic extremism is 
tragic.''



''We deserve more from our Commander in Chief and his 
administration.'' That is Major General John Batiste, retired general.

It has been a pleasure being here with you today. I hope this week, 
with the leadership of Leader Pelosi, that we continue to stand strong 
behind the American people. And you can be assured, Mr. Speaker, that 
when Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid are there tomorrow negotiating that they 
will be representing the will of the American people, the 65 percent of 
the American people that want a deadline to get us out.

30somethingdems@mail.house.gov for any e-mails that the Members may 
want to send us. The charts that we have here, some we showed tonight 
and some we didn't, are all on our Web site www.speaker.gov/
30something. And, again, the e-mail address is
