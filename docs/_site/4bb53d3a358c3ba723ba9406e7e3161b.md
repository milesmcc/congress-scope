Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to honor the 
life of Sergeant First Class William ''Bill'' Zapfe. Sergeant Zapfe was 
serving with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division as a combat engineer when 
he was tragically killed by an improvised explosive device last month. 
Sergeant Zapfe was a dedicated soldier on his third tour in Iraq.

Bill grew up in Park Hills and Dry Ridge, Kentucky, and joined the 
military shortly after graduating from high school. He came from a 
family of dedicated public servants. His late father, Joseph, was a 
State trooper, and his two brothers, Joseph and Edward, have also both 
dutifully served our Nation. He is remembered by his family as a loving 
and devoted husband and father. Bill Zapfe is a true patriot who died 
fighting for a cause he believed in. Bill leaves behind his mother, 
Jeanne; his loving wife, Evelyn; and his three children, Anastasia, 
Cameron, and Spencer.

Today, as we honor the life of Sergeant Zapfe, our thoughts and 
prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time.

We thank Sergeant Zapfe for his service and for answering the call to 
protect our great Nation.
