`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 19 March 2007`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 214 as an urgently 
needed step in our effort to restore our constitutional system of 
checks and balances and to protect the rule of law.

In recent weeks, Congress has finally begun to investigate the 
damaging politicization of the administration of justice by the White 
House and the Department of Justice. The problem did not begin with the 
recently disclosed firings of eight U.S. attorneys. It was well 
underway in 2002 when Attorney General Ashcroft abolished the process 
for hiring new career attorneys for the Department of Justice.

That process had been established by the Eisenhower administration 
half a century ago to eliminate partisanship and cronyism in the 
Department's hiring. Under Attorney General Ashcroft, however, the 
process was placed entirely in the hands of political appointees who 
set out to remake the ranks of career attorneys by hiring new attorneys 
based on partisan and ideological qualifications. Predictably, the 
result has been partisan and ideological law enforcement.

The civil rights division virtually stopped enforcing the Voting 
Rights Act on behalf of African Americans. It even sued African-
American officials in Mississippi for discriminating against White 
voters. Contrary to the recommendations of career attorneys, the new 
regime also approved the Texas redistricting law that was later struck 
down by the Supreme Court. It also approved a Georgia photo 
identification law for voting that was subsequently struck down by a 
Federal Court as a poll tax. Approval of the Georgia photo 
identification law was driven by the same partisan motivation that 
produced the current U.S. attorney scandal.

Georgia's Republican-dominated State legislature said it was enacting 
the law to respond to allegations of voter fraud. But evidence of fraud 
to justify the law did not exist. The ID law was passed anyway, with 
full awareness that it would disproportionately prevent minorities from 
voting.

When the law was submitted to the Civil Rights Division for approval 
under the Voting Rights Act, the career staff of attorneys and analysts 
recommended an objection by the Department, which would have prevented 
the law from going into effect, but the recommendation was rejected by 
the political appointees.

The Federal Court struck down the law as the equivalent of a poll 
tax, because the State offered to sell ID's for $20 to prospective 
voters who did not have them. Tellingly, the State did not establish 
offices selling ID's in many of the State's most heavily minority 
districts.

After the law was blocked, the State reenacted it without the $20 
fee, in a blatant effort to gain partisan advantage by manipulating the 
law. Once again, the political appointees in the Civil Rights Division 
approved it. Fortunately, a court struck down the new law, finding that 
it placed an undue burden on the voting rights of minority and elderly 
voters.

The story does not end there. Shortly after political officials 
rejected the career attorneys' recommendation to block the law, they 
transferred Robert Berman--the leader of the career team that reviewed 
the Georgia law and a 28-year veteran of the Civil Rights Division--out 
of his job as a Deputy Chief of the Voting Section and into a dead-end 
training job.

When the Attorney General testified before the Judiciary Committee 
last July, I asked whether this transfer was retaliation for the career 
attorney's role in recommending that the Department object to the 
Georgia photo ID law. I still haven't received an answer. When Wan Kim, 
the head of the Civil Rights Division, testified before the Committee 
in November, I asked him if Mr. Berman was transferred in retaliation 
for the Georgia matter. I still haven't received an answer.

As the problems in the Civil Rights Division make clear, the real 
danger with this administration's politicization of Justice 
Department's hiring is the corruption of the rule of law. U.S. 
Attorneys and other Department of Justice officials are selected by the 
President, but they are the people's lawyers. Their first duty is to 
enforce the rule of law--not to push a partisan agenda. This 
administration has forgotten that basic truth, and the rule of law has 
suffered.

The conclusion is inescapable that the Department of Justice ended 
Mr. Berman's long and distinguished career as a voting section attorney 
because he applied the law faithfully and well, and refused to serve 
the partisan interests of his political superiors. His plight is one of 
many examples of loyal career public servants who have been pushed 
aside for their failure to toe the partisan line in the Department of 
Justice.

Incredibly, Bradley Schlozman, the inexperienced political appointee 
who oversaw approval of the Georgia ID law and the retaliation against 
the career staff, was rewarded with an appointment as interim U.S. 
attorney for the Western District of Missouri. He has served in that 
capacity for a year without Senate confirmation. Mr. Schlozman's 
appointment is symptomatic of the problem that the bill before us will 
solve--the appointment as U.S. attorneys of unqualified partisan 
operatives who would be unlikely to win Senate confirmation, but who 
can serve for extended periods of time anyway.

The continuing revelations about the 8 fired U.S. attorneys show how 
thoroughly partisanship has infected the administration of justice in 
the Bush administration. As explanation after explanation has 
unraveled, it has become increasingly clear that the purge of U.S. 
attorneys had its genesis in the White House and its roots in a desire 
to remove U.S. attorneys who were not sufficiently committed to the 
political agenda of the administration.



The initial explanation that 7 of the 8 were fired for poor 
performance was a smokescreen manufactured out of thin air. Their 
performance assessments were largely outstanding. Evidence is mounting 
that the administration was concerned that Carol Lam was too successful 
in her investigation and prosecution of Republicans in the Duke 
Cunningham scandal. John McKay was on the list because of his refusal 
to open an unwarranted investigation into voter fraud after a close 
2004 election victory by a Democrat. David Iglesias was the subject of 
Republican complaints about his unwillingness to pursue voter fraud 
investigations of Democrats, and he was pressured by Republicans in 
Congress to indict Democrats before last November's election to help 
the Republican candidate in a tight congressional race.

Recently released e-mails show that part of this scheme was to use 
the little-noticed change in the law inserted in the reauthorization of 
the Patriot Act last year which permitted the Attorney General to 
appoint interim U.S. attorneys to serve indefinitely without Senate 
confirmation. The bill before us eliminates that provision and 
reinstates the 120-day limit on service by interim U.S. attorneys 
appointed by the Attorney General. This change will force the 
administration to send nominees to the Senate to fill vacant slots, or 
have them filled by a court instead.

This change in the law is an important first step we can take to 
remedy the problem, as we continue to investigate the political purge 
of U.S. attorneys. That investigation must continue. A full 
investigation is essential if we hope to restore confidence in Federal 
law enforcement. U.S. attorneys protect the Nation from violent crime, 
terrorism, violations of civil rights, organized crime and public 
corruption. They must be above partisan or ethical reproach, if the 
rule of law is to have any meaning in our modern society.

There are few greater threats to our democracy than such efforts to 
turn our system of Federal law enforcement into a partisan political 
tool. As Justice Robert Jackson said:




 The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty and 


 reputation than any other person in America.

That awesome power must not be used in the service of partisan goals. 
U.S. attorneys are political appointees, but once they are appointed, 
they can no longer be part of the political process. Politics can shape 
policies and priorities but the decision whether or not to investigate 
or prosecute cannot be influenced by the slightest hint of 
partisanship. No U.S. attorneys should be subjected to partisan 
political pressure to make a particular decision in a prosecution, and 
no U.S. attorney should be retaliated against for making decisions that 
are politically unpopular in the eyes of his superiors.

The bill before us will help guard against such partisanship, by 
restoring the requirement for the administration to submit nominees for 
U.S. attorneys promptly to the Senate for confirmation, and I urge my 
colleagues to pass this bill without amendment.

Mr. President, as our Nation begins its fifth year of the war in Iraq 
it is abundantly clear to the American people that our current policy 
has failed, and that we need a new policy that will better serve both 
our national security and our service men and women.

President Bush continues to look for good news with a microscope. 
Despite his repeated claims that success is just around the corner, 
Iraq is falling deeper and deeper into the chaos of civil war. Our 
troops are in the untenable position of policing a nation at war with 
itself.

More than 3,200 American soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice, 
and more than 24,000 have been wounded during the 4 years of his failed 
policy.

Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed, and nearly 4 
million have been displaced inside Iraq and across the region.

The insurgency is growing in strength, and its lethal explosives are 
growing in sophistication.

Attacks on American soldiers continue to increase.

Militias are increasing their power, and their ability to brutalize 
the Iraqi people is increasing as well.

No amount of American military might can end Iraq's civil war. Only a 
political settlement by Iraqi leaders and the Iraqi people can end the 
bloodshed and suffering.

Rather than fanning the flames of chaos by sending more U.S. troops 
into Iraq's civil war, it is time for the President to begin to 
redeploy our troops out of harm's way.

The war in Iraq has been a disastrous and deeply dangerous debacle in 
American foreign policy. It has made America more hated in the world 
than at any other time in our history. It has emboldened terrorists 
across the globe. It has stretched our military to the breaking point. 
As a result, our national security is increasingly at risk.

The President's policy of escalating the war will not make success 
any more likely. It will only result in more death and more tragedy for 
American soldiers, and it will undermine our national security even 
further.

The American people have been patient. But America has now been in 
Iraq longer than it took us to win World War II. Instead of progress, 
we continue to see unacceptably high levels of violence, death, and 
destruction.

The American military and the American people deserve far better. The 
President seeks more funding for the war without strings and without 
delay.

Because the President stubbornly insists on escalating the same 
failed strategy, Congress must stand up to the President and stand up 
for our troops by requiring him to redeploy our combat forces out of 
Iraq as soon as possible. We have an opportunity to do so on the 
supplemental appropriations bill that will soon be before us, and it is 
an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
