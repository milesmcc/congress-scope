Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am submitting Senate amendment No. 3124 
to make funds available from the appropriation account Other 
Procurement, Air Force, to accelerate the deployment of the Associate 
Intermodal Platform pallet system.

The Associate Intermodal Platform pallet system is manufactured by 
Shan Industries LLC, headquartered in Miami, FL, with manufacturing 
plants currently located in New Jersey and Oklahoma.

The Department of Defense has concluded that use of the Associate 
Intermodal Platform, AIP, pallet system, developed 2 years ago by the 
U.S. Transportation Command, could save the United States as much as 
$1,300,000 for every 1,000 pallets deployed. The Associate Intermodal 
Platform pallet system can be used to transport cargo alone within 
current International Standard of Organization containers, or in 
conjunction with existing 463L pallets. The Associate Intermodal 
Platform pallet system has successfully passed rigorous testing by the 
U.S. Transportation Command at various military installations in the 
United States and in the field in Iraq, Kuwait, and Antarctica. The 
Associate Intermodal Platform pallet system has performed well beyond 
expectations and is ready for immediate production and deployment.
