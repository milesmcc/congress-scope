Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his continued 
leadership.

It is not just General Petraeus that moveon.org attacks. One of the 
distinguished, I think very reasonable members of the Democratic Caucus 
here in the house, Brian Baird of Washington State, also has been 
protested by moveon.org in his office since he returned from Iraq in 
August and basically told what he saw. He came back and just said, this 
is what I saw: There is progress, and we shouldn't leave precipitously 
because there will be major consequences.

He told the truth. He is an honorable guy. He serves here in the 
House. I respect him. He is a Democrat, and moveon sends hundreds of 
people to protest at his office. It is a political agenda, and it is 
unfortunate.

I grew up a Democrat. The first half of my life I was a Democrat; the 
second half I was a Republican. I don't think either party has an 
exclusive on integrity or ideas, but I think this is so far over the 
top.

There used to be things that we did in this country as Americans, not 
as Democrats and Republicans. This should not be about winning the next 
election or the last election. Wars should not divide us along Democrat 
and Republican lines, and everything should not be seen through that 
prism, and moveon.org is shameless to do this. It is shameless, this 
advertisement in The New York Times, and, as the gentleman from Georgia 
said, everyone in this body should condemn


what they are doing to try to win elections over our men and women in 
uniform in Iraq.

My nephew is serving there in Iraq right now. I hate it that he would 
turn around and see this in a full page ad in a major newspaper against 
the most equipped leader to lead our forces in Iraq that our country 
has to offer, period, is who this is.

For them to slander him in this way for political gain is un-
American. What they have done is un-American. They have the right under 
the Constitution to say it, and we have the right as Americans to 
reject it, and everybody in this House should do that.

Three main things, while I have an opportunity to speak tonight.

The mission is just. We lose sight of that sometimes, that our men 
and women in uniform are doing and carrying out what is right for our 
country at this very volatile time in world history.

It is also easy to forget that over half the Democrats in the United 
States Senate and almost half the Democrats in the U.S. House of 
Representatives voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force. And others 
will come and say, oh, George Bush sold us a bunch of bad information.

Listen, if there was any bad information, everyone had the same 
information, and many of us voted, from both sides of the aisle, to 
remove Saddam Hussein by force. It is just very convenient now to say, 
oh, that was them and not me.

It is hard to take responsibility for your actions. It is hard to 
stand before the American people and say we need to work through this 
together. We need to stand behind our troops until they prevail, until 
we have victory and not retreat in Iraq, instead of saying this is all 
about them. It used to be in this country about us. We did things like 
this together, and we didn't retreat so the world would see us walk 
away from our commitments. This mission is just, number one.

Number two, the military has been extraordinary. They have been 
great. You heard General Petraeus say that today. What the Marines have 
done in Anbar, the progress that has been made there, it wasn't even 
hardly covered by the GAO report. They didn't even talk about the 
extraordinary success, civilian casualties way down, 80 percent success 
in the Anbar Province.

The moderates are even siding up with us and saying ''We don't like 
al Qaeda. They are cutting off our people's fingers. They are killing 
our children. We want to fight with the Americans against these 
insurgents.''

That is not the way it was before we strengthened our forces and had 
this success in Anbar. The military is performing in an extraordinary 
way and the tribal governments are now siding with us. That is progress 
by any definition.

The military is succeeding in Iraq. You may not want to hear it, 
because, as one of your distinguished leaders said, you are in trouble 
politically if we succeed as a Nation in Iraq. That is what he said. I 
hated that he said it. That is terrible. That is an indictment on 
politics in America. We all win if we beat these terrorists in Iraq. 
Everyone in this country wins. The military is succeeding.

Number three, the political progress in Iraq is not happening. That 
is true. We need to be honest about it. I wish personally we could get 
rid of the Maliki government because I think it is deplorable. But we 
promoted free elections and that is what we got, and we can't very well 
turn around now and say, oh, we didn't like who you elected. Get rid of 
him. They have got to do that. That is the tough work of freedom. They 
have got to do that. I hope they do. But that is up to them. 
Politically, we are not succeeding the way we need to succeed in Iraq, 
and all of us in this House have an obligation to come together and see 
that through to completion.

Let me just close with this: I have worked for 13 years in a 
bipartisan way. I have scars on my back to prove it. I have made people 
on my side of the aisle livid with some of the positions that I have 
taken working with the other side. But I will not----
