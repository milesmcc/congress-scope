`Mr. LEVIN â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on the question of the 60 votes, there is a 
procedural roadblock which is being placed here. It is not the first 
time in history, of course, but a decision has to be made here whether 
the verdict of the American people last November that there be a change 
in policy is going to be thwarted by that procedural roadblock, and the 
Republican leader has apparently decided it will be.

In terms of precedent, last year on the Defense authorization bill, 
there


were at least two votes on Iraq, both majority votes. That is the 
precedent. Last year, there was a Levin-Reed amendment that received 39 
votes and a Kerry amendment, both on Iraq on the Defense authorization 
bill, the most recent experience. This issue is so vital. It is so much 
in the minds of the American people that we should not throw up 
procedural roadblocks to allowing the Senate to vote. That is why we 
have asked that we be allowed to vote up or down on this amendment, and 
that apparently has now been objected to.
