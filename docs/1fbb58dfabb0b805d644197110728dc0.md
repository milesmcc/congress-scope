`Mr. PALLONE â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that 70 percent of 
Americans support withdrawing almost all U.S. troops from Iraq by 
April, and despite a growing number of retired generals and senior 
Republican Senators joining Democrats in calling for a new strategy in 
Iraq, many House Republicans remain staunchly in favor of the 
President's failed Iraq policy. In fact, just last week, the leader of 
the House Republicans referred to the Senate Republicans who have 
spoken out against President Bush's failed policy as ''wimps.'' And it 
begs the question, doesn't the minority leader believe 70 percent of 
Americans and numerous retired generals are wimps as well?

It's a much easier thing to toe the line and keep rubber-stamping the 
President's failed Iraq policy, as many Republicans in this body 
continue to do. It's a lot easier to do that than break from your party 
and the will of our President to take a principled stand for what you 
believe. Those Republicans who are against the President's policies are 
the true patriots.

Mr. Speaker, despite the name calling, Democrats will continue to 
push for a responsible redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq, and we 
hope that some of our Republican colleagues here in the House will join 
with us.
