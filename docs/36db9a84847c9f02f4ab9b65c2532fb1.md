Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the announcement by the Senator from West 
Virginia, chairman of the Appropriations Committee is, I think, good 
news. It is the case that the Appropriations Committee appropriates a 
great deal of money, and the question about oversight is very 
important. The Senator from West Virginia talks about understanding and 
needing to know how the money is spent, where the money is spent.

With nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars having been spent on 
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on terror, there has been 
so much waste, fraud, and abuse, and there has been too little 
oversight. The Senator from West Virginia is showing great foresight 
and courage in saying we are going to provide that oversight. I think 
the Senate and the American people owe him a debt of gratitude for 
launching this effort. I say thank you.

I know the Senator from California is going to speak. When we finish 
the request, to be able to share with our colleagues, I may ask her to 
yield so I might propound a unanimous consent request during her 
presentation.
