`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 30 July 2007`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, many of the best ideas in public policy 
are the simplest. The Children's Health Insurance Program is based on 
one simple and powerful idea--that all children deserve a healthy start 
in life, and that no parents should have to worry about whether they 
can afford to take their child to the doctor when the child is sick. 
CHIP can make the difference between a child starting life burdened 
with disease or a child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow.

I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues Senator Baucus, 
Senator Grassley, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hatch for their 
dedication to making sure that more of America's children have a start 
at a healthy life. They have worked diligently to reach the bipartisan 
bill that we have for us today. But I am not surprised by that.

Throughout the history of CHIP, Members on both sides of the aisle 
have exercised true leadership and set politics aside to focus on the 
needs of children. Senator Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator 
Baucus have long been advocates for the health and well-being of 
children and have been willing to work with those who shared that goal.

My old friend Senator Hatch and I worked together in 1997 to create 
this program that was our shared vision for healthier future for 
American children. This year, we have once again worked together to 
find common ground on covering the children deserve decent, quality 
health care.

As we now consider the future of CHIP it is instructive to look back 
on the history of the program and the circumstances in which it was 
created.

The enactment of Medicaid in 1965 brought decent health care to 
families living in poverty, including children. But it became clearer 
and clearer as the years and the decades passed, that more and more 
children were unable to obtain health care because they lived in 
families whose incomes were too high to qualify for Medicaid but too 
low to afford health insurance.

Finally, in Massachusetts, in the 1990s we agreed that health care 
coverage for children is a necessity and that action needed to be 
taken. John McDonough, executive director of Health Care for All in 
Massachusetts, deserves much of the credit for what came next. His 
pioneering work while he was in the Massachusetts Legislature on 
children's health care led to the passage in 1993 of the State's 
Children's Medical Security Plan, which guaranteed quality health care 
to children in families ineligible for Medicaid and unable to afford 
health insurance.

A year later, Massachusetts expanded eligibility for Medicaid, and 
financed the expansion through a tobacco tax--the same approach we used 
successfully a few years later for CHIP and the same approach that is 
proposed in the bill before us now.

Rhode Island and other States took similar action, and helped create 
a nationwide demand for action by Congress to address the unmet needs 
of vast numbers of children for good health care.

In 1997, Congress acted on that call, and the result was CHIP. 
Senator Hatch and I worked together then--as we have this year--to 
focus on guaranteeing health care to children who need it. Now in every 
State in America and in Puerto Rico, CHIP covers the services that give 
children a healthier start in life--well child care, vaccinations, 
doctor visits, emergency services, and many others.

In its first year 1997, CHIP enrolled nearly a million children, and 
enrollment has grown ever since. An average of 4 million are now 
covered each month, and 6 million are enrolled each year. As a result, 
in the past decade, the percentage of uninsured children has dropped 
from almost 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent today. That reduction is 
significant, but it's obviously far from enough.

CHIP improves the overall quality of life for children fortunate 
enough to have its coverage, by allowing them to get the care they need 
when they need it. They are more likely to have a real doctor and a 
real place to obtain care, and, their parents don't delay seeking care 
when their child needs it. Children on CHIP also have significantly 
more access to preventive care.

Studies also show that CHIP helps to improve children's school 
performance. When children are receiving the health care they need, 
they do better academically, emotionally, physically and socially. CHIP 
helps create children who will be better prepared to contribute to 
America. CHIP all but eliminates the distressing racial and ethnic 
health disparities for the minority children who disproportionately 
depend on it for their coverage.

CHIP's success is even more impressive and important when we realize 
that more and more adults are losing their own insurance coverage, 
because employers reduce it or drop it entirely.

That's why organizations representing children, or the health care 
professionals who serve them, agree that preserving and strengthening 
CHIP is essential to children's health. The American Academy of 
Pediatrics, First Focus, the American Medical Association, the National 
Association of Children's Hospitals and countless other organizations 
dedicated to children all strongly support CHIP.

A statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics puts it this way: 
''Enrollment in SCHIP is associated with improved access, continuity, 
and quality of care, and a reduction in racial/ethnic disparities. As 
pediatricians, we see what happens when children don't receive 
necessary health care services such as immunizations and well-child 
visits. Their overall health suffers and expensive emergency room 
visits increase.''

Today we are here to dedicate ourselves to carrying on the job begun 
by Congress ten years ago, and to make sure that the lifeline of CHIP 
is strengthened and extended to many more children.

Millions of children now eligible for CHIP or Medicaid are not 
enrolled in these programs. Of the nine million uninsured children, 
over two-thirds--more than 6 million--are already eligible for Medicaid 
or CHIP. These programs are there to help them, but these children are 
not receiving that help either because their parents don't know about 
the programs, or because of needless barriers to enrollment.

Think about that number--9 million children in the wealthiest and 
most powerful nation on earth; 9 million children whose only family 
doctor is the hospital emergency room; 9 million children at risk of 
blighted lives and early death because of illnesses that could easily 
be treated if they have a regular source of medical care.

Nine million uninsured children in America isn't just wrong, it is 
outrageous. We need to change it as soon as possible.

We know where the Bush administration stands. The President's 
proposal for CHIP doesn't provide what is needed to cover children who 
are eligible but unenrolled. In fact, the President's proposal is $8 
billion less than what is needed simply to keep children now enrolled 
in CHIP from losing their current coverage--$8 billion short. To make 
matters worse, the President has threatened to veto the Senate bill 
which does the job that needs to be done if we are serious about 
guaranteeing decent health care to children of working families across 
America.

We can't rely on the administration to do what is needed. We in 
Congress have to step up to the plate and renew our commitment to CHIP. 
That is why I am supporting the CHIP bill before us. It is a genuine 
bipartisan compromise. This bill provides coverage to 4 million 
children who would otherwise be uninsured.

It adjusts the financing structure of CHIP so that States that are 
covering their children aren't forced to scramble for additional funds 
from year to year and so that Congress doesn't have to pass a new band-
aid every year to stop the persistent bleeding under the current 
program. Importantly, this bill will not allow States to keep their 
CHIP funds if they aren't doing something to actually cover children.

Equally important, this bill allows each State to cover children at 
income levels that make sense for their state. The bill also supports 
quality improvement and better outreach and enrollment efforts for the 
program. It is a scandal that 6 million children today who are eligible 
for the program are not enrolled in it.



In sum, this bill moves us forward together, Republicans and 
Democrats' to guarantee the children of America the health care they 
need and deserve.

Our priority should be not merely to hold on to the gains of the 
past, but to see that all children have an access to decent coverage. 
Families with greater means should pay a fair share of the coverage. 
But every parent in America should have the opportunity to meet the 
health care needs of their children.

Quality health for children isn't just an interesting option or a 
nice idea. It is not just something we wish we could do. It is an 
obligation. It is something we have to do, and it is something we can 
do today. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure 
this very important legislation is enacted.

I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee and Senators 
Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch, who are putting the children of 
America first and reminding all of us of the responsibility we have for 
the most vulnerable Americans, the children. They have, over a 
considerable period, fashioned legislation that will make an enormous 
difference in not only the health of the neediest children but will 
also reduce the increasing disparity in our Nation. We have tried to 
make some progress in the area of education under the leadership of 
Senators Baucus, Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch. We are going to 
reduce another area of considerable disparity and that is among the 
neediest children in the Nation.

We are over the long term not only going to say we are going to have 
a healthier Nation because we are going to invest in children and make 
sure they will get a healthy start for their future, we are going to be 
a stronger nation because we are a healthier nation. Over a long period 
of time, this is obviously going to have important implications in 
terms of the quality of health not only of the children but of our 
Nation.

This is an enormously important day in the Senate. I thank the 
leadership for giving this the kind of priority in these first weeks 
and months of a new Congress. Senator Reid had indicated this was a 
strong priority. It is an example of where we have had strong 
leadership in our Finance Committee. We have had strong leadership in 
the Budget Committee. There are scarce resources because of our 
involvement in Iraq, limited resources, but nonetheless, under the 
leadership of Senator Conrad and with the strong support of our 
colleagues, we were able to get the commitment that we on this side of 
the aisle and the other side, with those courageous Republicans, are 
saying this is a matter of national priority. This is of national 
importance. We are moving ahead. I thank all of those Senators.

Having listened in our caucus, a number of our colleagues have been 
strong supporters of our leaders on the Finance Committee. I thank my 
colleague and friend John Kerry, among others. I thank all of those for 
bringing us to where we are today.

This is an enormously important occasion. I welcome the opportunity 
to speak to it.

I want to go back over the period when we saw the fashioning of this 
legislation a number of years ago. We have found this was just about 
the time the country was dealing with the issue of the tobacco 
settlement. There was a question about how we could use the resources 
that were going to be gained from the settlement. There was a great 
debate. Many in this body thought we ought to use it all for deficit 
reduction; we ought to give it back to the States and let them make the 
decision. But there were a number of bipartisan Senators saying: No, 
let's make sure that we develop what is an extremely important need, 
and that is health care for children. There was a recognition that in 
1965, with the passage of Medicaid legislation, we tried to take care--
we still don't include all the children who should be there--of the 
poorest of the poor children. We said at that time, as a matter of 
national policy, that we as a country were going to give focus to the 
neediest in our country. It was the Medicaid program for the neediest, 
but a special attention was given to children in the Medicaid 
program. That was matched with dedication and commitment in the 
development of a title I program to deal with education for the 
neediest children in our country. Those went along together, and we are 
coming back to the point where we are doing that under these 
circumstances. So this legislation is important, and I welcome the 
chance to say these words.


I wish to also point out, as others have pointed out, the area of 
need. We know we are making a downpayment on the area of need, but we 
still have a long way to go if we are serious about including all the 
children who are eligible. We need to take care of the neediest 
children in Medicaid.

But then we need to look at those in our economy who are working 
hard, playing by the rules but who cannot afford health care for their 
children. Those are the ones who are reaching $18,000 or $20,000, up to 
$35,000, $38,000, $40,000 a year, depending on what part of the country 
they are in. We find out that those are the individuals and those are 
the families who are the most hard-pressed in any event to afford 
health care. We know the cost of $8,000, $9,000 per family for health 
care. We know the challenges those families are facing, and we know the 
increasing number of those families who are being dropped from health 
insurance.

This program was to try to build upon the Medicaid Program and then 
have the CHIP program going, taking care of all children in this 
country, and to take care of working families--maybe the working poor 
but, more accurately, working families--to make sure their children 
were going to be attended to. This, I believe, is where this 
legislation is targeted. These families are working hard. They are part 
of our American system. They are playing by the rules. But affording 
that protection is not available to them. The CHIP program reaches out 
to them. Some can say: Well, this is an expensive program. I have 
listened to all my colleagues. I have listened to Senator Wyden from 
the State of Oregon speak eloquently about this issue. We need to 
remind ourselves this body is about trying to define priorities. What 
are the Nation's priorities? What is important to us? We are here to 
try to give focus and attention and direction to the areas of greatest 
need.

What our bipartisan leadership today is saying is the area of 
greatest need is the children. In this case, the children are members 
of working families who are virtually unable to get that kind of focus 
and attention and coverage unless they have access to this program.

What are greater priorities than education and health care focused on 
our children? We still know there is more to be done. So I welcome this 
opportunity to speak. I wished to spend a little time speaking on this 
issue. I have referred to how this whole program has reduced health 
disparities among children and also how it has reduced disparities on 
the basis of race in our communities across the country. It was not 
focused on that, but that was the unintended consequence. So this 
legislation is a matter of enormous importance.

Finally, I would say, as to this program, if we are interested in 
educating the children of this country, we have to make sure the 
children can hear the teacher. We have to be able to make sure the 
children are going to be able to see the blackboard. We have to make 
sure the children have proper dental care. I commend, particularly, the 
efforts they have made in dental care for children in this program. It 
is not mandated, but there are resources here to encourage the 
development of these dental programs. We are all aware that dental 
plans are some of the first to leave. We have seen the number of 
children out there with deterioration of their teeth, with all kinds of 
consequences. As we all read in the Washington Post not long ago, some 
children actually lost their lives.

So I thank those who have been a part of this process. I commend all 
of them. This is a very worthwhile effort. I am hopeful it will be very 
successful.
