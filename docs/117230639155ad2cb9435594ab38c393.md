# WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The limited purposes for funding would be: targeted 
counterterrorism operations, protecting United States infrastructure 
and personnel, and training and equipping Iraqi security forces.

This plan gives our troops in the field the resources they need today 
and a strategy that is worthy of their service as they look to 
tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid amendment.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
