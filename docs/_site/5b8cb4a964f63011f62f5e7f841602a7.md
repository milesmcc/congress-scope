`Mr. MEEKS of New York â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. MEEKS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I know of no one in this House, 
whether you be to the left or to the right, who does not believe in our 
troops and our soldiers, who does not respect them and honor them. In 
fact, I think that by having every Member have the opportunity to speak 
on this


floor to talk about their patriotism is exactly what is supposed to 
happen in the people's House.

With that, I am proud to yield 5/1/2/ minutes to a man who was one of 
the leaders in opposition to giving the President the authority to 
unilaterally go into Iraq, a man who is steady and effective on the 
Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from Texas, the Honorable Lloyd 
Doggett
