`Mr. HUNTER â€” 5 December 2007`

Mr. HUNTER. Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I yield myself such time as 
I might consume.

My colleagues, the Republican motion to instruct outlines the 
consequences of a failed state in Iraq and supports a clean war funding 
bill without a date certain to withdraw American troops from Iraq. And 
I would remind my colleagues that the motion to instruct goes to the 
Senate provision which passed by a nearly unanimous vote of 94-3.

Let me explain what it does. The Republican motion to instruct puts 
the House of Representatives on record acknowledging the consequences 
of a vote for a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq and not fully funding 
our troops and their missions. It instructs House conferees to accept 
Senate provision 1536 which states that it is the sense of Congress 
that a failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for Islamic 
radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are determined to 
attack the United States and its allies.

The provision also notes that a failed state in Iraq could lead to a 
broader regional conflict involving Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria and 
Turkey, and would lead to massive humanitarian suffering, including 
widespread ethnic cleansing and countless refugees and internally 
displaced persons, many of whom will be tortured and killed for having 
assisted coalition forces.

Senate provision 1536 concludes by stating that the Congress should 
commit itself to a strategy that will not leave a failed state in Iraq 
and should not pass legislation that will undermine our military's 
ability to prevent a failed state in Iraq.

Now, going to the aspect of the authorization of additional 
appropriations for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
Freedom, my colleagues, these are the funds that are essential in this 
ongoing war in two theaters, to keep the funds going, to keep the money 
going to operate our military forces so that we don't end up having to 
reach into the cash register and pull money out for ammunition, pull 
money out for training exercise, pull money out for important ongoing 
operations and activities here that are in fact assisting the war-
fighting effort.

One example of those, of course, is the Joint Improvised Explosive 
Device Defeat Organization, JIEDDO, which has a complicated name but 
very simply means developing capabilities against roadside bombs. 
That's a command that we set up to defeat IEDs in Iraq, and we are told 
now that it will run out of money within the next hundred days and may 
not have enough money to fund all urgent initiatives from Iraq and 
Afghanistan during that time.



I would remind my colleagues that the roadside bombs are being seen 
on a more widespread basis in Afghanistan now. There has been an 
understanding by the insurgents, by the Taliban, by al Qaeda in 
Afghanistan that those, in fact, are a deadly and effective system. And 
it makes no sense whatsoever for us to shortchange the accounts that 
are going toward the defeat of roadside bombs.

Another point that I would make is that we have been notified that 
the Pentagon will soon be required to lay off 100,000 civilian workers. 
Many of those workers are working on important projects that go to the 
heart of our ability to win in the war-fighting theaters. So this is a 
major, major mistake for this Congress, in the middle of an operation 
in two war-fighting theaters, to shortchange these accounts which will 
result in the military having to reach in the cash register, take money 
out of other accounts in the hope that at some point in the future next 
year we are going to be able to make up that money. So whatever your 
position on our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, whether you think 
we should be there or not be there, every Member of this body says time 
and again, ''We support the troops.''

Madam Speaker, stripping this funding off, which is what we will do 
if we don't pass this motion to instruct, is very clearly a disservice 
to these 157,000 plus troops in Iraq and the 22,000 plus American 
troops fighting in Afghanistan right now.

I reserve the balance of my time.
