Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, we now know what the President's plan 
for Iraq is: it's just stay. Stay for how long? He doesn't know. We 
don't really have a plan, but we do know that we have not succeeded in 
Iraq. In spite of the efforts of our brave soldiers, in spite of the 10 
to $12 billion a month that we have spent, in spite of all of our 
efforts, we have not succeeded.

Now, if you look at the independent nonpartisan reports on Iraq, you 
find that 100,000 Iraqis are moving from their communities every single 
month. Why would 100,000 Iraqis move from their homes, from their 
schools, from their lives? They're moving because they're not safe.

We have militia roaming around. We've had ethnic cleansing in 
Baghdad. If you look at the maps of the neighborhoods, 2005 and now 
2007, you realize that the Iraqis are not living together any longer. 
We have ethnic cleansing.

We also know that the Iraqi Parliament, more than half of the Iraqi 
Parliament, signed a petition asking Americans to go home.

We also know that the Iraqis wanted to take a 2-month vacation in 
140-degree weather while our troops were struggling. It is time to 
bring our troops home and look at American benchmarks.
