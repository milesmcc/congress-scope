Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield myself such time as 
I may consume.

I'm pleased that in this bill overly prescriptive reporting and 
related requirements have been replaced by more appropriate and time-
limited provisions for Pakistan strategy reports, for accountability, 
and for monitoring of assistance.

Robust accountability provisions are included and are vital to 
reassure the American taxpayer that their moneys are being well-spent, 
and this is particularly the case for Pakistan, where many Pakistanis 
and groups, like Transparency International, are deeply concerned about 
the integrity of high-level officials in that country.

Mr. Speaker, of all the foreign policy challenges facing the United 
States, stabilizing and transforming and reforming Pakistan may be one 
of the most daunting. The good news is that leaders in Islamabad have 
shown increased willingness to confront those militants who have 
targeted the Pakistani State from bases in the Northwest Frontier 
Province and from South Waziristan.

A number of militant leaders have been killed or captured, most 
prominently the leader of the Pakistani Taliban.

SWAT and other conflict-affected areas of the Northwest Frontier 
Province are stabilizing. Although some progress has been achieved, 
much remains to be done.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are part of a wider theater of operations 
and, despite important differences, must be considered jointly, as the 
administration itself suggested following the conclusion of a 
comprehensive strategic review of Af-Pak policy this March.

Suddenly, however, President Obama has apparently decided to rethink 
the entire strategy in Afghanistan after his hand-picked new commander 
there, General Stanley McChrystal, warned that the war could be lost if 
he doesn't get more troops in the next 12 months.

The stunning magnitude of this reversal was highlighted in an 
article, an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal of September 22.

The author Leslie Gelb, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, 
columnist and president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, 
wrote:

''I'm lost on President Barack Obama's Afghanistan policy, along with 
most of Congress and the U.S. military. Not quite 8 months ago, Mr. 
Obama pledged to 'defeat' al Qaeda in Afghanistan by transforming that 
country's political and economic infrastructure, by training Afghan 
forces and adding 21,000 U.S. forces for starters.

''He proclaimed Afghanistan's strategic centrality to prevent Muslim 
extremism from taking over Pakistan, an even more vital Nation because 
of its nuclear weapons. And a mere 3 weeks ago, he punctuated his 
commitments by proclaiming that Afghanistan is a 'war of necessity,' 
not one of choice. White House spokesmen reinforced this by promising 
that the President would 'fully resource' the war.''

Leslie Gelb goes on, ''Yet less than 1 week ago, Mr. Obama said the 
following about troop increases: 'I'm going to take a very deliberative 
process in making those decisions. There is no immediate decision 
pending on resources, because one of the things that I'm absolutely 
clear about is you have to get the strategy right and then make a 
determination about resources.' ''

Gelb points out, ''Americans are now confused and caught somewhere 
between remembering the President's insistence on Afghanistan's 
importance to U.S. security and rapidly rising pressure from his party 
to bring the troops home.''

Mr. Speaker, if the U.S. is going to prevail against al Qaeda and the 
Taliban and win in Afghanistan, the administration must take immediate 
steps to fully implement the strategy without any further vacillating 
or delays.

Thus, while today we prepare to vote strongly in support of S. 1707 
and, in the words of Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen, ''strongly 
signal to the Pakistani people our long-term commitment to partnering 
with them to combat terrorism and extremism,'' I must ask: What about 
Afghanistan? How much more time will pass before General McChrystal is 
provided the resources and the personnel that he deems necessary to 
succeed in Afghanistan?

As for Pakistan, we join with the executive branch on a bipartisan 
basis to support policies that will help our friends there transform 
their country into a stable and prosperous democracy that will support 
U.S. interests in the region, that opposes militancy within and outside 
its borders, commits to a secure Afghanistan, and will maintain 
responsible controls over its nuclear weapons capability.

This bill helps us to achieve those objectives, and I urge its 
support.

And with that, I yield back the balance of our time.
