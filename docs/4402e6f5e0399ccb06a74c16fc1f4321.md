Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I had a 1-minute prepared to talk about the 
debate on Iraq, but I think what is more appropriate at this time is to 
talk about what this House of Representatives has experienced since 
January 4.

The doors of this House of Representatives, indeed this country, have 
been opened to thought, perspectives and issues that have been stifled 
for the last 12 years. I want to thank the Speaker for her leadership, 
for the leadership of the Democratic Party, and the chairman and what 
they brought forward. The first woman ever elected Speaker in this 
country's history, the first African American to be elected Clerk. 
History is being made with the issues coming forth from middle America 
for people who are in need, for the future of this planet.

I want to thank the Speaker. America is going in the right direction.
