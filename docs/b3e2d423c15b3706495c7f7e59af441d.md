Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Taiwan's 
National Day, also known as Double Ten Day. This day marks a special 
moment in Taiwan's history. It was the start of the Wuchang uprising 
that led to the overthrow of the Ching dynasty and laid the foundation 
for the establishment of the first democracy founded in Asia.

Taiwan has been a long time supporter and ally of the United States 
and its people. Taiwan continues to be our ally in the war on terrorism 
by cooperating with humanitarian assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
They have shown generosity and compassion by contributing to the Twin 
Towers Fund and Pentagon Memorial Fund, and now to the victims of 
Hurricane Katrina. Continually, Taiwan has proved to be a true ally to 
the people of the United States.

In sharing the same beliefs in freedom and democracy, we can further 
our ties by protecting these ideas in our countries and throughout the 
world. May this year's celebration be one of the most memorable and 
enjoyed in Taiwan's history.
