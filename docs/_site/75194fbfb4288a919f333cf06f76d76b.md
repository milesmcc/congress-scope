Mr. ELLISON. Thank you, Congresswoman.

Now we are really honored to have one of our great leaders in our 
class, Mr. Patrick Murphy, who is a distinguished veteran of our Armed 
Forces, who I believe is the only combat veteran of the Iraq conflict, 
to tell some very, very heart-rending and very clear stories, which are 
true, about the meaning of our Nation's effort for a just, safe, but 
orderly withdrawal from this conflict.

I would like to switch it over to Congressman Murphy for a moment 
from the great state of Pennsylvania.
