# RECIPE FOR DISASTER

Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the proposed 
stimulus legislation. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, never have so 
few spent so much so quickly to do so little. The stimulus bill, now 
totaling a staggering $789 billion, does little to aid our ailing 
economy. Let me put $789 billion in perspective. That is more money 
than we spent in 5 years of war in Iraq. That is more money than we 
spent in Afghanistan. Seven hundred eight-nine billion dollars is 
nearly as much as the total of all United States currency currently 
circulating worldwide.

This spending bill creates some 30 new Federal programs and agencies, 
growing government to the largest size ever. In fact, the spending in 
this bill is larger than the budgets of most governments and nearly 
twice the size of the oil-rich economy of Saudi Arabia. What we need is 
more money in the hands of those who pay taxes, create jobs and invest 
in our economy. Instead, we're giving billions to those who will grow 
government and raise taxes.

Madam Speaker, this is not a road to recovery. This is a recipe for 
disaster.
