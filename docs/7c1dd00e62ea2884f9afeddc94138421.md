Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of our troops, and 
I want to underscore that. But I also want to make clear that I am 
opposed to the war in Iraq. Our service men and women are proudly 
serving our country. More than 3,063 of our sons and daughters, 
including 13 from the 32nd Congressional District that I represent, 
have given their lives.

This war, as you know, has cost taxpayers $387 billion so far, and an 
additional $100 billion to $130 billion is going to be requested by 
this President. There is no plan to secure the peace. There is no 
accountability for companies like Halliburton that have been found to 
make more than $1.4 billion in unreasonable and unsupported billing 
charges, and our veterans lack the support needed and deserved.

We need a plan that ensures that there are no permanent U.S. military 
bases in Iraq, and not a plan to increase the buildup. We need a plan 
which investigates and punishes companies engaged in war profiteering 
and fraud and a plan to redeploy our servicemen and women. We need to 
find a political solution.
