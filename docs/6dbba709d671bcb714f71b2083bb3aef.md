# COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HYPOCRISY

`Mr. PITTS â€” 26 September 2007`

Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, Columbia University defended the Iranian 
President's speech by invoking the right to free speech and speaking 
about open exchange of ideas.

None of what he said on Monday could be construed as such. He dodged 
questions about his Holocaust denial. He ignored questions about his 
country's role in the death of American soldiers in Iraq.

This same university does not allow our military's ROTC program on 
campus because they believe the military's ''don't ask, don't tell 
policy'' is discriminatory toward homosexuals.

But if Columbia is that concerned about defending homosexuals, why 
did they let this dictator on campus? His regime doesn't discriminate 
against gays; it executes them. More than 400 homosexuals so far 
executed like this.

Columbia University provided Mr. Ahmadinejad a sense of legitimacy 
and a forum that he will no doubt use to his advantage at home and 
abroad.

It is unfortunate they don't provide the same to the fine young men 
and women of our armed services.
