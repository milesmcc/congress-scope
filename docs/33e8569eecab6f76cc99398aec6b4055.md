`Ms. GRANGER â€” 23 June 2009`

---


Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, pursuant to the House Republican 
standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information 
regarding earmarks I received as part of


H.R. 2647, The National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2010.

Requesting Member: Congresswoman Kay Granger

Priority Name: UH-60 Rewiring Program--Army National Guard

Authorized Amount: $5 million

Account: Aircraft procurement--Army

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: InterConnect Wiring

Address of Requesting Entity: 5024 West Vickery Blvd, Fort Worth, TX 
76107

Description of Request: The use of taxpayer funds is justified 
because the UH-60 rewiring program is a vital recapitalization of 
critical aviation assets within the Army National Guard. Replacing 
Kapton insulation used in aircraft wiring harnesses during 
modification, work order and retrofit is a key component. After many 
years of use, Kapton insulation becomes old and brittle and can lead to 
wet or dry arcing. Arcing can lead to intermittent or catastrophic 
failures. The only solution for this potential problem is to replace 
the wiring harnesses with new wiring harnesses.

Priority Name: Mobile Firing Range for TXARNG

Authorized Amount: $1.5 million

Account: Training Devices, Nonsystem

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Texas Army National Guard

Address of Requesting Entity: PO Box 5218, Austin, TX 78763

Description of Request: This funding will be used to procure a Mobile 
Firing Range for the Texas National Guard. The use of taxpayer funds is 
justified because the TXANG currently does not have access to any 
indoor ranges that can be used to fire the M16/M4 which is the current 
armament for 90% of the soldiers within the Texas Army National Guard. 
The Mobile Firing Range will allow soldiers to train with their 
assigned weapons at home station. The value added is soldiers can train 
more than once a year during their annual qualification. The ability to 
have mobile ranges allows for them to be collocated as needed to 
support deploying unit needs. This system is a training and force 
multiplier due to the negation of travel and lodging, and staging 
needed when conducting this training on a military facility.

Priority Name: Field Deployable Hologram Production System

Authorized Amount: $4.8 million

Account: Research, Development, Test And Evaluation, Army

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Zebra Imaging

Address of Requesting Entity: 9801 Metric Boulevard, Suite 200, 
Austin, TX 78759

Description of Request: The Enhanced Holographic Imager (EHI) program 
is completing development of a compact production unit that produces 3D 
holographic imagery for mission planning and intelligence purposes for 
U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The use of taxpayer funds is 
justified because the Army now requests a self-contained, field-
deployable EHI production system to accelerate imagery delivery to 
combat forces. This authorization will be used to fund an EHI post-
processing unit and a transportable production facility, with the 
completed Field Deployable Hologram Production System operational 
within a year of receiving funding.

Priority Name: Replace Joint Base Communications Building

Authorized Amount: $6.17 million

Account: Military Construction

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: NAS JRB FT WORTH

Address of Requesting Entity: NAS JRB FT WORTH, Fort Worth, TX 76127

Description of Request: This funding will be used to provide adequate 
facilities to house and support the communications hub for NAS JRB Fort 
Worth. The terminal/switch room in this facility provides the single 
connecting point for all on-base communications and their interface to 
all off-base systems. The Navy and the Air Force have personnel in this 
facility and manage communications systems for all of the tenant 
commands. The base has seen increases in communication volume due to 
links with off-site data systems and new tenants (e.g. 8th Marine Corps 
Division Office), as well as increased information security 
requirements. The use of taxpayer funds is justified because these 
conditions force increases in the amount and complexity of the 
equipment. Existing space will not accommodate growth requirements for 
the terminal/switch room, threatening a loss in communication 
functionality base-wide.
