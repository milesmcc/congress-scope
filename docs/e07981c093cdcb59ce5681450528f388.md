Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, by overwhelming majorities, the American 
people are demanding a change of course in Iraq. After 5 years of a 
failed Bush administration strategy to bring peace and stability to 
Iraq, the American people are fed up with the way that is jeopardizing 
our national security, our military strength and our Nation's fiscal 
future.

The American people no longer listen to the President when he says 
the situation in Iraq is improving. And they received more proof last 
week that the President's new way forward strategy, the so-called 
surge, is only inflaming Iraq's civil war. Casualties among U.S. forces 
have surged and the political process in Iraq has halted. The 
President's policy has produced few results on the ground, and yet he 
is asking both the American people and the Congress for more time.

Mr. Speaker, President Bush has had 4 years to make his policy work, 
and the situation is not getting any better. It's time that we get back 
to fighting the real global war on terror so that al Qaeda does not 
continue to gain strength in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Senate has a 
chance today to follow our lead, listen to the American people and 
begin bringing our troops home.
