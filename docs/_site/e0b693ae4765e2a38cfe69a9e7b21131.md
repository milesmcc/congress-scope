Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, time is running out to send our troops 
the funds and resources they need to continue their critical mission in 
Iraq.

The new congressional majority ensured the veto the President 
promised by submitting a supplemental loaded with pork and a timeline 
for retreat on our commanders in the field. Now it's time to pass a 
clean supplemental.

The National Intelligence Estimate released in January warned of the 
perils of an early troop withdrawal, stating: ''If coalition forces 
were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that 
this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale 
and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq.''

Many on the other side of the aisle urge Congress to heed the words 
in this document; yet they stare blindly at it as they force a strategy 
of retreat and defeat. This leads me to believe that the new 
congressional majority would rather use our troops to make a political 
statement than work in bipartisan fashion to give our brave men and 
women in uniform the funding they need.

It's time we vote on a clean supplemental and give the troops the 
support they deserve.
