Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, some of the Democratic 
leadership have declared it the job of Congress to micromanage the war 
in Iraq. Yet we learn today that the Speaker of the House has refused 
to be seen face-to-face with the very military commanders whose hands 
will be tied by the Democrat war funding bill.

This latest insult to our troops should come as no surprise as others 
in the Democratic leadership have declared the war lost despite our 
military commanders' statements to the contrary, and before General 
Petraeus has gotten the reinforcements he has requested. His 
reinforcement hasn't even been fully implemented before Congressional 
leaders have called it a failure.

I urge my colleagues to insist on a funding bill that does not give 
our enemies a date for our surrender. I believe our soldiers when they 
say the war is not lost, and we must give our military the resources it 
needs to win. Language of surrender is inappropriate with troops in the 
field and reinforces the perceptions of our enemies.
