Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Obey, my 
good friend, for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, I know there are a lot of good things in this bill, but 
there is one bad thing. Billions of dollars, more billions of dollars 
to fund the war in Iraq.

The best present, the best gift we could give to our young men and 
women in the military during this season of peace and goodwill would be 
to bring this madness to an end and bring our young people home, and 
bring them home now. This war was ill-conceived from the beginning. It 
is a war of choice and not a war of necessity. The time is long 
overdue. Now is the time to bring this madness to an end.

I said it before and I will say it again. In good conscience, I will 
not vote for one dollar or one dime to continue this war. The American 
people are sick and tired of this war and I am tired and sick of this 
war. It is time to give peace a chance.
