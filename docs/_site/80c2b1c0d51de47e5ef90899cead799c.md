Mr. DEAL of Georgia. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I have the honor today to rise in support of the memory 
of Army Sergeant Jason Robert Harkins by dedicating the United States 
Post Office located in Cleveland, Georgia, as the Sgt. Jason Harkins 
Post Office Building.

I want to thank Mr. Davis and the committee for bringing this bill to 
the floor. It is, indeed, a sad but true honor to be able to recognize 
Sergeant Harkins. He was a member of the United States Army 5th 
Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division 
of Fort Lewis, Washington.

While serving his second tour of duty in Iraq, 25-year-old Sergeant 
Harkins was killed by a roadside bomb along with five other members of 
his platoon during combat operations in Baqubah, Iraq. For his valiant 
service to our country, Sergeant Harkins' family was presented the 
Bronze Star award and the Purple Heart.

Born in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Sergeant Harkins was a 1999 graduate 
of Habersham Central High School in Georgia, served 3 years in the 
United States Army Reserves and was currently serving with the Stryker 
Brigade located at Fort Lewis when the attack occurred.

Sergeant Jason Harkins is survived by his wife, Emily Renee Cook 
Harkins of Tacoma, Washington, formerly of Gadsden, Alabama; mother and 
stepfather, Nancy and Allen Fritchey; father and stepmother, Bobby and 
April Harkins; brothers Matthew and Daniel Harkins; as well as 
stepsisters Katie, Clara, Nicole, Jennifer and Emily; stepbrother 
Scott; and several nieces and nephews.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to pay tribute to Sergeant 
Harkins and to join my constituents of Cleveland, Georgia, in naming 
the Sgt. Jason Harkins Post Office Building. This honor will serve as a 
lasting reminder of his courage, valor, and the ultimate sacrifice 
which he paid for our country.

Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to include for the Record a 
copy of a letter from Mayor Donald Stanley of the City of Cleveland, as 
well as a letter from the White County Board of Commissioners 
requesting and supporting this designation.























 Board of Commissioners,






















White County, Georgia,

















Cleveland, GA, September 26, 2007.


 Hon. Nathan Deal,


 Ninth District Representative,


 Gainesville, GA.



 Dear Congressman Deal: As you are aware, recently our 


 community suffered a tremendous loss. Sgt. Jason Harkins lost 


 his life at 25 years of age by a roadside bomb while serving 


 in Iraq. Weeks before his death, Sgt. Harkins went into a 


 danger zone and saved the life of one of his soldiers. A 


 bullet actually struck him in his helmet during the rescue. 


 For this act of valor, his family was presented the Bronze 


 Star Award and Purple Heart.



 Jason gave the ultimate price for our community and nation. 


 As a memorial to him, we support the Postmaster Louise S. 


 Nix's request to pursue the act of having our postal facility 


 in Cleveland renamed the Jason Harkins Postal Facility. As we 


 understand it, this would in no way change the addresses of 


 residents, but would show respect and memorialize a White 


 County native who died for his country.



 We would appreciate any assistance you could give to this 


 action.





 Sincerely,


 Chris R. Nonnemaker,



 Chairman.
