Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, in my remarks in support of H.R. 1700, the 
''COPS Improvements Act of 2007,'' I refer to amended language in the 
bill that would have required COPS grant recipients participating in 
the ''Troops-to-Cops'' program to give special hiring preference to 
former members of the Armed Forces who served in Operation Enduring 
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. I first introduced this provision 
in an amendment during the Judiciary Committee markup of H.R. 1700. I 
withdrew that amendment with the understanding that, after working with 
Ranking Member Lamar Smith upon the committee's urging to craft 
mutually agreeable language, this provision was to be included in the 
final version of H.R. 1700.

Through what I believe to have been an inadvertent omission, the 
hiring preference for veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and 
Operation Iraqi Freedom was not included in the final version of H.R. 
1700 that has been presented to the full House of Representatives. It 
is my understanding that the language will be added either in the 
Senate bill or at conference and, therefore, will be contained in the 
bill sent to the President for his signature.
