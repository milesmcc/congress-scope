Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, on May 10, 2008, the Hoosier state lost 
another of its brave young men. Army SGT Joseph A. Ford died from 
injuries sustained when his vehicle rolled over in Al Asad, Iraq. SFT 
Ford was from Knox, Indiana, but had been living in New Albany with his 
wife, Karen Christina Grimm Ford. SGT Ford deployed to Iraq with more 
than 3,000 members of the Indiana National Guard's 76th Infantry 
Battalion Combat Team.

SGT Ford was known as an intellectual among his peers and comrades. 
He was drawn to military and ancient history, often carrying a book 
along with him. While in high school, Ford was a member of the fencing 
club. He choreographed the sword fight scenes in his school's 
production of ''The Three Musketeers.''

SGT Joseph A. Ford is an American hero. His sacrifice for our Nation, 
and our State, deserves our deepest respect and most heartfelt thanks. 
I, along with the towns of Knox and New Albany, mourn the loss of 
Joseph. His mends and family are in my prayers.
