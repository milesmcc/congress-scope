`Mr. MURPHY of New York â€” 20 May 2009`

Mr. MURPHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a very sad 
duty of reporting the tragic passing of Roslyn Littman Schulte, who was 
taken from us by a roadside bomb just north of Kabul earlier today 
while serving our country.

Roslyn Schulte was a first lieutenant in the United States Air Force, 
an intelligence officer, and the younger sister of my chief of staff, 
and a great friend of this body, Todd Schulte.

Roslyn Schulte was born March 18, 1984, in St. Louis, Missouri. She 
was a graduate of John Burroughs High School in St. Louis, and attended 
the United States Air Force Academy, where she graduated in 2006. She 
was deployed to Afghanistan on February 18 of this year.

Like so many patriotic Americans, Lieutenant Schulte was willing to 
give her life in service to all of us and to her country. The 
expression of our gratitude to her is beyond words.

Roslyn is survived by her parents, Bob and Suzy Schulte, and her 
brother, Todd. The thoughts and prayers of a grateful Nation are with 
the Schulte family and with Roslyn's fellow troops and friends at this 
difficult time.

As we stand on this floor and debate the profound issues of our 
times, let us never forget the true cost of the freedoms that we so 
often take for granted.
