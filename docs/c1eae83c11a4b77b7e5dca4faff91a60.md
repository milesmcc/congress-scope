Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I congratulate the 
gentleman's dexterity, on his ability to go 180 degrees opposite on his 
argument mid-amendment.

He started out saying we can't do this because it will jeopardize the 
FHA. We point out that in the bill that couldn't happen. This bill says 
this money cannot be used if it would in any way jeopardize an FHA 
situation. So he says okay, let's take the surplus and put it into the 
regular budget. That is a debate. Do we take surplus and put it into 
the budget to detract from other spending? I don't think so. I guess 
the question is this. If you take out an FHA mortgage and get mortgage 
insurance, and if our bill doesn't pass, this administration will raise 
that fee to make more money, should that go to the war in Iraq and for 
contractors in Iraq who are wasting money? Or should it go to build 
affordable housing in our cities, because that is where the money is 
going. The money is not going to reduce the deficit; it is going to be 
wasted elsewhere.

What we say is this. We should be building affordable housing. Some 
Members say don't give money to the States. No, I think that is a very 
good way to go. I think the States and the localities are best able to 
respond, and I hope the amendment is defeated.
