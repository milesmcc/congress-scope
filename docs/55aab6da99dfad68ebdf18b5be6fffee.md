Mr. HUNTER. I am going to yield to Mr. Thornberry, but first let me 
just say this. I respect the gentleman who just made the statement who 
has been in Iraq. But my son was in Iraq, also, and on two missions, 
two tours, and Afghanistan. And one important fact that I think comes 
out when you talk to folks who have been there is the exigency of the 
battlefield. That is the


need to do things quickly, to be creative, to be able to move quickly 
to save the lives of your comrades and to carry out your mission.

Now, let's think about this. You have to videotape interrogations. 
What happens if you have got people coming in, moving in a pincer 
movement against a particular area, maybe some buildings, maybe you 
have got some machine gun fire, and you have been hitting IEDs, and you 
capture somebody and you have got people in movement. And you have to 
bring up then the video cameras to interrogate before you can have a 
successful interrogation. And what if you don't have video cameras? You 
are going to have people who are deterred from being able to do that 
because they are going to be worried that somehow they are going to be 
found in violation of the rules.

Now, we have got a letter here from the Under Secretary of Defense 
who says that the Defense Department very strongly opposes this 
requirement to video record all intelligence interrogations. They say: 
This requirement runs contrary to sound Defense Department policy, 
which relies upon careful selection and empowerment of the chain of 
command to execute the mission. Currently, commanders video record 
interrogations only after determining that the environment is conducive 
and the recordings will add value to the mission.

I might add that if you have interrogations, especially if you have 
got special operators who are out among the population and you lose one 
of the recordings, then you expose them to enormous risk.

So the idea of making this not discretionary and mandating it I think 
doesn't make a lot of sense.
