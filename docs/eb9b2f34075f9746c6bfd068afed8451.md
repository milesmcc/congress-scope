Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentlewoman.

Madam Speaker, in a week when our hearts are heavy with the weight of 
yesterday's tragedy at Virginia Tech and the anniversary of the 
shooting at Columbine High School, it is important that we also 
remember America's tremendous capacity for selfless acts of goodness.

I refer to a spirit that sets aside superficial desires in favor of 
the needs of our fellow human beings, a spirit that shows our Nation at 
its best, the spirit honored during this National Volunteer Week.

Last year, as has been said, more than a quarter of Americans 
dedicated their time to bettering their communities, inspiring by 
example and improving lives.

I am fortunate to represent a community in which passionate 
leadership and dedicated citizens have enacted community service 
projects on every scale throughout Louisville. Just during our recent 
recess, I think a picture has been painted of what people are willing 
to give to others. On one morning I joined more than 3,000 volunteers 
of all ages as we embarked on a project to clean up across the 
communities in furthering the Operation Brightside movement. In 
visiting schools, we saw parents and grandparents volunteering their 
time to help kids. In hospital after hospital we saw people of all ages 
helping our sick. And also in one of the most moving experiences during 
my recess, two first grade classes at Coleridge-Taylor Elementary had 
decided to help the troops in Iraq. They went out and collected 200 
pounds of candy to send overseas. These were sixth graders who saw the 
need to give of their time and energy to help others. It was truly an 
inspirational moment.

The great thing about volunteering is it is a way that you 
demonstrate your citizenship. We talk a lot about patriotism and 
citizenship in this body, but nothing demonstrates citizenship more 
than your willingness to spend your dear time to help others.

I hope this week does not stand alone in honoring our generous 
citizens and organizations. And I urge every citizen to join them in 
discovering the rewards that volunteering has to offer.

I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 293.
