Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, As a result of Republican obstructionism 
and the President's threats to veto our Democratic Congress' new 
investments in health, the environment and infrastructure, Congress is 
being forced to pass a resolution to keep the government operating 
beyond next week's end of the fiscal year. Unfortunately, this bill 
included money to continue funding the war in Iraq. I have pledged: 
''not another dime for the war,'' and voted ''no.'' I will continue to 
vote against any appropriations bill that continues military operations 
in Iraq.

At the same time, the motion to condemn Moveon.org was both 
irrelevant and hypocritical. It was irrelevant in that it had nothing 
to do with the underlying bill and hypocritical because the Republicans 
have tolerated, and in some cases encouraged, some of the most savage 
Swift-boating of candidates and individuals without ever raising a 
voice in protest.

People have deep concerns about this administration and they have the 
right to question the testimony General Petraeus gave before Congress. 
The twisted factual basis for some of his statements, which charitably 
can only be deemed convoluted, has been made clear in numerous 
independent press accounts. I voted ''no,'' choosing not to be a part 
of the irrelevance and hypocrisy.
