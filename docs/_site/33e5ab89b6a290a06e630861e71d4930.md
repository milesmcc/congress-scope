Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.

I want to talk about what my friend from California just mentioned. 
And I want to just simply say that I think that the gentleman from 
California is truly a gentleman, and I enjoy the time we've spent 
together. But there are just a few things I think need to be corrected.

Number one, the gentleman mentioned that over the last 6 years, the 
Republicans, when they were in charge, squandered the opportunity, lost 
the credibility. Well, guess what? It's only taken 6 months for this 
majority, maybe 6 years for the former majority; 6 months, and this 
majority has turned their back on earmark reforms. Six months into the 
new majority, and this majority has turned this thing upside down.

What do I mean when I say that, Mr. Chairman?

Let me just quote our current Speaker, on December 14, 2006, ''We 
will bring transparency and openness to the budget process and to the 
use of earmarks, and we will give the American people the leadership 
they deserve.''

What happened?

Well, a number of things happened. Under the Republican majority, 
earmarks got out of control. Under the Republican majority, waste 
occurred. Let me be the first one to say that.

So what happened?

In the last session, Republicans changed the rules. We said, if 
you're going to have an earmark, a pork-barrel project, Number one, 
we've got to see it. It's got to be in the bill. A Member has to have 
their name attached to it, so they have to defend it.

But most importantly, the American people need to see this, and it 
needs to be in the bill as it comes to the House floor, as it goes to 
the Senate Chamber, so that the American people have time to look at 
it, so that transparency and sunlight can bring accountability to the 
process, and so that we, as the people's Representatives, each and 
every one of us, representing 670,459 people, can have judgment, can 
vote on it. That's transparency. That's accountability. It happened 
late in our majority, but it happened.

What did the Democrats do as they took over the majority?

To their credit, Mr. Chairman, they extended, enhanced and improved 
upon these rules. So I would, at this moment, like to give some 
bipartisan credit to the fact that we negotiated these earmark reforms 
in the last session, and Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats, to their 
credit, carried them over and made them better.

Where are we 6 months later? Where are we 6 months into this new 
majority? We went three steps forward, and now we went six steps 
backwards.

Mr. Chairman, what are we doing?

No transparency, no earmarks in these bills, no opportunity for the 
American people, the public, to see what's in this legislation. All we 
have in these bills are big slush funds, a $5.9 billion slush fund in 
the bill that's coming up next, a $20 billion earmark slush fund in the 
bill coming after that.

What does that mean?

They're putting billions and billions of dollars of fiscal space of a 
general earmark in these bills, and they're simply saying, this money 
will be earmarked afterwards, when I, the chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee decide to put this money in to go toward pet 
projects, pet constituencies, at my choosing, at my scrutinizing, after 
Congress has the ability to consider these things on their own merits.

Is that transparency? Is that accountability? Absolutely not, Mr. 
Chairman.

They have gone backwards, back on their word, back from bringing 
transparency and accountability to Congress.

So let me just say for the record, both parties have messed this up. 
Both majorities have seen the light, and this majority is going 
backwards on this. That is what this is all about.

We recognize we've got to have more transparency and accountability 
in the way we spend taxpayer dollars. That's one of the problems we 
have. The other problem is this idea that we can just spend our way 
into prosperity, this idea that we can just spend more and more and 
more money, and all things wrong in America will be fixed. If only we 
take more money out of people's paychecks, bring them up here to 
Washington and spend their money, every problem can be solved.

This is the problem we have at a basic philosophical level. Here is 
where we are just 6 months into this new majority.

The President gave us a budget. His budget increased spending across 
all levels of government. His budget increased discretionary spending. 
Well, what happened since that budget came? Six billion new dollars in 
February in the omnibus appropriation. Then, just last month, $17 
billion in new spending of unrelated, nonrequested spending in an 
emergency appropriation bill to go to funding the troops in Iraq, $17 
billion that has nothing to do with Iraq.


And now, $21 billion in more spending. $43 billion out the window, out 
the door in new spending in just 6 months.

How do you balance the budget, Mr. Chairman? You balance it by 
controlling spending.
