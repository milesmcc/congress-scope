Mr. DOGGETT. Yesterday's Senate vote for another blank check to 
President Bush for the Iraq war was as wrongheaded as the Senate's 
original 2002 blessing for that invasion, despite the strong opposition 
of most House Democrats.

Of course the Iraq surge has worked. Not the surge in Iraq. That 
surge has failed miserably, failed to achieve any of the political 
objectives, the benchmarks that the President set himself. No. The only 
surge that has worked is the propaganda surge here in Washington. 
Hemorrhaging more dollars and more blood into the sands of Iraq is not 
a formula for achieving success.

The taxpayers' price for Iraq is $3 billion every week of every month 
of the year. Take all the money that is used to research and seek a 
cure for cancer at the National Institute for Cancer, that is how much 
money we spend in Iraq in 2 weeks. But whether deaths are up or deaths 
are down, ''the Administration's consistent response is the troops 
cannot come home.''

We need to learn from the courage displayed by our troops. My 
colleagues in this House need to learn from that courage and vote to 
limit any more funding in this war to a fully funded, safe, 
redeployment from Iraq that begins today.
