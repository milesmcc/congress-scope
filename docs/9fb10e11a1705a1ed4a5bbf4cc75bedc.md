Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me acknowledge the very 
hard work that was accomplished by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
House, Chairman Berman and Subcommittee Chairman Ackerman, and say that 
we did the right thing today. By passing the Pakistan Enduring 
Assistance and Cooperation Enhancement Act, the American people have 
made a few more steps toward their own personal security, their own 
ensuring of the security of the homeland, and recognizing a long-
standing relationship that has had, frankly, its hills and valleys.

Many of us don't know the history of other countries, and obviously 
we have our own wonderful history. But, interestingly enough, when 
Pakistan was founded by a person named Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it was 
founded on democratic principles, and we have had a longstanding 50-
plus year relationship, although it has been uneven.

So today we have restored that relationship, and I hope Pakistani 
Americans and their own Embassy that is here representing Pakistan 
really realizes that we made a strong statement today for the respect 
and for the relationship of this nation.

We have in essence put together a document that would enhance 
significantly economic, social and democratic assistance for Pakistan. 
We have recognized the importance of public diplomacy and engagement. 
That is a reinvestment, a reordering of the relationship.

We have also recognized the importance of a regional process or 
coordination between Afghanistan, India and Bangladesh, recognizing 
that this area, South Asia, is an important part of our security and 
their security. We must recognize that the people of Pakistan love 
democracy. And, yes, what we have seen over the last couple of days 
really has given us pause.

Well, I want you to know that the Pakistan military under their 
Secretary of the army is doing something they don't usually do. Their 
structure has been that they have been monitoring or, if you will, 
watching the border. That has been their task. For the first time, they 
have accepted the responsibility of internally ridding their country of 
the terrorists, the ones who have taken over the Swat, who have 
undermined them, people whose faith may have drawn them to a particular 
situation where they thought the government wasn't functioning, so they 
allowed the Taliban and insurgents to take over.

And this is what we have, frankly, the devastation of 2.5 million 
people who are now moving from one place to the next. But the army is 
fighting the terrorists. And do you know what is more important? The 
people are standing up against the terrorists.

The legislation we have today will provide an investment through a 
prosperity fund. It will have certain criteria for Federal funding, for 
taxpayers' dollars to go to Pakistan. They must ensure that their 
nuclear materials are protected. They must make sure that they are 
fighting radicalism. And we can stop this kind of human devastation.

We know the international help that came to us during Hurricane 
Katrina. We know what we did with the tsunami. This is a terrorist 
tsunami. And I want to say that the Government, whether we agree or 
disagree with its strength, I believe they love democracy. These 
conditionalities that may be opposed will work their way through 
Congress. But if we didn't act today, we would continue to have the 
burials of so many people that are going on in this country, the kind 
of massive bombing that the terrorists think they can do to intimidate 
the people of Pakistan.

So, as a co-Chair of the Pakistan Caucus, I am grateful that we made 
a first step. I want the American people to know that your neighbors 
are Pakistani Americans. They are doctors, they are entrepreneurs, they 
are retailers. They love this country, and they want to help their 
country as well. I am glad we made this first step.

Let me move quickly to a domestic issue and put an explanation point 
on what we did right for Pakistan and say that I stand here today and 
support a restoration and bailout for automobile dealers. We missed the 
boat. We have dealerships who have gotten these ugly letters saying 
that even though you are a pillar of the community, you are in good 
financial shape, you can sell the cars, you must close.

Mr. Speaker, I stand against it, and I believe that as we move 
forward, we must have a carve-out for our automobile dealers who in 
fact can maintain their independence, who can sell cars. Whether or not 
it is by Fiat or whether or not it is someone else, Chrysler and GM 
cannot close by caveat, despite the bankruptcy structuring, the 
reordering, the reorganization under chapter 11. They cannot come and 
close hardworking automobile dealerships, and we as Americans and 
Members of Congress cannot forget them.

I will be looking forward to supporting legislation and writing 
legislation for automobile dealers carve-out and bailout.
