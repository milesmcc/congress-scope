`Mrs. BOXER â€” 1 May 2007`

---


Mrs. BOXER. This report is called ''Civilians Without Protection.'' I 
will go into it in a minute. But in light of everything that is 
happening, how on Earth could the President sit in the Oval Office and 
say: ''I am vetoing this bill that is coming to me, and I want to just 
continue what I am doing''? A military solution is what he is doing, 
and he is going to continue it.

In light of everything that has gone on, doesn't this President 
understand it is time for a change? Doesn't he listen to the voters? 
Doesn't he read these articles? ''Send me the bill. I am going to veto 
it''--very macho like. I do not think it is macho like. I think it is 
wrong. I do not think it is brave to continue a policy that is failing. 
I do not think it is courageous not to admit it is time for a change. I 
do not think it shows strength. I think it is stubborn. I think it is 
wrong. And, worst of all, our troops are paying the price for this 
stubbornness. This is not the same as being stubborn in an argument we 
might have about some small matter. Oh, I think this book is better 
than this book, and I think this singer is better than this one. This 
is involving the lives of our soldiers.

Now, this ''Civilians Without Protection'' report is very tough to 
read, by the International Red Cross. Let me share some of it with you: 
the pictures, the headlines, the words.

One section is called ''A conflict that spares no one.''




 In some regions, particularly Baghdad and area, families 


 are often too afraid to leave their homes to go to work or to 


 shop and too afraid to send their children to school because 


 of random violence and the threat of kidnapping for ransom.


This one is very tough to take--very tough to take. It is written by 
a young humanitarian worker from Baghdad. It is in the Red Cross 
report.




 Once I was called to an explosion site. There I saw a four-


 year-old boy sitting beside his mother's body, which had been 


 decapitated by the explosion. He was talking to her, asking 


 her what had happened. He had been taken out shopping by his 


 mom.


How do you sit back and say ''status quo''? How? How? Why not welcome 
a change? Why not welcome the Iraq Study Group? Why not welcome the 
work that has been done here in 50, 60 different hearings which we have 
held?

Another part: ''Sliding to disaster,'' in the International Red Cross 
report. Another part: ''Medical care under threat.'' Another part: 
''Dirty and scarce--the water crisis.'' Another part: ''Torn apart--The 
fate of separated families.'' It goes into the agony. I ask us all to 
imagine what it would


be like to worry about our kids for even 15 minutes, let alone days and 
months.

This Red Cross report is printed in the Record.

Mr. President, also, I ask unanimous consent that the entire article 
I referred to from the newspaper be printed in the Record.
