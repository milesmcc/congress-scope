`Mrs. FEINSTEIN â€” 7 June 2007`

---


Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Lugar, 
Senator Dodd, and Senator Hagel to introduce a resolution calling for a 
lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.

Our resolution reaffirms the Senate's commitment to a true and 
lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the 
establishment of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side 
in peace and security, and with recognized borders; denounces the use 
of violence and terror and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to 
Israel's security; calls on President Bush to pursue a robust 
diplomatic effort to engage the Israelis and Palestinians, reinvigorate 
negotiations, and make a two-state settlement a top priority; urges 
President Bush to consider appointing a high-level Special Envoy for 
Middle East Peace; calls on the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority to 
recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce and end all terror and 
incitement, and accept past agreements and obligations with Israel; 
calls on moderate Arab states in the region to intensify their 
diplomatic efforts toward a two-state solution and welcomes the Arab 
League Peace Initiative, and; calls on Israeli and Palestinian leaders 
to embrace efforts to achieve peace and refrain from taking any actions 
that would prejudice the outcome of final status negotiations.

Senator Baucus, Senator Byrd, Senator Whitehouse and Senator Sununu 
have also joined us as original cosponsors.

We are this week marking the the 40th anniversary of the start of the 
Six-Day War between Israel and a coalition of Arab states which lasted 
from June 5 to June 10, 1967. Israel's stunning triumph in that 
conflict, when its very existence was at stake, sent a powerful and 
unambiguous message to its neighbors and the international community 
that the existence of a Jewish homeland in the Middle East was a fact 
that could not be denied.

Since then, Israel, with the support and active engagement of the 
United States, has signed peace agreements with two of its adversaries 
from that war, first with Egypt in 1979 and then with Jordan in 1994.

Both treaties greatly enhanced Israel's security and brought hope to 
its people.

Yet a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement has remained 
elusive, resulting in the loss of numerous innocent lives and 
destroying the hopes and dreams of Israelis and Palestinians alike.

Since September 2000 and the start of the second Intifada, violence 
and terror have engulfed the region and devastated the prospects for 
peace.

It has become quite clear to me that the current impasse is not 
sustainable. There is no military solution to this conflict. The lack 
of any movement in the peace process only emboldens the opponents of 
peace, strengthens the hands of the extremists, and puts the vital 
interests of Israel, the Palestinian people, and the United States at 
risk.

Yet the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians have made it clear 
that they want to end this conflict and live side by side in peaceful 
coexistence, mutual dignity, and security.

We owe it to them and ourselves to do everything in our power to make 
this vision a reality.

Indeed, a just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and a 
comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement should be our top priorities 
in the region.

They will open the door to new opportunities, enabling us to tackle 
other seemingly intractable challenges in the region: the civil war in 
Iraq, the influence of Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iran's 
uranium enrichment program.

As the Iraq Study Group report argued, ''The United States will not 
be able to achieve its goals in the Middle East unless the United 
States deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict.''

We cannot achieve these goals by sitting on the sidelines or sending 
low-level envoys to the region.

We need a vigorous and sustained high level American presence on the 
ground in the Middle East to make this happen.

I know that Secretary of State Rice is personally committed to 
bringing both sides together so they will take on the tough issues and 
find the right solutions, and she has my full support.

She has already made four trips to the region and I hope she will 
return again soon.

President Bush should also become engaged in this process and 
consider appointing a Special Envoy for Middle East peace who has 
extensive experience dealing with this issue and has served in a high-
level government capacity.

We all know what a final peace agreement will look like. The drafters 
of the Geneva accord showed us that with courage and determination, the 
tough decisions can be made that will bring peace and prosperity to 
both sides.

While it is critical that the United States take a leadership role on 
this issue, it is also critical that moderate voices in the Arab world 
be a voice for peace.

That is why the Arab League Peace Initiative is important. It is an 
example where Arab leaders have stepped forward Hamas must also step 
forward and fulfill the demands of the international community by 
recognizing Israel's right to exist, renouncing and end all terror and 
incitement, and accepting past agreements between Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority.

Now is as good a time as ever to work for peace. There will always be 
excuses for those who don't want peace. But it is incumbent on those 
who wish for peace to work through the difficult issues.

As a United States Senator, I have stood by Israel and the Israeli 
people and will continue to do so. We will not waiver in our efforts to 
ensure their safety, stability, and prosperity. Achieving a just and 
lasting peace in the Middle East is the cornerstone of that endeavor.

I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
