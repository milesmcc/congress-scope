# BIPARTISAN CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `83f1bbffe6b90e78cc8cbade8b1aca32`
`Mr. REID â€” 1 February 2007`

Mr. REID. Madam President, this next vote is not necessary. As a 
result of yesterday's breakthrough in negotiations, the base bill for 
the Iraq debate will be the Warner-Levin legislation and not S. Con. 
Res. 2. So I will vote against cloture and urge both sides of the aisle 
to do likewise.

The most important question that I have been asked, by popular 
demand, is when are we going to have a vote on Monday. I have conferred 
with the Republican leader on more than one occasion. We can still vote 
at 4:30 and complete the 30 hours prior to Wednesday, which would be 
our goal. So we are going to vote at 4:30 on Monday on cloture on the 
Levin-Warner measure, unless we work something out beforehand. Again, 
that is 4:30 Monday.
