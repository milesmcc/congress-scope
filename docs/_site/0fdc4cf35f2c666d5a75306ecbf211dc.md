# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. There are many 
flaws in this resolution. One of the most serious is that while it 
gives lip-service to a desire to support and protect the troops, it 
turns around and disapproves of the plan that is best calculated by the 
commanders on the ground to bring order to Baghdad.

This surge is the best way, in the opinion of the commanders, to 
clamp down on the insurgency, to protect our troops and ultimately to 
lead to victory. I don't see how you can claim to protect and support 
the troops while taking away the best option for victory.

That brings up another serious flaw in this resolution: It has no 
positive alternative. The resolution seems to say that we should go on 
as before, which I thought my colleagues across the aisle said was 
unacceptable.

Yet another serious flaw is that Members of Congress, who are many 
thousands of miles away from the battlefield, are substituting their 
judgment for that of the commanders in the field. This is foolish and 
arrogant. This gives rise to a constitutional conflict as well. The 
Constitution gives the President the power of Commander in Chief. 
President Bush, who was reelected by a vote of the entire American 
people just 2 years ago, has the duty and authority to conduct the war 
in Iraq.

Congress has the power to declare war and to fund or to not fund war, 
but does not have the power to conduct a war. This constitutional 
division of powers is vital, because, among other things, a clear chain 
of command is better calculated to lead to victory with the least 
possible loss of life. War by committee, on the other hand, does not 
best serve the interests of our country or our troops.

Because this resolution is so deeply flawed, it will send bad 
messages if it is passed. It will send a message to our enemies that we 
are weak and unable to complete a difficult task. It will send a 
message to our allies that we are undependable. It will send a message 
to the families and loved ones of our fallen soldiers and marines, to 
our brave men and women who have been disabled and to the troops in the 
field, that their sacrifice is in vain because their mission is not 
worth our commitment. These messages will be destructive, and I urge my 
colleagues not to go down this road.

If America does abandon Iraq, which many of my colleagues across the 
aisle want to be the ultimate outcome, destruction will spread across 
the entire Middle East and will be more likely to come to our own 
shores.

I know that the struggle against terrorism is difficult, but we 
cannot give up. Yes, we must learn as we go, and, yes, we must adapt to 
changing circumstances. But we must not think that retreat will bring 
relief. We and the entire world will pay a terrible price if we go down 
that road. This resolution is the first step down that road. I urge the 
defeat of this resolution.
