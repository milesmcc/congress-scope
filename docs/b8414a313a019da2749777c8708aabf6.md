Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator 
Brown, introduce legislation that would enhance VA's pain management 
program. It is estimated that nearly 30 percent of Americans, that is 
some 86 million people, suffer from chronic or acute pain every year. A 
recent study conducted by VA researchers in Connecticut found that 
nearly 50 percent


of veteran patients that are seen at VA facilities reported that they 
experience pain regularly.

While pain increases in severity with age, it is also a growing 
problem among younger veterans who have been injured in the wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of these veterans are coming home with 
severe injuries, often traumatic brain injuries, that require intensive 
rehabilitation. In some cases, these younger veterans will have to live 
with the long-term effects of their injuries, of which pain is a large 
and debilitating part.

Pain management is an area of health care that by many accounts is 
not yet up to par, in both the private and public sectors. The bill we 
are introducing would enhance VA's pain management program on a 
national, system-wide level, by requiring VA to establish a pain care 
initiative at every VA health care facility. Every hospital and clinic 
would be required to employ a professionally recognized pain assessment 
tool or process, and ensure that every patient who is determined to be 
in chronic or acute pain is treated appropriately.

The profile of a veteran in pain is often times different than that 
of his or her counterpart in the private sector. For example, veterans 
suffering from chronic pain are more likely to be receiving treatment 
for other problems including depression, substance abuse, alcoholism, 
or post traumatic stress disorder. Understanding and treating their 
pain must be a priority, and this bill will help VA enhance the 
department's existing pain management program.

VA's current pain management efforts are worthwhile, but are 
unfortunately not adequate to meet the all of the needs of veterans. 
Pain management in VA continues to be relatively decentralized and 
unstandardized. Some VA medical centers have adopted successful 
approaches and procedures to deal with pain, while others have been 
less active. Fortunately, VA has begun the work of identifying 
professional talent and developing ideas that provide the groundwork of 
an effective pain management program. This bill would build upon that 
foundation and help ensure that these ideas become practice.

This bill provides us with an opportunity to help the thousands of 
veterans who are living in pain each and every day. I urge all of my 
colleagues to support this legislation.

I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
