Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States is 
going to urge a troop escalation in Iraq. I must protest this for the 
following reasons:

This war was wrong from the beginning. Our focus should have been 
Afghanistan. We had a real opportunity to bring freedom and change to 
Afghanistan. Instead, we diverted our attention to Iraq with disastrous 
results.

More troops will not bring the United States more support from the 
Iraqis, but it will bring our troops and the people of Iraq more 
misery, more fighting, more injuries and more death.

We are spending our children's future in this war.

There are no benefits to either the United States, to Iraq or to the 
world.
