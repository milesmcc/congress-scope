Mr. LYNCH. Firstly, I would like to thank Representative Brown for 
graciously yielding me time for speaking on this important resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 
336 a resolution which honors the sacrifice and contributions made by 
America's disabled veterans. The brave men and women currently serving 
in our Armed Forces, and the veterans who have put on the uniform 
before them, deserve our utmost appreciation for their continued 
commitment to the protection of this Nation.

Regrettably, millions of these veterans have been wounded and 
disabled while defending the rights and freedoms that uniquely define 
our country. According to the latest statistics provided by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, there are approximately 2.9 million 
disabled veterans now receiving services from the VA. Of the 2.9 
million disabled veterans, a total of 30,000 have served in either 
Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

The great sacrifice that these men and women have made on behalf of 
the American people cannot go unnoticed. American veterans have earned 
our undying gratitude and our continued support. During last year's 
appropriation process, we began to head in the right direction, in my 
opinion, when Congress allocated $87.59 billion to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, an $8 billion increase from the previous year.



Of this total, $37.2 billion was provided the Veterans Health 
Administration, with $3.6 billion allocated to post-traumatic stress 
disorder funding, and $189.25 million for traumatic brain injury 
funding, and $500 million for medical and prosthetic research. Our 
commitment to America's disabled veterans is exemplified by honoring 
these men and women in the present and continuing to invest in their 
future.

I thank Mr. Altmire for introducing this thoughtful resolution and 
urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 
336.
