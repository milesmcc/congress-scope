`Mr. BRADY of Texas â€” 15 April 2010`

Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, I support American workers and families, and that is why 
I must oppose the legislation before us that would heap another $18 
billion onto the dangerous deficits this Congress has already amassed 
and that American workers will ultimately be made to pay for in the 
coming years. On this Tax Day, as an overburdened Nation staggering 
under dangerous deficits, we need to send this bill back to the drawing 
board and return with legislation that is paid for that will not create 
more debt, that will help create more jobs instead of economic 
uncertainty and, ultimately, more job losses.

The legislation before us would extend for another 2 months special 
Federal spending programs that today allow unemployed workers to 
collect up to 99 weeks of benefits in most States. That is nearly 2 
years of unemployment checks today which are by far an all-time U.S. 
record. That compares with a total of up to 26 weeks of benefits 
payable in almost all States during normal times.

We all want to help unemployed workers who are frustrated by a White 
House who has taken their eye off the economic ball. They're frustrated 
by this Congress that has sought an extreme agenda rather than focusing 
on jobs. But it is impossible to ignore the fact that those extra 73 
weeks of Federal benefits paid today, a full 17 months courtesy of 
Federal taxpayers, come at an enormous price.

In all, this bill would add $18 billion--that is more than the size 
of the entire NASA budget--add that to this year's trillion dollar 
deficit, including $13 billion more for the unemployment benefits it 
would extend. That is on top of the approximately $100 billion spent so 
far on these programs; and, if extended for the remainder of this year 
as we expect, another $50 billion more would be added to the national 
debt.

None of this has or will be paid for. In fact, the Federal 
unemployment account has long since been bankrupted; yet we continue to 
spend, and now are being bailed out with general revenues. And who will 
bail out general revenues when they run out? Taxpayers, through more 
taxes and more general revenues the government extracts from them.

So far in the past year and 2 months since the President has been in 
office, taxpayers are paying $2,100 more per individual because of $670 
billion in new tax increases. And if President Obama's budget is 
approved by the Democratic Congress, we will heap almost $3 trillion 
more on American taxpayers. And what's sad, again, is that we continue 
to heap debt without any opportunity, without any promise that is kept 
to pay for them.

When our Democrat friends took office, they promised they would pay 
for the wars, pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but not a dime 
yet. They


promised they would balance the budget. Today we see trillion dollar 
deficits as far as the eye can see. They enacted PAYGO and said we're 
going to pay for all new spending, but as this bill today shows, 
they've done nothing of that and, in fact, have invented extravagant 
loopholes, declared anything an emergency simply as an excuse to 
continue spending. And, of course, they promised to curb earmarks. In 
fact, eliminating earmarks could nearly pay for this bill, but they've 
not kept that promise either.

Mr. Speaker, we can do better than this. What unemployed workers 
really want are jobs and paychecks, not almost 2 years of unemployment 
checks and more massive debt for our country. Unfortunately, jobs are 
something Democrats in this Congress have been totally incapable of 
delivering.

Instead of creating 3.7 million jobs as promised, their stimulus bill 
was followed by 3 million more job losses. Instead of holding 
unemployment under 8 percent as promised, it soared to nearly 10 
percent and remains close to that today.


Sixteen million Americans are unemployed, including record numbers 
for over a year. In fact, the White House promised, if you passed the 
stimulus, 90 percent of the new jobs we create would be in the private 
sector. The opposite is true. The private sector has lost 3.7 million 
jobs, but government jobs have been created--almost 300,000. So the 
people who are getting these unemployment benefits are the ones whose 
promises have not been kept by this White House and this Democrat 
Congress.

We need to start over and actually start paying for new spending, 
starting with this bill. The only way to do that is to defeat this bill 
and bring it back in a paid-for fashion.

But beyond that, Mr. Speaker, we also need to do the things that 
really help create jobs for workers. We can start by stopping 
frightening the job creators; businesses who are delaying important 
rehiring decisions, investment decisions, frightened by all of the new 
taxes proposed in Congress, the new health care mandates, the rising 
energy taxes, the talk of new regulations. We have to stop frightening 
consumers who know that, ultimately, they'll be relied on to pay this 
terrible debt.

We need to reward innovation and small business job creation through 
lower taxes and support for innovation, and we need to pursue free 
trade agreements that find new customers for American workers and 
American companies. That is why, Mr. Speaker, we must send this bill 
back and make it paid for, and stop punishing American workers and 
families.

I reserve the balance of my time.
