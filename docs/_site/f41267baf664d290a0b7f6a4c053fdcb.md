Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

I rise today in support of the bill to amend S. 1716, which 
previously passed the other body and is now before the House.

In May, Congress passed and the President signed U.S. Troop 
Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability 
Appropriations Act, 2007. This law included disaster assistance for 
crop and livestock producers for losses sustained between January 1, 
2005 and February 28, 2007.

Producers were able to receive payments for losses sustained in only 
one of these years and were required to be in a county that was 
declared a disaster county in that same calendar year. This law also 
contained provisions found in section 9012 requiring that forage 
producers must have participated in a crop insurance pilot program or 
the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance program during the crop year 
for which compensation is received.

As a result of section 9012, very few livestock producers are 
eligible for the disaster relief passed by Congress because crop 
insurance is more widely used in crop production than in livestock 
production. The amendment before the House will strike section 9012 to 
broaden the eligibility requirements to allow more livestock producers 
that suffered loss to participate than were allowed under the 
previously passed disaster package. The amendment before the House will 
not change direct spending because this amendment reconfirms the 
assumptions made when the Congressional Budget Office scored the 
original bill.

I believe section 9012 establishes an appropriate incentive for 
producers to manage their risk using the available tools. However, it 
is not reasonable to put this policy in place without warning. To tell 
producers in 2007 that they should have bought crop insurance in 2005 
to get assistance for losses incurred in 2005 is not fair. Livestock 
producers should know, however, that in the future, crop insurance or 
participation in similar risk-management programs will likely be 
required to qualify for future disaster assistance.

I commend the gentlewoman from South Dakota and others who have


worked for this legislation. I support the bill to amend S. 1716 and 
urge its adoption.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
