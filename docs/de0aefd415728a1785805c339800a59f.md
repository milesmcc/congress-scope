Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to commend the senior Senator from 
Washington State for her statement. She expressed similar concerns at 
the time of the original vote on the war in Iraq. She courageously 
stood up and spoke to why the mistakes were being made.

I have to say, especially seeing the distinguished Presiding Officer 
from my own State of Vermont, I think it is safe to say, if the same 
speech had been given in the State of Vermont, way over across the 
continent to our State, it would have been widely and happily received.

We have a situation where one time people put on the ribbons to 
support the troops, as we all do, we all do, but then when the budget 
comes, we find, well, we will support everything but those things 
needed by our troops when they come home--everything that is needed by 
our veterans, everything that is needed by a lot of our troops while 
they are over there, and this will not change until more people speak 
out as courageously as the Senator from Washington State has.

I commend her. She has been very consistent. They are words that this 
Vermonter is glad to hear. I am glad she is saying it at a time when 
both the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from Vermont, and 
I had a chance to be here. I applaud her for it.
