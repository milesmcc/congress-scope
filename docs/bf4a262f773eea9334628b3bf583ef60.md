Mr. MATHESON. Well, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for conducting 
this Special Order tonight. That list, that article that you just were 
referring to is not a one-time deal. I think we all have a sense after 
over 4 years of the Iraqi operation having taken place, I think we have 
all heard stories, and those news articles seem to come out more and 
more often where money has been spent and we haven't gotten result in 
terms of rebuilding the infrastructure. That is a cause of concern and 
that is one of the motivations behind the Blue Dogs coming together 
with legislation in this Congress called the Operation Iraqi Freedom 
Cost Accountability Act.

The Blue Dogs have come up with this bill which has been given the 
number H. Res. 97, and I want to take a brief moment to walk through 
what this legislation does.

Now, quite frankly, before we go through the specifics, I should say 
it puts forth tangible and commonsense proposals to ensure future 
transparency and the accountability in the funding of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. This is a first step. There is more we probably need to do, 
but this is an important first step to make sure that resources are 
getting to our troops in the field in a reasonable manner.

There are four crucial points in this legislation demanding for 
fiscal accountability in Iraq.

First, it calls for transparency on how Iraq war funds are spent.

Second, it calls for the creation of a Truman Commission to 
investigate the awarding of contracts.

And, third, it calls for the need to fund the Iraqi war through the 
normal appropriations process and not through emergency supplemental 
appropriations processes.

Fourth, it calls for using American resources to improve the Iraqi 
assumption of internal policing operations.

Now, the resolution also calls for the Iraqi Government and its 
people to progress towards full responsibility for internal policing of 
the country because ultimately that is where we need to go.

Now recently, and I know other speakers have mentioned this, a 
significant accomplishment took place in terms of the Blue Dogs working 
with the Armed Services Committee to include key provisions of the Blue 
Dog accountability legislation in the Department of Defense 
authorization bill that we are going to be voting on here in the House 
of Representatives later on this week.



In doing so, I think it's an important first step toward ensuring 
greater fiscal transparency in the funding of the war in Iraq.

The American people deserve to know that their tax dollars are being 
spent wisely and that our troops have the resources they need to 
succeed. The Blue Dogs are committed to passing legislation that 
accomplishes that goal.

Now, members of the Blue Dog Coalition also believe strongly that 
funding requests should come through the normal appropriations process, 
as I said, rather than through these multiple emergency supplemental 
requests. Let's make it part of our overall budget so we can plan 
accordingly.

I think that again with the Defense authorization bill coming up this 
week and with key components of the Blue Dog legislation included in 
that bill, I think that's a significant step forward for this country. 
I am proud that the Blue Dogs were able to play an important role in 
moving this legislation forward.
