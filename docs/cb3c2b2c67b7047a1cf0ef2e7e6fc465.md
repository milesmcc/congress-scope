Mr. BIDEN. I would assert I am confident there are some major players 
in this administration who agree with the tact I am taking, and I would 
invite--that is not why he is on the floor, I know--I would invite any 
advice or suggestions--not at this moment--from my friend from Indiana 
or my friend from Virginia as to how to deal with this.

But, ladies and gentlemen, it took us--it took us--13 years to get to 
our Philadelphia moment. It is going to take the Iraqis a lot longer. I 
do not want to see a regional war in the meantime because every one of 
us knows, whether we are here 3 years from now, there will not be 
133,000 troops in Iraq. That will not be the case no matter who is 
President. The American people will not stand for it, and we will 
respond.

I yield the floor.
