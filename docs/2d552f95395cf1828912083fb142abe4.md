Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just this morning, the world learned of the 
death of Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho, who was kidnapped 2 weeks ago 
following the Way of the Cross ceremony at a church in Mosul. I extend 
my condolences to the Chaldean community in Iraq and in the United 
States on the tragic death of one of their church's spiritual leaders. 
The Chaldean community and those impacted by this tragic death are in 
the thoughts and prayers of people around the world from all religions.

The death of this spiritual leader demonstrates the fragility of the 
situation in Iraq and the vulnerability of the Chaldean community. I 
hope the Archbishop's life of integrity and testimony to his faith in 
God and in his country will serve as an inspiration to the Chaldean 
community as they move forward in these difficult times.

I also hope this tragic death will motivate President Bush to focus 
more attention on assisting this highly vulnerable community in 
northern Iraq, particularly as al-qaida shifts much of its operations 
to the north in search of new victims.
