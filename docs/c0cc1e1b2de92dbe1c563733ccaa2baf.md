Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
express my disappointment over the continued lack of progress in Iraq. 
The sobering content in both the GAO report and the Jones report should 
finally be a wake-up call that some Members in this House need in order 
to act to bring our troops home.

The findings should make it clear to this tone-deaf Administration 
that our current path in Iraq is failing. The problem of sectarian 
violence in Iraq will not be solved by sacrificing more blood of young 
Americans.

After losing more than 3,500 of our brave men and women and spending 
close to half a trillion dollars, it is time to bring our troops home. 
To continue to ask our service men and women to make the ultimate 
sacrifice for a misguided policy is simply immoral.
