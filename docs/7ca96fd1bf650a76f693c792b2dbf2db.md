`Mr. WAMP â€” 19 June 2008`

Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman.

I just want to say as I begin that the gentlelady from Texas said 
that this money goes to the White House. Thankfully, this money goes to 
the men and women in the uniform of our Armed Forces who volunteered to 
stand between a threat and our civilian population.

And I want to commend everyone in the House for bringing us to this 
moment, because the traditions of this great country and this Congress 
are to meet at the water's edge at a time of war. And we have learned 
the lessons of history. And we know that it's important to fund the men 
and women who are in harm's way with the resources they need.

The particular piece that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards) and 
I have worked together on are the issues of quality of life. And let me 
tell you that this supplemental appropriations bill meets those quality 
of life needs on military housing, the child development centers for 
the families that are so critical, the medical treatment at places like 
Walter Reed that we have read and heard so much about and polytrauma 
rehabilitation centers.

We know that asymmetrical warfare has caused critical problems that 
must be addressed. People ask me and Mr. Edwards often, are we doing 
what's right for our men and women in uniform? This bill helps us to do 
that in a significant way and meet the needs of our veteran population. 
It meets the needs of barracks that we know and have heard about. And 
it fully funds what we need to on the Base Realignment and Closure 
Commission so they can meet their schedule which we were not meeting. 
This is so important.

And then this issue of GI benefits for education. Of course the men 
and women in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve this benefit. For weeks we've 
all been writing about how this is so appropriate. And today we come 
together. So I applaud everyone, most of all those volunteers in our 
military, who have agreed to answer our country's call and stand in 
harm's way. My nephew, who just got back from Iraq, and my other nephew 
who is a marine on his way to Afghanistan, and all of the other brave 
Americans, we're answering their call today. They answered our call.

We meet together to do what is right for our country thanks to the 
leadership in the majority and the minority for finally coming together 
and doing what is right. This is a good bill. Let's move it forward. 
And let's honor our commitment to our men and women in uniform.
