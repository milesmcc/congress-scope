Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of 
Army Specialist Jeremy Costello. Spc. Costello was a motor transport 
operator who was recently killed by an improvised explosive device 
while fighting for freedom in Iraq.

Costello was a 22 year-old from Carlinville, Illinois who was 
assigned to 5th Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment, 4th Brigade, 
1st Cavalry Division out of Fort Bliss, TX.

Costello is survived by his 4-year old daughter of Alton. I am proud 
of the service this young man gave to our country and the service his 
fellow troops perform everyday. Not enough can be said about Spc. 
Costello. Some of his awards and decorations speak to what a great 
soldier and man he was; the Combat Action Badge and Driver and Mechanic 
Badge. It is troops like Costello that are risking their lives day in 
and day out to ensure our freedom here at home and to others throughout 
the rest of the world. My best wishes go out to his family and all the 
troops fighting to ensure freedom and democracy. May God bless him and 
may God continue to bless America.
