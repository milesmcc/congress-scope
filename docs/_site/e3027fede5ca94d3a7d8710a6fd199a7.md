Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield myself 10 seconds to read the 
amendment:




 Not later than December 31, 2010, the President shall 


 submit to Congress a report, together with a timetable for 


 the completion of that redeployment.


Completion of that redeployment, obviously, from Afghanistan. That is 
a ''shall;'' it is a report; it is a completion of the redeployment.

I yield the floor.
