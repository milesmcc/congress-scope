`Mr. NYE â€” 15 January 2009`

Mr. NYE. Mr. Speaker, for most of the past 12 years, I have traveled 
all over the world with the Foreign Service. In places like Kosovo, 
Afghanistan and Iraq, I had the honor to serve alongside the brave men 
and women of our Armed Forces.

It is now my honor to be here as the Representative of Virginia's 
Second Congressional District--to represent the people of Hampton Roads 
and the Eastern Shore--and to represent our military personnel and 
their families.

We have very important work ahead of us--strengthening the economy, 
restoring fiscal responsibility and standing up for the families who 
are working


every day to make a better life for the next generation.

While we're doing that, we must always remember that we still have 
people over there--we're fighting two wars--and as we face new threats, 
we must maintain a strong military, and we must fully support our 
troops in harm's way.

Mr. Speaker, our military personnel and their families ask nothing 
more, and they deserve nothing less than the same level of care and 
devotion that they have shown our country. This is not a partisan 
issue. It is a basic American value, and it is a value I will champion 
every day as a Member of Congress.
