Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, in the last 3/1/2/ minutes I have, I wish 
to point out what has happened in this matter.

Chairman Leahy advised me this nomination would go through the 
Judiciary Committee on a voice vote. Then, when that effort was made, 
Senator Feingold objected and any member of the Judiciary Committee has 
the right to hold over a nominee for 1 week. So, it did not go through 
on a voice vote, notwithstanding the fact that Senator Leahy, the 
chairman, said that was his plan.

Senator McConnell has advised that the majority leader, Senator Reid, 
had said the nomination would be confirmed before the Memorial Day 
recess, which is some time ago now. So, this nomination was on the 
brink of confirmation, according to the chairman's statement that it 
would go through committee on a voice vote. He didn't expect someone to 
raise an objection, and he was powerless to move it on a voice vote 
once an objection was raised, but that was his expectation and mine.

And, as I said, the majority leader told the Republican leader there 
would be a confirmation before the Memorial Day recess.

It is my hope we will not allow partisanship to once again grip this 
body. This Senate, under Republican control, wouldn't give hearings to 
President Clinton's nominees and wouldn't bring them up for floor 
votes. I objected to that, bucking my party, crossing party lines, and 
voting for Clinton nominees.

We had protracted filibusters in 2004 and threats of the 
Constitutional--or ''nuclear''--option. I hope we do not go back to 
that. This body, as we all know, works on unanimous consent. Any 
Senator can raise an objection to dispensing with a reading of an 
amendment or a reading of the record, as we saw during the immigration 
debate, and can tie up this Senate endlessly if someone wants to impede 
the work of the Senate. It is my hope we will not descend to that.

We have very important matters to take up--Iraq, the Department of 
Defense reauthorization bill, the override of the President's veto on 
stem cells, and many appropriations bills. This man, Judge Southwick--I 
have gone through his record in detail. My own record on the Judiciary 
Committee is one of nonpartisanship. If I have found nominees submitted 
by Republican Presidents to be objectionable, I have not hesitated to 
say so. But this man has an impeccable record, an outstanding record, 
with 985 authored opinions. The two opinions that have been called into 
question are opinions which he didn't write, but merely joined, on 
matters which--while they might have been articulated differently, 
might have been more sensitive--certainly are not disqualifiers. This 
man ought to be confirmed. I have taken the time to go into some detail 
on his record because I have told my colleagues about his record and 
many people have been surprised there is controversy.

I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania for sitting 
overtime and my colleague from Minnesota for her patience--I think she 
has been patient--and yield the floor.
