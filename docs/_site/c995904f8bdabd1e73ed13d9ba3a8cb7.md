Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, a few minutes ago my friend from Georgia 
described buying something he didn't need at a price he couldn't 
afford. I want to thank him for giving us a perfect description of the 
last 7 years of the governance of this country under the Bush 
administration.

We got a lot of things we didn't need: a war in Iraq, a misadventure 
in Iraq at a price we couldn't afford, $4 trillion in new debt under 
their watch. We got $12 billion a month in Iraq under their watch.

This is something we do need and we can afford. Higher college 
scholarships for American students, lower school loan interest rates 
for American students. And it is paid for, unlike their massive 
spending increase, unlike their tax break giveaways to the wealthy, 
this does not increase the deficit by a dollar. We are changing their 
failed policy of buying things we don't need at prices we can't afford. 
They should vote for that change today.
