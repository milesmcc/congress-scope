Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Janel's 
Industries, Inc. of Cassopolis, Michigan, as the recipient of the 
Defense Logistics Agency's, DLA, Business Alliance Award for 
Outstanding Readiness Support in the Service Disabled, Veteran-Owned 
Small Business Category.

Janel's Industries, Inc. specializes in cable assemblies and wiring 
harnesses, which have been used to support the mission of our brave 
soldiers here in the United States as well as those actively serving in 
Iraq. Janel's Industries, Inc., has supported the DLA mission as well 
as our national interests by satisfying the military's increased demand 
for supplies in an expedited manner. In addition, these products were 
shipped to the military ahead of schedule, at no additional cost to the 
U.S. Government or the American taxpayer.

Once again, I would like to personally recognize Janel's Industries, 
Inc. and its employees for going above and beyond to provide such an 
invaluable service to our military. The United States is truly a better 
place because of their contributions.
