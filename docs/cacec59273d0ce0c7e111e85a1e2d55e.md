Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and service of Captain Adam Snyder of Fort Pierce, Florida, who passed 
away on December 5, 2007, from battle injuries suffered in Iraq.

Adam was 26 years old.

Captain Snyder belonged to the 101st Airborne Division, stationed at 
Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He was the fourth generation Snyder to proudly 
serve the United States military. Adam was serving his second tour in 
Iraq.

Adam was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, where one of his 
professors, John McVan, described Adam as ''one of the best and 
brightest I've ever had.''

Adam's brilliance was not limited to his military career. He 
impressed whomever he encountered in all walks of life. Adam looked 
forward to returning home and pursuing his dream of acting. His 
modesty, bravery, and humanity are qualities rarely found in such great 
measure in one man.

Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart but great pride that I stand 
here today in this sacred hall to honor Adam and his family. I want to 
thank Adam's family for giving America a hero who went to work every 
day defending his country so that we can enjoy liberty.

Adam, our Nation for all eternity will be in your debt for the 
ultimate sacrifice you have made.
