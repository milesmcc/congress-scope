Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I would just like to encourage all of my 
colleagues to watch a very special edition of ''60 Minutes'' this week. 
It's going to be focusing on the Ironman Battalion, the 133rd, based 
out of my hometown of Waterloo, Iowa. It is the whole 60 Minutes 
program. They are currently stationed in Iraq.

A member of the Iowa Legislature, Representative Ray Zirkelbach, has 
been serving and has missed two sessions of the Iowa Legislature 
because of the extension of their deployment.

I am very, very proud of the Ironman Battalion. I am in frequent 
contact with their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Correll, 
who is also from my district, Strawberry Point. I think it's 
significant that as we head into this Memorial Day weekend, people like 
me, my father served in the Marine Corps on Iwo Jima, that affected his 
entire life, my brother works at a VA hospital in Knoxville, Iowa; it's 
important that we pause and reflect on these sacrifices that we talk 
about every day in this Chamber, but also that we honor the brave men 
and women serving this country.

I think this program is going to do an excellent job of exposing 
everyday, middle-class Americans who picked up out of their very busy 
lives to serve this country in its time of need, and I think it will be 
a very informative and rewarding experience for everyone.
