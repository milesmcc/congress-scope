`Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico â€” 15 November 2007`

Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rhode 
Island talked about the importance of upholding the Constitution, and 
there is something in the manager's amendment to this bill that was 
inserted without any hearing in the committee that I don't understand, 
that makes no sense to me. It is a provision that says, very plainly: 
This act and the amendments made by this act shall not be construed to 
prohibit surveillance of, or grant any rights to, an alien not 
permitted to be in or remain in the United States.

Now, I think there are probably a lot of people on this side of the 
aisle who don't have a problem with that provision. What I don't 
understand is why you all are proposing it.

Here is the irony here. This bill will extend rights under our 
Constitution to foreigners in foreign countries, while denying the 
protections of the Constitution to some 12 million people who are not 
legally in the United States, when the case law is clear that they do 
have rights. Whether we think they should have rights or not, the case 
law is absolutely clear. So we will deny those rights to people in the 
United States while extending them to people in foreign countries?

I think we should be clear with the American people why we insisted 
on fixing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and did so 
successfully in August. We had soldiers who were kidnapped in Iraq by 
insurgents.



And because of changes in technology and the demands of the court, 
the American military had to go to lawyers in the United States to get 
a warrant to try to intercept the communications of the terrorists 
trying to kill them. That took time, too much time. And the law had to 
be fixed.

Soldiers should not need an army of lawyers in Washington to listen 
to the communications of the enemy that's trying to kill them. This 
needed to be fixed, and we fixed it the first week of August.

We all remember where we were on the morning of 9/11. We remember who 
we were with, what we were wearing, what we ate for breakfast.



But people don't remember where they were the day that the British 
Government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking on to 
airliners and blowing them up simultaneously over the Atlantic. We 
don't remember it because it didn't happen. And the reason it didn't 
happen is because of exceptional intelligence and the cooperation of 
the British, Pakistani and American Governments.
