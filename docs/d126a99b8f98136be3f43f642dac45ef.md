Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

With respect to your latter question, sustaining our troops in the 
field, under the continuing resolution, we think that the authority to 
do that exists, and we've been advised that.

With respect to if we pass the Defense appropriations bill, it's our 
advice as we understand it from the Pentagon that they will have 
sufficient funds through the beginning of next year to fund their 
needs. Mr. Obey, I'm sure, will be discussing with us and others on the 
status of the supplemental.

I note that he's left now, but the chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee was on the floor. He has indicated he thinks that they will 
have sufficient funds if the Defense appropriations bill passes and is 
signed by the President. That passed, as you know, in an overwhelming 
vote here as well. We hope to see that bill get to the President. I 
don't know exactly what's going to happen to it in the Senate, we'll 
have to see that, but I hope that will pass.

With respect to the first question, there's no intention of bringing 
a surcharge to this floor. What Mr. Obey was saying is that this war 
was projected to cost $60 billion by the White House when it started. 
We're going to be at $1 trillion before too long. That bill is going to 
be paid by somebody. We talked about our children and grandchildren 
will be paying this bill. And what Mr. Obey's point was is that the 
people who are being asked to sacrifice are those going into Iraq, 
those families who send people to Iraq, and that the rest of us really 
aren't paying much of a price, but our grandchildren and children will 
pay that price. I think that was his point.

But in answer to the gentleman's question, we have no intention of 
bringing such a bill to the floor.
