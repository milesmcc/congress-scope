Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to add my voice to 
those deeply disappointed by conditions found at Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center. The physical infrastructure and administrative problems 
revealed are absolutely inexcusable. As a Nation and as a military, we 
have a responsibility to provide both top-quality acute care and top-
quality outpatient treatment.

The fine doctors and nurses in Iraq; at Landstuhl, Germany; and at 
Walter Reed provide excellent medical care that has saved countless 
lives. But it is clear that a lack of leadership and administrative 
initiative at the top created these shameful conditions.

The American military has historically entrusted the ultimate 
responsibility and accountability to those in command. I was pleased 
that the Army leadership followed that proud tradition, and I am 
hopeful that Walter


Reed's new commander, Major General Eric R. Schoomaker, will rebuild 
trust in the Army's medical service. I am also hopeful that a number of 
corrective actions announced last week by Army Chief of Staff Peter 
Schoomaker will help ensure each soldier receives the care which he or 
she deserves and that no one, no one, falls through the cracks.
