`Mr. BIDEN â€” 28 January 2008`

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on December 31, the United Nations and the 
African Union jointly assumed control of the peacekeeping mission in 
Darfur. But, sadly, little has changed for the people of Darfur.

The United Nations Security Council has authorized over 26,000 
peacekeepers, but just over 9,000 are on the ground in Darfur.

The government of Sudan had promised to abide by the United Nations 
resolution, but it continues to obstruct it at almost every turn.

Some of the rebel leaders have begun to join in coalitions with one 
another, an important step for the peace process, but others continue 
to prey on civilians and humanitarian aid workers and to threaten 
peacekeepers.

And the nations of the world had pledged to help end the genocide, 
but they are falling short where it counts.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon reports that no one has stepped up 
to provide the 24 helicopters that are needed to transport and protect 
the peacekeepers and to give them the mobility that they need to do 
their jobs.

That is inexcusable. We cannot allow genocide and suffering to 
continue because the combined nations of the world cannot find 24 
helicopters to help stop it.

That is why today, joined by Senator Lugar and a number of other 
colleagues, I have introduced a resolution expressing the Sense of the 
Senate that the world must not allow this peacekeeping mission to 
founder because we cannot find 24 suitable aircraft within our vast 
arsenals.

I recognize that helicopters are expensive vehicles that are in short 
supply, with wars raging in Afghanistan and Iraq and with peacekeeping 
missions in the Congo and now being deployed to Chad as well.

But a considerable number of nations possess aerial vehicles with the 
capabilities that are needed for this mission. Together, we could fill 
this gap.

The United Nations is seeking 18 utility and 6 tactical helicopters. 
According to a piece in the Washington Post, the member nations of NATO 
alone possess over 18,000 helicopters.

Not all of these 18,000 aircraft would be suitable for this mission. 
NATO reserves are taxed in Afghanistan and elsewhere, but the potential 
vehicles certainly exist. NATO is not alone in this capability. Other 
countries could also step up to fill this need.

Secretary General Ban has stated that these vehicles are 
indispensable. He reports that the United Nations-African Union mission 
must ''be capable of rapid mobility over large distances, especially 
over terrain where roads are the exception.'' Ban also said that 
''Without the missing helicopters, this mobility--a fundamental 
requirement for the implementation of the [Security Council's] 
mandate--will not be possible.''

Helicopters alone will not save Darfur. The needs there are immense 
and growing. The United Nations revealed last month that acute 
malnutrition in the region is rising and surpassing emergency levels in 
some areas. To make matters worse, the Government of Khartoum is 
continuing to obstruct deployment of U.N. peacekeepers. They have 
objected to non-African peacekeepers, such as a team of Norwegian 
engineers, and they are slowing deployment by denying visas and land 
permits and denying night flights. Most seriously of all, earlier this 
month, Sudanese troops opened fire on a clearly marked U.N. convoy, 
badly injuring a driver.

The world must not allow the Khartoum government to dictate terms to 
the UN mission. The European Union and United Nations Security Council 
should, I believe, join the United States in imposing strong economic 
sanctions on the Sudanese government.

We should also continue to pressure the rebel groups to cease all 
attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers and engage in a peace 
process to bring a real solution for the people of Darfur.

We should do all these things and more, but, first and foremost, we 
should ensure that the United Nations and African Union have the tools 
that they need to carry out their mission.

The United States has already provided more than $4.5 billion since 
2004 in response to the Darfur crisis. That is an enormous contribution 
and it should not fall on our shoulders to fill this particular gap in 
the peacekeeping mission.

That is why I have repeatedly written President Bush asking him to 
use the powers of persuasion of his office to personally contact other 
heads of state to ask them to commit the needed vehicles and crews. I 
have also written the Secretary General of NATO and President Hu of 
China, asking them to help fill this gap.

Our resolution urges the members of the international community with 
the necessary assets to contribute the needed vehicles and crews.

Preventing genocide is a global responsibility. Too often the world 
has failed to keep this commitment, and it has failed Darfur for too 
long.

We cannot allow the government of Khartoum to block deployment of the 
26,000 peacekeepers, but it would perhaps be even more unforgivable if 
the international community refuses to provide the peacekeepers with 
the equipment and vehicles that they need. Then we will have done 
Khartoum's job for them by obstructing ourselves.
