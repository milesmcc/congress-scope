`Mr. LEWIS of California â€” 2 May 2007`

Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

Mr. Speaker, the gentlelady who spoke just before me, our respected 
Speaker, is a person I have worked with for most of my life in public 
affairs. Our Speaker suggested that the President was wrong, and, Mr. 
Speaker, I humbly suggest that in this instance, our esteemed Speaker 
is wrong.

Madam Speaker, it was no secret that this conference report was going 
to be vetoed. Early on, the President made very clear his intention to 
veto this legislation because of the Iraq withdrawal language and the 
many unrelated and costly spending items that have absolutely nothing 
to do with the global war on terror and recovery efforts on the gulf 
coast.

It is no secret that many Members of the House and Senate, both 
Republicans and Democrats, had strong reservations about the manner in 
which this legislation undermined the authority of the President, our 
Commander in Chief.

From the beginning of this process, Members have expressed their 
concern about how this legislation placed military decisions in the 
hands of politicians rather than military commanders in the field. The 
last thing our country or our troops need is to have 535 Members and 
Senators micromanaging the war in Iraq. That simply is not our job, 
Madam Speaker.

Recent history reminds us that the enemy we face in Iraq, Afghanistan 
and in other countries that harbor terrorists will stop at nothing to 
attack the United States and our allies.

My colleagues, now is not the time for the United States to back down 
from its commitment to the war on terror. Now is not the time for 
America to signal retreat and surrender. Indeed, now is not the time 
for the House of Representatives to throw in the towel, wave the white 
flag or signal retreat and surrender in Iraq.

How could this Congress walk away from our men and women in uniform? 
How could we walk away from them now? We must not let that happen. We 
must support our troops. Our failure to learn the lessons of history, 
our failure to lead, will result in devastating consequences, including 
an even greater loss of life and even more resources needed to fight 
tomorrow.




It is absolutely essential that America, the last remaining 
superpower on Earth, continue to be a voice for peace and a beacon of 
freedom in our shrinking world. Walking away would further signal to 
Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, and others that the United States is no 
longer committed to a successful outcome in Iraq.

Before closing my remarks, I want to express my disappointment and 
dismay at yesterday's political and theatrical display by Speaker 
Pelosi and Senator Reid.

The delivery of this conference report to the White House was 
intentionally delayed so the President's veto would coincide with the 
fourth anniversary of the President declaring ''Mission Accomplished.'' 
This display in sending the supplemental to the President was a 
deliberate and shameful attempt at scoring political points solely at 
the expense of our troops.

Mr. Speaker, this veto has been anticipated for some time. The 
majority party has had ample time to plan and prepare for the next 
step. Passing a clean supplemental free of arbitrary deadlines and 
excessive spending is obviously the path we should be following.

There is $20 billion, $20 billion, in this package unrelated to the 
war effort and the gulf coast recovery. That money is designated as 
emergency spending. Every nickel of this unrelated spending should be 
removed from the emergency supplemental. All this spending should be 
debated in regular order through the fiscal year 2008 appropriations 
process.

In closing, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: 
You've made your point. You've had your dog-and-pony show. You have 
posed for political holy pictures on TV. Now what is your plan to 
support the troops?

It is time to put the posturing and political stunts aside and do 
what is in the best interest of our troops. It is time to do the right 
thing and pass a clean emergency supplemental free of arbitrary 
deadlines and arbitrary spending. It is time to support our Commander 
in Chief and sustain the President's veto. I strongly urge a ''no'' 
vote.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
