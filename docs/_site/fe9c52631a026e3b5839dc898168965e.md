Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to funding the war in Iraq, 
President Bush and the House Republicans are willing to write blank 
checks for billions of dollars with absolutely no questions asked. 
After billions misspent and mismanaged, the President is preparing a 
new war funding request for the upcoming year that is expected to cost 
the American taxpayer another $190 billion. Contrast that with the 
disregard both the President and the majority of House Republicans have 
shown towards bipartisan legislation that would ensure that 10 million 
low-income children have access to health insurance.

President Bush has just vetoed a bill that would invest $35 billion 
more in the CHIP program over the next 5 years and allow us to reach 4 
million more children who are already eligible for the program. House 
Republicans will now have to decide if they will once again stand with 
a President who suffers from misguided priorities or if they will 
listen to the American people's will.

I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, it's time to 
stand up for our kids and stand down from a discredited President.
