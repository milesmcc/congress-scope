Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the 
conference report to accompany H.R. 2647, the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.

As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the chairman 
of its Subcommittee on Airland, I had the honor and pleasure again this 
year of working with Chairman Levin and Senator McCain on this bill. I 
congratulate them for working with their House counterparts, Chairman 
Skelton and Representative McKeon, to deliver a bill that will help 
keep our Nation safe and provide our troops with the support they 
deserve.

I also wish to thank Senator Thune, who is my ranking member on the 
Airland Subcommittee, and Chairman Abercrombie and Representative 
Bartlett of the House's Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, for the close 
cooperation we achieved this year on the areas that fall under our 
shared jurisdiction.

There are several accomplishments in this bill of which I am 
especially proud.

This bill will increase the authorized size, known as end strength, 
of our active duty Army from 532,400 to 562,400 for fiscal year 2010, 
and further authorized the Secretary of Defense to increase the Army by 
an additional 30,000 soldiers in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. This 
growth in the Army is essential--our soldiers are under incredible 
strain from multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, oftentimes with 
little more than a year at home to rest and train for every year that 
they spend in theater.

I applaud the President's decision this July to add 22,000 soldiers 
to the Army, and call upon him to use the authority provided in this 
bill to do more. We must ensure that our Army is large enough for all 
the missions we ask of it, and also give our soldiers the time they 
need at home to rest, train, and be with their friends and families.

With regard to missile defense, this bill includes an amendment that 
Senator Sessions and I, along with a bipartisan group of cosponsors, 
introduced to ensure that the administration's new architecture for 
missile defenses in Europe will be as capable as the previous plan that 
was set aside. I believe that this section of the final bill, paired 
with section 8121 of the Senate version of the Defense Appropriations 
Act, which protects funding for the continued development of the two-
stage ground based interceptor, will help to keep our Nation safe 
against Iran's aggressive missile programs.

This bill also makes critical investments in our Nation's sea power. 
It authorizes $4.2 billion for Virginia-class submarines, which will be 
procured at the rate of two per year from 2011, and $495 million for 
the research and development of a replacement to our aging Ohio-class 
strategic deterrence submarines. I am very proud of the skilled workers 
of my home State of Connecticut who build these essential submarines.

Turning to the Army's modernization programs, the final version of 
this bill supports the decision by the Secretary of Defense and the 
Army's leadership to restructure the FCS program. This


bill will provide full funding for the ''Spin Out'' portions of that 
program and the continued development of the network. I look forward to 
working with Senator Thune in the coming year to evaluate the Army's 
revamped strategy for developing and procuring ground combat vehicles 
for our soldiers.

There is one element of this bill with which I must express my deep 
disappointment--the inclusion of $560 million in funds for the 
continued development and procurement of an alternate engine for the F-
35 Joint Strike Fighter.

When the President introduced his plans for reducing spending in the 
budget this May, he specifically pointed out the alternate engine as 
the singular example of programs that ''do nothing to keep us safe--but 
rather prevent us from spending money on what does keep us safe.'' He 
continued to say ''the pentagon does not want--and does not plan to 
use--the alternative version'' to the engine that it already has for 
the Joint Strike Fighter.

Since the President's initial comments on this unnecessary and 
wasteful program, the Secretary of Defense and the uniformed military 
leadership have explained exactly why they do not want this 
unnecessary, alternate engine. It is because they know the danger this 
earmark poses to the Joint Strike Fighter, which is planned to be the 
cornerstone of American air power for decades to come.

If Congress forced the Defense Department to continue paying for an 
alternate engine, it would cost an additional $4 to $6 billion over 
just the next 5 years--billions of dollars that the Department has not 
planned for, and that would either have to come from the Joint Strike 
Fighter or other critical programs to keep our country safe.

If Congress forced the Defense Department to procure the alternate 
engine that it does not want, it would prevent the Joint Strike Fighter 
program from achieving economies of scale for years to come, as it 
split its procurement to maintain two manufacturing lines. The costs of 
the program would rise, along with the risk that it will never deliver 
the aircraft that our Nation requires.

When he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in June, 
Air Force LTG Mark Shackelford explained that these added costs would 
mean that the Air Force would be able to afford some 53 fewer of the 
Joint Strike Fighter aircraft that it needs to support our airmen.

In response to the President's strong arguments and the concerns of 
our military leadership, the Senate put this question to a vote in on 
July 23, deciding by a vote of 59-38 to end the unnecessary, alternate 
engine. Although the House never took similar action on this topic, the 
Senate receded to its position in conference.

I call upon President Obama to send a clear message to our colleagues 
on the Appropriations committee--that he will veto an appropriations 
bill that includes funds for this unnecessary program. Fifty-nine 
Members of this body stood by the President when he first called upon 
us to end this program, and I am sure that we will stand by him again.

Despite this strong reservation, I call upon my colleagues to vote 
for the adoption this conference report and again thank my colleagues 
on the Armed Services Committee for their hard work on behalf of our 
service men and women.
