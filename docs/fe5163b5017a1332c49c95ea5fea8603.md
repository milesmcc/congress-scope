Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman.

Madam Speaker, I now would like to point out to the gentleman, as all 
of us know, that our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan have spent the last 
29 days waiting for this Congress to authorize the funding that they 
need to execute their mission to maintain not only their own safety, 
but the safety of us here at home. We have heard reports since last 
night that the war funding bill and its provision and primary mission 
of funding the troops has now been somewhat eclipsed by provisions 
which have no relation to protecting and supporting our troops in the 
field. So I would ask the gentleman, could he confirm, number one, that 
$108 billion--scored at $5 billion by the Congressional Budget Office--
whether that money for the IMF will be included in the troop funding 
bill? Number two, are the reports correct which have indicated that the 
provisions prohibiting the release of detainee photos has now been 
stripped from the measure that we will consider? And thirdly, could the 
gentleman confirm that the conference report coming to the House will 
now allow for the transfer of the Guantanamo detainees into the United 
States?

And I yield.
