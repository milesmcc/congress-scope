Mr. TESTER. Madam President, the Senate has a real opportunity today 
to do right by our newest veterans who have served us well in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

When our troops came home at the end of World War II, our Nation made 
a choice to make college a reality for millions of them. Nearly 8 
million veterans--half of all who served in that war--took advantage of 
the Montgomery GI bill. They had their college education paid for. Our 
country made a decision to invest in our warriors' future as they 
returned from the battlefield. As a result, the ''greatest generation'' 
produced broad-based growth and prosperity.

Today, we are great at sending our troops off to war, but we are 
coming up short in providing the benefits their service has earned. 
That is shortsighted and wrong.

A very small percentage of Americans actually serve in our Armed 
Forces, the military, on Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard. It 
totals less than 3 million people in a country of 300 million.

So far, 1.6 million troops have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tens 
of thousands more of our troops will rotate through in the coming 
months. These men and women and their families are the ones who have 
borne the sacrifice of 15-month deployments, multiple tours of combat 
zones, injuries, and the loss of far too many of their battle buddies.

It is right that the Senate give back to them by giving them a GI 
bill that meets today's needs. It is time to treat doing right by our 
veterans as a true cost of war. These folks all joined the service 
because they love their country, they want to serve, and they want to 
be a part of all the great work our military does. It is hardly 
glamorous, but it is critical to our Nation.

A GI bill that provides our troops the full cost of a college 
education is a vital recruiting tool, and it helps us give back to the 
people who are serving our country.

Today, nearly one-third of all Active-Duty servicemembers who signed 
up for the GI bill never use the benefit. There are many good reasons, 
but one of the main reasons is that the current GI bill doesn't provide 
enough benefit to meet the needs of today's veterans.

Madam President, today's GI bill is woefully inadequate. It only 
provides about $9,000 in costs for an academic year of college. When 
you factor in tuition, room, board, books, and other living expenses, 
that is only about 70 percent of the actual cost of attending a 
university such as the University of Montana. It is only a drop in the 
bucket for a private school.

The Webb amendment that we have before us today fully covers the cost 
of any instate public school's tuition and fees, and it creates a 
matching program to help create incentive for private schools to do the 
right thing and pay for a veteran's education. It will stay this way 
for a generation. This legislation is tied to the cost of public 
education so the benefit to our veterans will keep pace with the annual 
rise in tuition and fees, which have averaged about 6 percent over the 
last decade.


Another thing that makes this amendment so important is that for the 
first time it brings the National Guard and reservists more access to 
the GI bill. Right now, few guardsmen and reservists can get the full 
benefit. Given how much we have relied on the Guard in Iraq, I think 
that is wrong.

Let me also say we know the vast majority of servicemen sign up for 
the GI bill, but that has a cost. When you first receive a paycheck 
from the military, you have to decide whether to spend $100 a month for 
the first year on buying into the GI bill benefit. That is a total cost 
of $1,200. Now, $100 may not seem much to some folks in Washington, DC, 
but I guarantee you that to an airman just out of basic and on his or 
her first tour at a base such as Malmstrom Air Force Base, that $100 is 
a big deal. The Webb GI bill gets rid of that fee, and it is about time 
we did so.

Finally, I wish to address one of the complaints about the Webb bill. 
Some have said the Webb bill will hurt retention, especially in the 
mid-career officer corps. This is simply untrue. A commissioned officer 
would have to serve 8 or 9 years before being fully eligible for the 
new enhanced GI benefit. It is not the GI bill that causes mid-career 
folks to leave the military. It is 15-month deployments, multiple 
tours, and stop-loss involuntary deployment extensions, the so-called 
back-door draft.



So I hope we can get this done today. This bill will cost about $2 
billion a year, and that is a little less than we spend in Iraq in 1 
week.

Keep in mind that, over a lifetime, the average individual who goes 
to college earns more than $500,000 more than someone who does not. 
This is the right thing to do for our troops, but it is also a good 
investment in our country's future, especially at a time when the 
economy is sputtering, wages are stagnant, and jobs are being lost. So 
I call on this body to stand by our Nation's warriors and to pass a 
21st century GI bill. It is the right thing to do.

I yield the floor.
