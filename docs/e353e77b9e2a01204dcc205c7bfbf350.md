Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to welcome back our 
colleague, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who has returned from a trip 
to Iraq and Afghanistan with Senators Obama and Hagel. I know he has 
made many trips there and I thank him for his service in the Senate and 
his contact with our troops and we are glad to have him back.

Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic side?
