# PAKISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support 
H. Con. Res. 301, calling on the President to withdraw U.S. Troops from 
Pakistan, and oppose H.R. 4899, the supplemental spending bill.

The right way to foster democracy and opportunity in the region is to 
invest in infrastructure like schools and roads. The book ''Stones into 
Schools'' details how building schools in remote regions of Afghanistan 
and Pakistan opened up opportunities for young men and women, and 
helped promote peace. This is the type of aid we should be giving--not 
tanks and missiles.

H. Con. Res. 301 would take a step in the right direction. With drone 
attacks killing civilians in Pakistan, a Gallup poll from August 2009 
shows that 59 percent of Pakistanis see the United States as their 
biggest threat. The recent documents posted on WikiLeaks show that 
Pakistan Intelligence has been working with the Taliban against U.S. 
troops. We need to stop aggressive military actions in Pakistan before 
the conflict escalates.

The supplemental spending bill is the wrong approach. It would add 
$37 billion to the deficit to finance an additional 30,000 troops in 
Afghanistan. After nine years at war, we have little to show for our 
efforts despite $232 billion spent, over a thousand American lives 
lost, and tens of thousands of Afghan civilians dead.

I urge my colleagues to stand for peace, vote for H. Con. Res. 301 to 
withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan, and vote against the supplemental 
spending bill.
