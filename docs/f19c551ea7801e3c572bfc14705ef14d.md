Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, SSG Eric D. Cottrell, a native 
of Pittsview, Alabama, was killed during an IED attack on August 13th 
in Qayyarah, Iraq. Staff Sergeant Cottrell was assigned to the 5th 
Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st 
Cavalry Division stationed in Fort Bliss, Texas.

Words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family, and 
the gratitude our country feels for his service. Eric, like other brave 
men and women who have served in uniform, died serving not just the 
United States, but the entire cause of liberty. Indeed, like those who 
have served before him, he was a true American.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve our nation. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the 
House's remembrance at this mournful occasion.
