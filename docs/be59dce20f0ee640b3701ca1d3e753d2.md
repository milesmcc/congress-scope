# MAKING EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS MOTION TO PROCEED
## `be59dce20f0ee640b3701ca1d3e753d2`
`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 15 November 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I understand that the majority may 
move to proceed to the supplemental bill passed by the House last 
night. That bill imposes at least two policy restrictions that will 
compel a veto: directing the readiness standard the Defense Department 
must follow before a unit may be deployed, and expanding the 
interrogation procedures established in the Army Field Manual over to 
the intelligence community.

The House bill will also compel the immediate withdrawal of forces, 
regardless of what General Petraeus's orders may be. Petraeus has 
established a reasonable timeline for the transition of mission and 
drawdown, and, frankly, we ought to support him. The Marine 
expeditionary unit identified by General Petraeus in September for 
withdrawal has left Iraq, and an Army brigade is headed home over the 
next month.
















 cloture motion


Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 484, S. 2340, the 
troop funding bill. I send a cloture motion to the desk.
