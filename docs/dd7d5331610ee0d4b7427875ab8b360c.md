# AVOID MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Ms. JENKINS. ''This is not a war of choice. This is a war of 
necessity.'' But just 7 weeks after the President spoke those words, 
White House political advisers consider rejecting General McChrystal's 
assessment.

To win in Afghanistan, we must provide the general the resources he 
needs. Insufficient troop levels is a mistake that must not be 
repeated.

Servicemembers from my district from Fort Leavenworth, Fort Riley, 
and the Kansas National Guard are putting their lives on the line in 
this war of necessity. As the President decides on his strategy in 
Afghanistan, I remind him of his words.

Leaving our brave soldiers in Afghanistan without the resources they 
need is indefensible. Our duty is to avoid the mistakes of the past.

Mr. President, please listen to the generals you have placed in 
command.
