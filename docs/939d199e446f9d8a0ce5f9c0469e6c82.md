Mrs. CUBIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Shane Stanfield of 
Cheyenne, Wyoming, who was killed in Iraq while serving his nation. It 
is with deep sadness today that I join Shane's family in mourning their 
loss.

Shane Stanfield entered into military service on behalf of his 
country in 2000, eventually serving with honor and distinction in 
Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom as a proud member of the 
United States Marine Corps. In 2004, Shane left the active duty 
military but continued serving his country as a private security 
officer. Shane was killed while protecting American personnel during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom on January 23, 2007.

Shane was only 25 years old. He is remembered both for his love of 
adventure and for his hardworking nature. Shane may be best remembered, 
however, for his kindness toward everyone he met.

We must never forget the sacrifice made by Shane Stanfield, or the 
countless other soldiers, who willingly place the safety and well being 
of the nation above their own. Shane Stanfield was a beloved husband, 
son, brother, uncle, nephew, and dear friend to those left behind. His 
family members and friends selflessly parted with him during his 
service to our nation.

We recognize that our deepest gratitude cannot possibly begin to 
diminish Shane Stanfield's absence, but his memory will live on in the 
hearts of our nation's citizens. I hope that this knowledge will 
provide his family with some measure of comfort as they work to find 
healing in Shane's remembrance.
