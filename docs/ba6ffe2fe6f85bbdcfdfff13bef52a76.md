Mr. CANTOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank the students and 
teachers of Monacan High School in Chesterfield County, Virginia, for 
collecting and shipping much needed school supplies for students in 
Afghanistan.

Jessica M. Heising, an English teacher at Monacan High, organized 
Project 186 with the purpose of collecting 186 backpacks and school 
supplies for each student in an all-girls school in the Paktika 
province of Afghanistan. The project was successful, and the supplies 
will improve the learning outcomes of the 186 students.

I commend the teachers, students, faculty, and families who gave of 
their time and talents to influence the lives of students in 
Afghanistan for good.
