 Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in early August, I was informed that 
an Idaho Army National Guard Unit from eastern Idaho was awarded one of 
the U.S. Army's highest commendations, the Meritorious Unit 
Commendation. The First Battalion, 148th Field Artillery Unit based in 
Pocatello served as part of the Idaho Army National Guard's 116th 
Cavalry Brigade combat team in 2004 and 2005 in Iraq. Although part of 
a combat brigade, these citizen soldiers are doctors, dentists, 
electricians, lawyers, and other occupations as Idaho civilians. BG 
Alay Gayhart, Assistant Adjutant Army General for the Idaho Army 
National Guard, has rightly noted that these men and women utilized 
their civilian occupational skills in Iraq to help restore civic and 
governmental services to the country. I am honored to call myself a 
fellow Idahoan of these brave men and women, some of whom I had the 
pleasure of meeting prior to their deployment when they were at Fort 
Bliss, TX, at the end of the summer in 2004. I congratulate them on 
their professionalism, commitment to our mission, and am happy for 
their safe return to family and friends. I also keep the families and 
friends of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in prayer as they 
continue on without their loved ones.

Idaho has a proud history of military service. Her sons and daughters 
have been serving our Nation in uniform far from home since the days of 
the Spanish American War in the early 20th century. The deployment of 
the 116th Cavalry Brigade combat team from 2004 to 2005 was the largest 
deployment of the Idaho Army National Guard in history.

The Meritorious Unit Commendation is awarded to military commands 
that display exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of 
outstanding service, heroic deed, or valorous actions. The unit was 
recommended for the award by the U.S. Army's higher headquarters and 
was selected by the Pentagon for the commendations.
