`Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 13 March 2007`

---


Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Congressman Price, for 
giving me an opportunity to join you today. And, Mr. Kline, thank you 
for your leadership in the Congress and in the military. I appreciate 
it so very much.

Congressman Price, as you well know, none of us want to be in war; I 
certainly don't want to be in a war. But the fact is, we are in a war 
on terror. As a matter of fact, I think back right after September 11, 
2001, the first casualty in Afghanistan was Sergeant Davis from my 
district. A distant family member, the first casualty in the war on 
terror after we decided that we were going to join the battle. As you 
well know, that battle didn't start on September 11. This is not a war 
just limited to Iraq. This war has been going on a long time. It is a 
global war on terror. This war has been going on for a long time, and 
it was started by radical Islamic extremists.

This war didn't start on September 11. It has been going on for a 
long time. Many of you can remember the Iranian hostage crisis. In 
1979, 52 Americans were held for 444 days until we had a President that 
finally came to office and said we are going to have a backbone and we 
are going to take on the terrorists, and those 52 Americans were set 
free.

Then we had the bombing of the Beirut barracks in 1983 where 241 
Americans were killed.

Then we had the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. So 
you are starting to see a trend here. This war really didn't start on 
September 11, and it is really not a war that is limited to Iraq.

Then we step forward in time to the year 2000, the bombing of the USS 
Cole. Seventeen sailors were killed.

Finally, September 11, 2001, almost 3,000 Americans were killed. How 
soon we forget.

I certainly haven't forgotten. I am sure that the family members of 
those 3,000 haven't forgotten, and I hope the American people and the 
Congress and the majority in the Congress never forget those 3,000 
people that were killed.

We are going to be fighting this battle somewhere. We are in a war 
with a people that hate us; terrorists that hate us. They hate our 
freedoms; and, quite frankly, I think they hate our religion.

The extremists engaged us in battle. We owe it to our fellow citizens 
to see that we have nothing less than total victory. We can and we must 
win this war on terror. We simply cannot allow this Congress to move 
forward with a slow-bleed strategy. We must not cut off funding for our 
troops.

I spent several hours last week at Walter Reed Medical Center, and I 
had the opportunity to see men and women in uniform. Many of them had 
lost limbs. Many of them had internal injuries. We owe them nothing 
less than total victory. We asked them to go protect us. I can't 
imagine a Congress and a government of the United States not standing 
behind them to make sure that they also have victory.

America cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past by 
withdrawing from a direct confrontation of the radical Islamic 
extremists. They will stop at nothing to destroy America. They have 
proved that.

You know, I can remember when people said they have fought over 
there, they have been fighting over there for thousands of years, why 
are we over there? The reason we are over there is because they came 
over here. They brought the war to us, and they have been bringing the 
war to us for well over 30 years. This is not something we can turn our 
backs on.

I have spoken to the men and women in uniform as they have returned, 
and I can tell you to a person, every one of them said we are doing the 
right things. We need to stay there. We need to finish this job.

Can you imagine being a soldier over there and knowing that the 
Congress has the potential to pass a law that we could pull out in 18 
months. Can you imagine being a soldier over there at 17 months, 3 
weeks, 4 days, and you are on patrol and knowing you can lose your life 
or your limb, but in 3 days you are going to be pulled out and we are 
going to lose the war anyway. I can't imagine being a soldier that is 
being asked to do that. We need to have soldiers that understand that 
we are going to be there for them because they are there for us.

The consequences of failure in Iraq would be tragic for America and 
for the entire world. If we retreat, the enemy will follow. Our 
decisions now regarding how we handle this global war on terror will 
affect future generations. We have the duty to pursue nothing less than 
victory.

The good news is the surge is working. It is already taking place. 
For instance, Brian Williams, anchor of NBC News, hardly a news group 
that typically sides with Republicans, recently reported a dramatic 
change in Ramadi. The city is now safer, according to Mr. Williams.

It is already working. How can we be talking about cutting and 
running and failing on this critical issue?

We need to stop campaigning on the floor of the House, and we need to 
get about allowing the generals to be the military leaders.

As you pointed out just moments ago, there is one Commander in Chief, 
not 535. Congress should not micromanage this war, and we need to let 
our military leaders do just that, lead. That is what they are called 
to do.

General Petraeus just weeks ago received unanimous approval in the 
Senate, and a week later you have Senators and Congressmen and 
Congresswomen saying we don't want to listen to what he says. Actually 
what he is telling us to do is send in the troops.

It is almost like the cavalry. If you can remember growing up, the 
trumpet would sound, the bugle would alert, and you would bring in the 
troops to win the battle. We need to do that same thing.

What we have been doing over the last few years has actually worked 
again. The United States has been able to prevent further terrorist 
attacks on our homeland since 2001. We did it by taking the fight to 
them. They have proven they are going to fight us somewhere, it is 
either over there or over here. I would much rather keep them busy over 
there if they want to continue the fight.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may have the votes to 
defund the war, bring the troops home, and not use the word 
''retreat.'' But if we leave before the job is finished, we have 
retreated. It is simple. We either win this war or we lose this war.

The good people of the First District of Tennessee and I support the 
efforts of our troops and we support winning this global war on terror. 
We can do no less.
