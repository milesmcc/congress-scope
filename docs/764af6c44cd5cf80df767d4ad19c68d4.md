Mr. CHANDLER. And for the troops.

You mentioned a very important word, and that word is stewardship. 
That is what we owe to the people of this country, we owe them 
stewardship. We must be good stewards. And job one is to take care of 
their hard-earned resources that they send up here to Washington. And 
in this case, we are sending an incredible amount of those resources 
over to Iraq and nobody is watching what is happening with them. Nobody 
is holding that process accountable.

And I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his efforts to 
bring light to this subject. I think it is very, very important. We 
need to continue to talk about this until something is done.



I am glad to see my colleague here from Georgia (Mr. Scott), who I 
know has come down here on a number of occasions to talk about this 
subject. He is a fine, fine member of our coalition. I am glad to be 
here with Mr. Scott, and I know he has a word or two to say about this 
also.
