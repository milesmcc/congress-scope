Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, an analysis of the accomplishments under 
Democrat control here in Congress for the 110th Congress has shown that 
not much has been accomplished. Let's take a look at it. There have 
been a thousand votes taken this year. When you look at those thousand 
votes, only 106 bills have been signed by the President. What are those 
bills? Well, 46 were naming of post offices, public buildings and 
bridges. Not much accomplishment there. And 44 bills were 
noncontroversial. Some were actually Republican bills. They had strong 
bipartisan support.

Fourteen of these bills were reauthorization of existing law that the 
Republicans developed and were just continuing. And two substantial, 
serious bills that passed this House, the FISA bill and the Iraq 
supplemental, passed without one member of the Democrat leadership 
supporting it.

That is all that has been accomplished, and I think the American 
people need to know. Lastly, not one appropriation bill has been sent 
to the President and the fiscal year is already over.
