Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, after 9/11, the 9/11 Commission 
recommended that in light of the terrorism our country faces, we begin 
to study how we can have more secure identification cards. A number of 
the terrorists had stolen cards or had fraudulent cards or had ID cards 
that were not real.

As a result of that, the Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and 
Terrorism Prevention Act at the end of 2004 which established a process 
by which we could look at the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. It 
established a negotiated rule-making process.

Because most of the ideas about ID cards involved State and local 
governments, all of them involved issues of privacy, all of them 
involved the possibility of great inconvenience to most Americans, this 
negotiated rule-making process would basically create a seat at the 
table for representatives of all the affected groups and try to work 
out the most sensible thing to do.

I have historically been opposed to the idea of an ID card. When I 
was Governor of Tennessee, I twice vetoed the photo driver's license 
bill because I thought it was an infringement on liberty. But the 
legislature overrode me, I accepted it, and today, after 9/11, I agree 
it would be wise for our country, with a combination of terrorism and 
the difficulties within immigration, to have more secure identification 
cards.

The question is, which one? Then suddenly, in 2005, along came an 
appropriations bill for our troops, and in the middle of it, the House 
of Representatives stuck something called the REAL ID Act, which set 
minimum standards for State driver's licenses as an effort to deter 
terrorists from easily obtaining that form of identification.

Well, that could be a good idea. But there are 245 million Americans 
with driver's licenses or ID cards. Many of us send those in by mail or 
online to renew them. Last year in the State of Tennessee, for example, 
there were 1.7 million driver's licenses issued. There are 53 driver's 
license identification stations. I believe the only group of people who 
could have passed REAL ID in the dead of the night, without any 
hearings, were Congressmen who had never been to a driver's license 
examining station in Tennessee or maybe in their own State, because 
these are not State employees who are trained in catching terrorists. 
They are not equipped to deal with the large number of new 
responsibilities, in a State which is going to have REAL ID, that 
include having to come in person to that driver's license office and 
show a number of documents, including the Social Security card and a 
valid U.S. passport.

We would have to prove, I would have to prove, that I am lawfully a 
citizen of the United States. Our family has been here for 12 
generations. Senator Salazar has been here for 13 generations. The 
Presiding Officer has written a book about the number of generations 
his family has been here. We would have to go down to one of these 
driver's license stations and prove we belonged here. Nobody else ever 
had to do that before in my family that I know about. But in an age of 
terrorism, we might have to do that.

At the very least, I would think we would want to do one of two 
things: One would be that in the Senate, in the Homeland Security 
Committee or other appropriate committees, we might want to think about 
whether there might be other ways to come up with a better secure 
identification card, rather than add that to the burden of the driver's 
license.

For example, most of the problems that surround the immigration bill 
have to do with work, people coming into this country illegally to get 
a job. That is what most of it is about. Senator Schumer and Senator 
Graham have a piece of legislation that would create a secure Social 
Security card.

Now, I wonder if, over a period of years, having workers with a 
Social Security card that is secure, includes biometrics, and a good 
employer verification system, might not be a more sensible way for us 
to improve the question of whether we have secure identification cards.

There is the idea of more passports. Already we have a backlog 
because of the number of American who are getting a passport. But 
passports are a more secure identification. Maybe there should be a 
secure travel card we could use when we travel on airplanes. For 
example, there are a couple million


of us at a time who are up in the air. If we all had one of those 
cards, you begin to add all those up--you may have some driver's 
licenses that are more secure, a secure work card, a passport and a 
travel card, a variety of secure cards would begin to avoid the terrors 
we imagine from a ''Big Brother'' national ID card.


We remember what happened with that sort of thing in Nazi Germany and 
in South Africa, where you had to carry around a wallet and a portfolio 
describing how mixed your blood might be so they can determine your 
race. We do not want that in the United States.

So that would be the kind of discussion we should have had in 
hearings before any of this was adopted. We were going to have that 
with the negotiated rule-making process, before suddenly this so-called 
REAL ID card comes through here at night and we have to vote for it, up 
or down, or not send any money to support the troops fighting in Iraq 
and Afghanistan.

We can get an idea of what the REAL ID surge might cost by looking at 
what is happening right now with the passport backlog in the United 
States. There were 12 million passports issued in 2006. This year there 
are going to be 17 million because of new travel requirements. The 
Passport Office employees are working hard, but they grossly 
underestimated, or we did, what the new demand would be.

As a result, there was a backlog of 3 million passports in March. 
Today it is 2.3 million. The turnaround time used to be 6 weeks, now it 
is 12 to 14 weeks on regular service and 4 to 6 on expedited service. 
We have destroyed summer vacations, we have ruined weddings and 
honeymoon plans, we have disrupted business meetings and educational 
trips. People lost days of work waiting in line. If we think the 
passport backlog has created consternation, imagine what it is going to 
be like when 245 million Americans, many who have been used to renewing 
their driver's licenses by mail, many who have thought of themselves 
and their parents and grandparents as good, legal Americans, have to go 
to their driver's license station with a pack of documents and prove 
they are legally here.

Then they might get right up to the door and somebody says: You 
forgot one thing, and they have to go all the way back home, get it, 
and stand back in line again. I bet we get more calls on that than we 
did on immigration.

There is another problem I would like to describe. It is one I am 
trying to address with this amendment. I am trying to provide three 
hundred million dollars next year to help States who wish to comply 
with REAL ID pay for it. Now, not all States will take advantage of 
this because 17 States have already
