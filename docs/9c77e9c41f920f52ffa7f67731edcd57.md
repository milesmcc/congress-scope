Mrs. JONES of Ohio. In conjunction with what my colleague has already 
said, can you imagine that of the amount of money we spend in Iraq, we 
could put in place 4,072,709 additional housing units nationwide? In 
Ohio, we could put 142,849. Imagine this, right in the city of 
Cleveland where we have 2,185 homeless, we could take care of them and 
they would not have to be homeless.

Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield time to my colleague 
and good friend who has been at the forefront of issues around this 
war, the Congresswoman from California, Congresswoman Barbara Lee. And 
I yield to her 5 minutes.
