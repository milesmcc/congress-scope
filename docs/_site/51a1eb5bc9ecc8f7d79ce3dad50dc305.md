`Mr. SHADEGG â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

And just to follow up, I was going to actually begin my remarks 
tonight by noting the tremendous speech I thought that was given by my 
colleague Mr. McHugh, I believe it was the night before last, in the 
midst of this important debate. And I think this is an extremely 
important debate. Indeed, I think this is the most important debate in 
my 12 years in the United States Congress and I would assert the most 
important debate this Congress may, indeed, ever have.

But with regard to being unpatriotic, I want to make my position 
clear and I want to reference what Mr. McHugh said.

First, I respect every Member on the other side of the aisle, and I 
respect


their right to express their views. And, quite frankly, the other 
evening when I spoke in this debate, I said I respect and share their 
frustration, both at where we are in this war and how we got there.

But the gentleman pointed out that he hadn't heard anybody labeled 
unpatriotic. I think Mr. McHugh's comments were quite in tone with what 
I have heard in the portion of this debate that I have watched, and I 
have watched a lot. And he said, ''I have listened today with great 
interest, and I have enormous respect for Members on both sides of the 
aisle.'' I have that respect. I have the respect for the sincerity of 
my colleagues on both sides of this aisle. We have, however, an 
important disagreement which deserves to be aired.

I think there is an important question that needs to be asked. That 
question is, if we do not defeat radical jihadists in Iraq, the radical 
Islamists with whom we are at war there now, if we do not defeat them 
in Iraq, then where? And if we do not defeat them now, then when?

Let me first start by making a few points about the record and 
setting the record straight. My colleague from Texas pointed out a few 
moments ago that we are each entitled to our own opinion, but not to 
our own facts. I would suggest that there is a fact across this Nation, 
an accepted fact, which is flat untrue. And it was referred to in the 
debate here just a few moments ago. And that is the notion that Shia 
and Sunni have been at war with each other for hundreds of years and 
killing each other for hundreds of years.

Today, the bipartisan Antiterrorism Caucus met, and we heard from an 
expert from Brookings, and he said that is simply not true. The notion 
that we are in the midst of a civil war that has gone on for hundreds 
of years simply is not true. It is not a fact.

What is a fact is that we face an extraordinary enemy, an enemy that 
hates us, an enemy that has been taught a set of beliefs that requires 
them to kill us; that requires them to kill all Americans, all 
Westerners, all unbelievers; indeed, a radical jihadist sect that calls 
for them to kill many Muslims and to do so without excuse. To break all 
law in doing so. To ignore international law in doing so.

I would call my colleagues to read this book, ''Knowing the Enemy'' 
by Mary Habeck. I read it after she spoke to the bipartisan 
Antiterrorism Caucus. I want to read a few paragraphs out of this book 
because I believe it is important to understand: ''Jihadist ideologues 
use this generally accepted belief to argue that their interpretation 
of Islam is also intended for the entire world, which must be brought 
to recognize this fact peacefully if possible and through violence if 
not.''

We have been told over and over and over and over again that these 
jihadists, the radical jihadists, hate us. In the debate earlier on 
this floor I asked my colleagues, I asked anyone on either side of the 
aisle, if you can name for me a single radical jihadi leader who has 
said that if America leaves Iraq, if America will pull back from Iraq, 
the war will end? I have asked that question on this floor at least 
twice, maybe three times, and nobody has taken it up. And the answer is 
because that is not what they want.

I listened to the debate here tonight and I respect it. As I said, I 
share the frustration over where we are in this war. But if you listen 
carefully to this debate, what you hear is: well, if we will stop, the 
war will end. I am afraid it is not that true. I am afraid it is not 
that easy. I am afraid it is not that simple. If we were to stop, the 
war would not end.

Listen to the words of al Qaeda, the words of Osama bin Laden, the 
words of Ayman al Zawahiri. Over and over and over again, they have 
told us that that would not be the end of the war. Indeed, it would not 
end their war against us.

Let me talk first about Ayman al Zawahiri. Here is his quote: ''It is 
jihad for the sake of God and will last until our religion prevails . . 
. The entire world is an open battlefield for us. We will attack 
everywhere until Islam reigns.''

Osama bin Laden: ''The whole world is watching this war and the two 
adversaries; the Islamic Nation on the one hand and the United States 
and its allies on the other. It is either victory and glory or misery 
and humiliation.''



Ayman al-Zawahiri again: ''The jihad in Iraq requires several 
incremental goals; expel the Americans from Iraq, establish an Islamic 
authority or amarat, extend the jihad to secular countries neighboring 
Iraq, and then the clash with Israel.''

And last, Osama bin Laden: ''Hostility toward America is a religious 
duty. We hope to be rewarded by God for it. I am confident that Muslims 
will be able to end the legend of the so-called superpower that is 
America.''

There is no end to this war simply because we choose to stop 
fighting. It will not go away.

Let me refer again to Mary Habeck and ''Knowing the Enemy,'' which, 
Mr. Speaker, I hope you have read and all others who participate in 
this debate will read.

''The three main jihadist ideologues make clear a central point of 
the ongoing war with falsehood: That it will continue until Islam has 
liberated the entire world from darkness, tyranny and servitude. 
Jihadists thus neither recognize national boundaries within the Islamic 
lands, nor do they believe that the coming Islamic state when it is 
created should have permanent borders with unbelievers. The recognition 
of such boundaries would end the expansion of Islam and stop offensive 
jihad, both of which are transgressions against the laws of God that 
command jihad to last until judgment day or until the entire Earth is 
under the rule of Islamic law.''

It would be nice if we could ask this war to go away, but it won't. 
So I ask again, if you do not want to confront radical jihadists in 
Iraq, then where? And if not now, then when?

This war did not begin in 2003. It began not in 2001 with the attack 
on the World Trade Center. No. We have been at war with these radical 
jihadists for decades. In 1979, radical jihadists seized the American 
embassy in Tehran and held American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, 
radical jihadists attacked the Marine barracks in Beirut; 241 were 
murdered. In 1988, they brought down Pan Am Flight 103, known as the 
Lockerbie bombing; 270 were murdered. In 1993, Islamic terrorists 
attacked the World Trade Center for the first time; six were murdered. 
In 1996, they attacked the Khobar Towers. I have been to Khobar Towers 
before it was brought down. I saw where they killed 19 U.S. servicemen. 
1998, al Qaeda attacked the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. They 
killed 212 in Tanzania and 11 were murdered in Kenya. In 2000, the 
Islamic terrorists attacked the USS Cole and 17 are murdered there. 
2001, they attacked New York, Washington and Pennsylvania and they 
killed 3,000.

This war is the heart of the war on terror, and if we do not confront 
them now, then when? If we do not confront them in Iraq, then where?

There have been parallels to prior wars. I would suggest that this 
debate is similar, very similar, to the debate that led up to our 
involvement both in the World War I and World War II. Men of goodwill 
do like not to engage in war. It would be nice to have been able to 
believe that Hitler would go away, and well-meaning Americans argued 
that we should stay out of that war. But ultimately we couldn't, 
because ultimately the Japanese empire attacked us at Pearl Harbor and 
we recognized that we had to be involved in that war.

I would suggest to you that that is where we are now, and I would 
suggest to you that there is no such thing when you are at war as a 
nonbinding resolution, and there is no such thing as a resolution that 
does not do damage to the morale our troops.

Let me conclude, if I might, just by pointing out that this 
resolution may send a message to the White House, and I understand and 
sympathize with the desire to do that. But the more important message 
it will send is to our allies around the world that America cannot be 
trusted, that America cannot be relied upon, that America is an ally 
that will leave.

Osama bin Laden has said it over and over and over again: Attack 
them, fight them. Ultimately they will grow weak and they will back 
down.
