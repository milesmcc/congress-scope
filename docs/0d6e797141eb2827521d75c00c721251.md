Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker and colleagues, I rise today to speak about 
a bill that I have just introduced that recognizes and honors the 
service and sacrifice of many members of the United States Armed Forces 
who fought in Vietnam, H.R. 4720, the ''In Memory Medal for Forgotten 
Veterans Act''.

Those so recognized are veterans who have died as a result of their 
service in the Vietnam War but who do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion on The Wall of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. 
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund has a program called ''In Memory'' 
which has raised money for a plaque that has been placed near The Wall. 
The plaque honors ''those who served in the Vietnam War and later died 
as a result of their service''. No names are on the plaque, but all 
names are kept in the ''In Memory Book'' at a kiosk near The Wall, and 
families can order a copy.

My bill adds to this recognition by presenting the families of these 
veterans with a medal, to be known as the ''Jesus (Chuchi) Salgado 
Medal'' to be issued by the Secretary of Defense. Chuchi Salgado was an 
outstanding individual who lived in my Congressional district, whose 
exposure to Agent Orange ultimately led to his death. His relatives 
continue to live in my district.

Because of the boundaries that have been set for the names to be 
placed on The Wall, Chuchi and many, many other Vietnam veterans are 
not honored in this manner. Now, with new veterans coming back from 
Iraq and Afghanistan, we are all taking a second look and a closer look 
at how veterans from past wars have been treated. While we must care 
for the newer veterans, we must also take this opportunity to do right 
by veterans of Vietnam, along with other past wars and conflicts.

I invite my colleagues to join with me in honoring these veterans. It 
is critical that we remember those who have fought so gallantly and 
sacrificed their lives for our freedom! Please join me in supporting 
H.R. 4720.
