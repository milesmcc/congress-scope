Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Israel and Ms. Lee for bringing 
this amendment. We all have our eyes focused on the warfighting 
theaters in Iraq and Afghanistan, and if we turn our focus to Darfur 
and look at the history and the number of deaths which number, and the 
estimates I have seen are between 250,000 and 400,000, many of them 
inflicted by this so-called janjaweed militia which comes into villages 
in Darfur and ravages the village, burns them, we have seen the 
pictures that have been circulated by our own Member, Mr. Wolf, and by 
Senator Brownback from their recent trips, which show burned-out 
villages with the women abused, with many of the villagers killed, some 
of them killed by strafings, by helicopter gunships which have been 
purchased from China and from Russia, with small arms sales taking 
place specifically from the Chinese and the Russians. And we see a 
situation in which the Free World and the civilized world has not been 
able to have much of an effect.

I'd ask Mr. Israel, my colleague, of your take on this very difficult 
situation.
