 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay 
tribute to LTC Craig M. Greene, deputy chief, Army Senate Liaison 
Division, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, who will retire 
September 1, 2008. I wish to commend and congratulate Lieutenant 
Colonel Craig Greene upon his retirement.

Lieutenant Colonel Greene's distinguished career as an infantry 
officer embodies all of the Army's values of loyalty, duty, respect, 
honor, integrity, and personal courage and spans 20 years, during which 
he has distinguished himself as both a soldier and leader.

Upon graduating from the University of Massachusetts, Lieutenant 
Colonel Greene served as an infantry officer in command and staff 
positions in a number of infantry units. Prior to Lieutenant Colonel 
Greene's assignment to the Office of Chief of Legislative Liaison, he 
was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, Light, Schofield Barracks, 
HI, from 2001 to 2003. His experience in the Army's Officer Personnel 
Management Command led to Lieutenant Colonel Greene being selected to 
serve as the brigade S-1 for the 2nd Brigade ''Warriors'' and the 
secretary to the General Staff for the Commanding General. The 
consummate professional, Lieutenant Colonel Greene revised internal 
systems to streamline information flow and the decisionmaking process 
to include instituting a ''Battle Rhythm'' for the division staff 
eliminating redundant meetings and events.

In his more recent position as a congressional liaison, I have come 
to know and respect Lieutenant Colonel Greene. A natural at building 
and maintaining relationships with Members of Congress and their 
staffs, Lieutenant Colonel Greene was invaluable as the Army faced many 
challenges associated with its budget and real-world combat operations 
in the global war on terror. Members knew they could count on 
Lieutenant Colonel Greene for his counsel, professional advice, and 
unwavering integrity.

While assigned to the Office of Congressional Legislative Liaison, 
Lieutenant Colonel Greene prepared members of the Army staff for over 
20 hearings and orchestrated over 150 congressional engagements to 
ensure Congress understood the Army programs and budget requirements to 
grow and transform the Army. Lieutenant Colonel Greene escorted over 50 
congressional delegations worldwide.

His expertise concerning congressional affairs, his strategic, 
operational, and tactical knowledge of the Army, combined with his keen 
intuition and ability to develop key relationships have been 
instrumental in enabling the chief of legislative liaison and the Army 
to meet the Army's legislative objectives. Lieutenant Colonel Greene 
has escorted 12 delegations to Iraq and Afghanistan, in support of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. I was 
privileged to have Lieutenant Colonel Greene as an escort on several of 
my own trips.

A tireless worker, he coordinated with all of the relevant agencies 
and individuals to ensure my overseas travel was always successful. I 
am extremely grateful for the service he provided me and my staff 
during those trips.

During his distinguished Army career, Lieutenant Colonel Greene has 
been awarded numerous accolades, including the Defense Meritorious 
Medal, four Meritorious Service Medals, five Army Accommodation Medals, 
two Army Achievement Medals, the Expert Infantry Badge, the Ranger Tab, 
and Parachutist and Air Assault Badge.



Lieutenant Colonel Greene's faithful service, leadership, loyalty, 
and dedication to duty uphold the highest traditions of military 
service, and he has repeatedly stood for the defense of this Nation. 
His devotion to the defense of liberty epitomizes the words soldier, 
patriot and American.

I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Lieutenant Colonel 
Craig M. Greene for his service to our Nation and the U.S. Army. I 
thank his wife, Michelle, and his sons, Jackson and Austin, for their 
support while he fulfilled this essential duty to our country. I 
personally wish the Greene family all the best as they celebrate 
Lieutenant Colonel Greene's richly deserved retirement.
