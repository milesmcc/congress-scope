Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and 
sacrifice of Senior Airman Daniel Johnson. Daniel was killed by an 
improvised explosive device last month in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was 
just 23 years old.

Daniel spent much of his childhood in Minnesota and Wisconsin before 
moving to Schiller Park, Illinois to live with his grandmother. Family 
members remember fondly Daniel's lifelong dream to fight for his 
country and the pride he felt when he put on his uniform. In 
Afghanistan he disarmed dangerous bombs, continuously risking his life 
to protect others.

His commitment to service extended beyond the battlefield. Daniel 
attended Triton College with the admirable goal of one day working as 
an emergency medical technician. Today, I offer my deepest condolences 
to all of those who had the privilege to know such a selfless and 
giving young man.

I join with them in mourning the loss of this brave airman and 
exemplary American. On behalf of the United States Congress and the 5th 
district of Illinois I thank him for his courage. To his family, 
friends, and loved ones: Daniel's country will never forget his 
service.
