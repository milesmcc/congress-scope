Mr. INHOFE. First of all, before I get into what I want to talk 
about, I have been listening to the Senator from Utah. I find it to be 
very interesting because his subject matter is also a mission of mine. 
I think a lot of people have not realized the problem we have with the 
bum raps given to Guantanamo Bay, and almost all of them are by people 
who have not been there. To my knowledge, almost without exception, 
those people who have gone down there--newspapers and publications 
making accusations of torture and human rights violations--once they go 
there and see it, you never hear from them again, and that includes Al-
Jazeera and some of the Middle Eastern publications. I believe we have 
a problem with people who have somehow brought forth this idea that 
there have been abuses that haven't taken place. I think probably the 
most important part of the argument is that there is not another 
Guantanamo Bay; there is no place you can put these detainees.

As I said in my question to the Senator from Utah, what are we going 
to do with these some 245 detainees if they are not there? Also, with 
the escalation of activity in Afghanistan, what will we do with those 
detainees whom we will capture? The problem is, some people say they 
will be put in prisons in Afghanistan. There are two prisons there; 
however, they have said they will only take Afghans. If the terrorist 
who is caught is from Djibouti or Yemen or Saudi Arabia, there is no 
place else to put them other than Guantanamo Bay. It is a resource we 
need to have. We don't have a choice.

I believe our President was responding to a lot of activists who were 
upset because during his inaugural address he didn't say anything about 
this, so they are making demands that he stop any kind of legal 
activity that is going on in the way of trials or tribunals and then 
close it in 12 months. You cannot do that until you determine how you 
are going to take care of the detainees who are currently there and 
those who will be there.

I feel strongly we are going to have to look out after the interests 
of the United States. Nothing could be worse than to take 15 to 17 
installations within the continental United States and put terrorists 
there, only to serve as magnets for terrorist activity.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning 
business for as much time as I may consume.
