Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, while I applaud the fact that H. Con. Res. 152 
recognizes and reinforces a two-state solution to end the conflict 
between Israel and the Palestinians, I urge Congress and the 
Administration to move away from rhetoric and actively engage in steps 
that will foster lasting peace in the Middle East. The Israeli-
Palestinian conflict not only grossly disrupts the lives of Israelis 
and Palestinians, it destabilizes the entire Middle East and enflames 
extremism, threatening U.S. national security.

U.S. involvement in Iraq has consumed the Administration's attention, 
but resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict is an integral component 
for long-term peace in the region. Efforts to bring resolution to this 
conflict should not be put on the back burner because of the 
Administration's political fumbling in Iraq. I urge the Administration 
to reinvigorate its role as a fair and balanced broker and call on the 
U.S. Congress to recognize that securing peace in the volatile Middle 
East will require a sustained financial commitment. And, I urge our 
friends and allies in the region to recognize that peace in the Middle 
East is in their own countries' best national security interests and to 
become more actively engaged in the peace process.
