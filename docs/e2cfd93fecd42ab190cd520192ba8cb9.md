Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No, I'm sorry.

Here's the response. The minority had the right to offer this in a 
way in which we could debate it. They didn't choose to do that. They 
chose to do it in this limited fashion.

So it does look to me like you are having problems here that does the 
Government of Iraq have business interests with Iran. I know there are 
close ties between the Governments of Iraq and Iran. There's 
interchangeability.

I think this is a pretty sketchy way to go forward. I'm not sure that 
there are any other countries. I think Iraq may be one of the few that 
doesn't. It's fairly narrowly drawn, but that's of great concern. And I 
couldn't get a direct answer, and I don't know if anybody really knows 
it.
