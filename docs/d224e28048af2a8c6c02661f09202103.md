Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I only want to ask the author of the 
amendment, because I'm not sure I heard him correctly. Did he suggest 
that he thinks that the Iraqis have read this amendment?

I'm not entirely sure you would agree that all of our colleagues have 
read this amendment. But do you really think the Iraqis have read this 
amendment?
