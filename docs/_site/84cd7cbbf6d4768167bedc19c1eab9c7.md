Mr. KYL. In response to the Senator from Oklahoma, that is the point 
I raised at the very end. It is not only a question of whether the 
President's new strategy has a chance to succeed, as he believes it 
does, but what is the alternative. If the alternative is leaving Iraq a 
failed state, I have barely scratched the surface of identifying the 
horrors that that would represent and the dangers to American national 
security that it would involve. We need to do a better job of 
articulating that alternative. As I see it, that is the only 
alternative that has been put forward to the President's new strategy.
