Ms. FOXX. My colleague, Representative Akin, has made very eloquent 
remarks on this bill. I will submit my comments for the Record, but I 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6208.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill designating 
the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1100 Town 
and Country Commons in Chesterfield, MO, as the ''Lance Corporal 
Matthew P. Pathenos Post Office Building.''

Marine LCpl Matthew P. Pathenos was more than a selfless patriot. He 
was a loving son, brother, and friend.

As one of his comrades in arms reflected, ''The best thing about Matt 
was his ability to wake up every day with a smile and hold it all day 
long.'' Even in the hardships of war, Matt strove to bring joy to his 
friends.

A native of Ballwin, MO, Matt was an avid golfer and accomplished 
pilot, earning his license at the age of 14. After graduating high 
school in 2003, Matt followed in the footsteps of his older brother and 
mentor, Marine Sgt Christopher Pathenos who enlisted in the wake of 
September 11.

In the words of one relative, ''For Matty, the motivation was more 
about Christopher, seeing how the Corps treated him.''

A member of the 3rd Battalion, 24th Marines, Matthew was one of 80 
members of his unit that attached to a sister unit, the 1st Battalion, 
24th Marines, for deployment to Iraq in September of 2006.

Tragically, on February 6, 2007, Lance Corporal Pathenos lost his 
life near Fallujah when his Humvee was stuck by an improvised explosive 
device.

His family will always remember him as the smiling young man who 
''sang as though no one could hear him and danced as though no one was 
watching him.''

In a release shortly after his tragic loss, the family captured the 
sentiments of a grateful nation. ''Like his brother, Christopher, 
Matthew was proud to be a Marine and volunteered to serve his country. 
Matthew paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom and the future 
generations of this country. He loved his country and family, and we 
will miss him terribly.''

I urge my colleagues to support this bill honoring a courageous young 
man that embodied the deepest ideals of this great Nation. He lost his 
life in defense of freedom and this sacrifice shall not be forgotten.

I yield back the balance of my time.
