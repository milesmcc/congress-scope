`Mr. SMITH of Nebraska â€” 28 March 2007`

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay 
tribute to Army SGT Wayne Cornell, a Nebraska native who lost his life 
last week. Cornell and another soldier were killed when a roadside bomb 
exploded near their vehicle in Baghdad. They were soldiers with the 1st 
Battalion, 28th Infantry, 4th Brigade, 1st Infantry Division.

Wayne was on his first tour of duty in Iraq, and during 4 years with 
the Nebraska Army National Guard, had served twice in Bosnia and once 
in Afghanistan.

According to his family, Wayne was a strong man--both physically and 
emotionally. He was a black belt in taekwondo and a loving husband and 
father.

My thoughts and prayers go out to Wayne's wife, Patricia, who is 
expecting their third child this July. It is heartbreaking that a man 
who is often described as someone who ''lived for his wife and kids,'' 
will not be able to see his children grow and succeed in his footsteps.

We all owe Sergeant Cornell a debt of gratitude we can never repay. 
His courage, love of family, and strength should set the benchmark for 
us all.
