Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of this bill because it 
would change our strategy in Iraq towards the successful outcome, while 
ensuring that America will be more secure. It


does so by providing, most importantly, a date certain by which we will 
not be in Iraq, approximately 9 months from its enactment, that serves 
as the sole remaining leverage we have to change the structure of 
incentives in that country and in the region toward stability.

Presently, the Iraqi ministries are personal fiefdoms where the 
leaders pursue their personal ambitions while we provide them political 
and military cover in what is now principally a civil war.

Political reconciliation. How? When their very top Shia and Kurdish 
leaders recently told Senator Hagel and me that the re-Baathification 
law is only appeasement to the Sunnis. But our U.S. leaders in Iraq say 
it is critical to success and stabilization.

A date certain finally forces the Iraqis to make the difficult 
political compromises they are presently avoiding; more importantly, it 
changes the incentives and therefore the behavior of Iran and Syria 
from being involved destructively in this war because we are bleeding 
towards working for stability.

As our top political leader in Iraq said, Iran does not want a failed 
state if we depart.
