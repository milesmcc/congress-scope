`Mr. LEVIN â€” 28 September 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. There has been no one in this Chamber who has worked 
harder to try to bring enough Senators together to pass a resolution 
calling for a change of course in Iraq than Senator Salazar. He has 
been absolutely intrepid. There is not a day that goes by when he is 
not working with colleagues looking for a path forward where we can 
accomplish a change in course, where we could not only begin the 
transition to a new mission--which is out of a civil war, out of the 
middle of this sectarian conflict--but also where there is, at a 
minimum, a goal set for the completion of that transition to those more 
limited ambitions which would be supportive of Iraq, supportive of 
their army, but part of a change of policy which would force the Iraqis 
to finally take responsibility for their own country.

I just want to commend the Senator for his insistence. He has a 
theme, and it is the correct theme, which is that a bipartisan solution 
and resolution is absolutely critical in foreign policy, and 
particularly in war. There is no partisan position in war which is 
right for the Nation. It is always in the middle of a security 
conflict--as we are in the middle of now--where there has to be a 
bipartisan approach. The Senator from Colorado has pled for it, called 
for it, worked for it, and has asserted his vast energy to try to 
achieve it.

We haven't accomplished it--it being 60 votes. The rules of the 
Senate are that it takes 60 votes to adopt something like this, and the 
Iraq resolutions are operating under that rule, so we need to get the 
60. It is not because of a lack of effort on the part of many of us, 
but surely Senator Salazar is at the head of that list. The Senator 
from Colorado has put forth such Herculean efforts to get to that mass 
of 60 who could agree on a formula that could represent those goals--to 
begin the reduction of our troops and the transition to the new 
missions, which are not in the middle of sectarian conflict but 
supportive missions--and to have a binding period under Levin-Reed, and 
then a goal under some permutation of Levin-Reed to accomplish that in 
9 months.

So I wanted to add my thanks to those of the Senator from Virginia, 
who very appropriately interrupted the Senator from Colorado, and I 
join in that interruption to thank him and to agree that the Senator 
from Virginia has been very much a part of an effort in this Senate to 
move this process forward over the last few years. And I want to also 
add my thanks to those of the Senator from Colorado of my dear friend 
from Virginia because he has played an important role to the extent 
that we have been able to move this process forward. He has been in the 
middle of that movement.

It is not nearly enough from my perspective. We have obviously tried 
to get to Levin-Reed, which would change the course in Iraq, and we 
haven't done that yet. But we are going to keep plugging away because 
it is critically important that we succeed in Iraq and that we 
recognize that the only way we are going to succeed is if the Iraqi 
Government works out the political differences among them because there 
is


no military solution. And the only hope of success is if the Iraqi 
leaders finally do what they promised to do a year ago, which is to 
work out their political differences.

If I could take one more minute of the Senator's time, there is a 
book out recently about President Bush. I am trying to remember the 
name of the author, who had great access to the President. In this 
book, in the appendix, there is a reference to the fact that I had 
previously told the President that I and many others had taken the 
message to the Iraqi leaders that they have to change, they have to 
work out their political differences; that the American people's 
patience has run out. The President was asked to refer to that and also 
to the debate on the Senate floor.

What was his reaction to these efforts to change course in Iraq and 
to tell the Iraqi leaders that it is their responsibility?

The President's response is interesting. He said, accurately, that 
when I told him this report, that a number of us go to Iraq repeatedly 
and tell the Iraqi leaders: You have lost the support of the American 
people. You guys better get your political act together because, folks, 
we are going to begin to reduce troops here. We can't save you from 
yourself--what was the President's response when I told him of that? He 
said:




 Thank you, Senator. Thank you for carrying that message to 


 the Iraqi troops. They've got to hear that.


It was a positive response--not just to the message which many of us 
have carried, including the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from 
Colorado, and a dozen other Senators--but he thanked me and others for 
telling the Iraqi leaders what he, I think it is clear, would like to 
tell them himself.
