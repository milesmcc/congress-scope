Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the sponsors of this 
legislation. This was an important discussion on the floor.

And I might just conclude in my thanks to the ranking member and the 
chairman of the full committee, and remind my colleagues that the 
message of this legislation is the point of individuals in conflict 
willing to lay their guns and weapons down in what has been a long-
standing civil war, and their ability to share power; important lessons 
for countries or nations like Iraq, Lebanon, and many, many others.

With that, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
