# DEMOCRATIC SUPPLEMENTAL IS DANGEROUS

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the supplemental bill is 
dangerous for our troops and dangerous for America.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates restated yesterday to the bipartisan 
Army Caucus that timetables will stop the military from completing its 
mission. The Washington Post has criticized the proposal, saying it 
could lead to massive civilian casualties, to al Qaeda establishing 
bases to attack America and our allies, and to a regional war of 
disastrous consequences.

Al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri has identified Iraq and Afghanistan as 
the central fronts in the global war on terrorism. Bin Laden has 
specifically referred to Iraq as the ''Third World War.''

As a 31-year veteran with four sons in the military, including one 
Iraq veteran, I understand the importance of supporting our troops in 
combat. I hope my colleagues of both parties will join me to support 
former Vietnam POW Sam Johnson's bill to fully support and fund our men 
and women in uniform.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11
