`Mr. ALTMIRE â€” 9 May 2007`

---


Mr. ALTMIRE. I appreciate the gentleman from Connecticut, and I 
admire his leadership. I know that you did make that trip to Iraq and 
you came back and you can speak with some authority and some expertise, 
and I appreciate hearing from you. And I especially appreciate the 
opportunity to speak tonight on what is definitely the most important 
issue I think everyone would agree that we face.

I was struck by the fact that the gentleman mentioned third-party 
verification for different options and different opinions in Iraq. And 
what strikes me is the fact that the President of the United States has 
declined to listen to any third-party verification. He has delivered a 
loud and clear message last November that the American people called 
for change, not only domestically here in America but especially in 
Iraq. He has been told by his generals on the ground that he is not 
moving in the correct direction. He has been told by his advisers, 
before they're replaced, that he's not going in


the right way. The Iraq Study Group, as we all know, recommended the 
course of action that we have advocated; and the bill that he vetoed 
was verified by the Iraq Study Group.

The fact that he fails to listen to the American people, he fails to 
listen to his military advisers, he fails to listen to his White House 
advisers and he fails to listen to the Iraq Study Group, that 
demonstrates a clear decision on his part that he is going to ignore 
all of those opinions and continue down the same failed course.

I was dismayed today when I heard the news that 35,000 American 
troops have been told that they can expect to be sent to Iraq this fall 
and that their tour is going to last at least through the spring of 
2008. Now, this is additional troops after the surge that we had been 
told in January was only going to last a few months and only going to 
be 21,000 troops. Now we're hearing an additional 35,000 troops and the 
surge is going to be at least 18 months instead of the 2 or 3 or 4 
months that were we were initially led to believe.

But, thankfully, this Congress took clear and decisive action by 
sending the President a bill, which we have talked about before, that 
gives the troops the money that they need. It actually contains more 
money in funding for our troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan 
than the President requested, and that bill was met with a veto, as we 
know.

I had someone come up to me over the weekend and say, well, when are 
you going to get our troops the money that they need? And I said, we 
sent the President a bill that does exactly that. It was the 
President's decision to veto that bill and delay this process and, most 
importantly, delay the funding for our troops.

So the fact that he now came out and made a statement today that if 
we sent him a bill, that is, we took out all the things that he talked 
about that he doesn't like, it is not going to have the timelines and 
the things that he used as his reason for vetoing it the first time, we 
are going to send him a bill that gives the troops the funding that 
they need to get them through the next several months, and it is 
actually going to again be more funding than he asked for for the 
period of time that we are going to send him the money for, and we were 
told today that is going to be met with a veto.


So I am exasperated to hear this, because I want the troops to get 
the money and the funding and all the equipment and resources that they 
need to continue the brave fight that Mr. Murphy from Connecticut was 
talking about and that he witnessed firsthand. But we can't do that 
alone. We need the President to sign the bill that we sent him.

Tomorrow, we are going to vote on our second bill after the veto; and 
we are going to send it to the White House. I hope that the President 
will reconsider his decision to delay the funding that our troops in 
the field need, because these are the bravest and brightest Americans. 
These are people who are putting their lives on the line. They are 
giving every sacrifice. They are leaving their families back home for 
extended periods of time, multiple tours. And we are giving them the 
money that is required, but the President is delaying the process. So I 
share the frustrations of the gentleman from Connecticut.

At this time, I will yield to the gentlewoman from Florida, our 
fearless leader with the 30-Something Working Group, Ms. Wasserman 
Schultz.
