Ms. LEE. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the McGovern-
Sestak-Bishop, GA, amendment.

This important amendment will restore public access to the name, 
country of origin, and other information of graduates and instructors 
of the infamous Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, 
WHINSEC, formerly known as the School of the Americas.

In doing so, this amendment will provide a critical measure of 
transparency to the training provided by the United States at this 
institution.

We know that prior training provided by WHINSEC has led to increased 
instability in Latin America and numerous violations of human rights at 
the hands of former students--including torture, extortion, and 
executions.

Rather than supporting peace and stability, this institution has 
instead done quite the opposite.

Many countries in the region are still struggling to recover from 
decades of dictatorship, corruption, and human rights abuses 
perpetrated by WHINSEC graduates.

At a time when our occupation of Iraq has greatly damaged our 
credibility and standing in the world, it is imperative that we reverse 
the legacy of this school that is drenched in secrecy, terror, and 
violence.

I urge my colleagues to improve our reputation as a promoter of 
democratic ideals, protect human rights, and support this amendment.
