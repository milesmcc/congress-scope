Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is so right, and I appreciated the way the 
subcommittee thoroughly looked at the administration's budget request, 
scrubbed the numbers, and listened to what our senior defense leaders 
had to say. The 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the Vermont 
National Guard--the only Army brigade in the Army with a ''Mountain'' 
fighting designation, comprised of upwards of 1,800 proud citizen-
soldiers from Vermont--will begin a yearlong deployment to Afghanistan 
next year. They will help train the Afghan National Army, which is 
critical to our success there. We want all our deployed forces--from 
Vermont, Hawaii, and every State, and every armed service--to have the 
best protection from roadside bomb attacks. That need is reflected in 
the urgent request from Central Command, in the so-called Joint Urgent 
Operational Needs Statement.
