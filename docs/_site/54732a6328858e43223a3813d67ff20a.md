Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, another day, but yet not other dollar has been 
sent by Congress to supply our warriors in Iraq with the equipment and 
resources they need.

The troops will soon be out of money to carry on the war in Iraq. 
Congress needs to get needed funds to our military.

Our troops are the best ever assembled for warfare. They are all 
volunteers. They will do their duty in spite of congressional inaction 
for money.

Our troops are relentless. They adhere to the words of Winston 
Churchill in 1941. ''There shall be no halting or half measures. We 
cannot for a minute afford to relax. On the contrary, we must drive 
ourselves forward with unrelenting zeal.''

So Congress must appropriate money to make that military mission 
successful. And what is that mission? -

In part, it is what President John F. Kennedy said years ago: ''Let 
every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we will pay 
any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, 
oppose any foe, to assure the survival and success of liberty.''

And that's just the way it is.
