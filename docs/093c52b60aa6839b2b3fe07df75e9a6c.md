`Mr. BUNNING â€” 11 September 2007`

---


Mr. BUNNING. You will notice on this vote that not one Senator--not 
one--voted against General Petraeus. During the debate on his 
confirmation, no one questioned his integrity or ability to complete 
his mission--a mission the Senate gave him by confirming him. And now, 
nearly 9 months later, how do we greet him when he comes back to 
deliver a progress report on Iraq that we requested, the Democrats, 
also, in Congress requested? Instead of thanking him for his sacrifices 
and listening to him deliver his report, many Democrats who voted to 
confirm him are either attacking his personal character or not 
defending him from a personal smear attack by their allies at 
MoveOn.org. I cannot believe this slanderous campaign started before 
they even heard one word of General Petraeus's report.

I read a quote from an anonymous Democratic Senator in the Politico 
newspaper this morning. I want to share it with this body today. This 
Democrat, who did not want to give his or her name, made the following 
statement:




 No one wants to call [Petraeus] a liar on national 


 [television]. The expectation is that the outside groups will 


 do this for us.


I do not even know where to begin to describe my disgust with that 
one. It shows that the attack on General Petraeus is a coordinated 
attack by MoveOn and its allies.

Here is just some of what my Democratic colleagues have been saying:




 I don't think General Petraeus has an independent view.


Here is another one:




 At the end of the day, these are not totally independent 


 free agents. They are an appendage of the administration.


And another:




 The fact that there are questions about General Petraeus' 


 report is not surprising. . . . By the general's admission, 


 the so-called surge has not achieved its goal. . . .


Wrong. I cannot believe these false statements have been made on the


floor of this Senate. It is outrageous to condemn a unanimously 
confirmed general and question his patriotism for this country simply 
for political sake.

I know many of my friends on the other side of the aisle are good, 
decent people. But I have to say, I am amazed that more of them have 
not denounced this kind of smear campaign.

The folks from MoveOn accuse General Petraeus of ''cooking the 
books.'' Is this because his counterinsurgency operation and the surge 
in Iraq are seemingly having positive results? Democrats are talking 
out of both sides of their mouths, and it is time for them to stop 
talking and start listening. Instead of taking political advice from 
leftwing activist groups, Democrats should actually take time to listen 
to General Petraeus's report.

I cannot tell you how disgusted I was to see the full-page ad 
yesterday in the New York Times--which cost $167,000; that is what it 
cost--questioning the character of a four-star general who only 9 
months ago had the support of this entire body.

These tactics are insulting and should be condemned. In my book, the 
people who resort to this type of below-the-belt mudslinging are no 
patriots.

I happen to know General Petraeus. He is a good friend of mine and a 
good friend of the Commonwealth of Kentucky from his days as the 
commanding officer of the 101st Airborne Division. He is a brave 
patriot of the highest moral character and has made immeasurable 
sacrifices for our country. He has spent the last 4 years deployed from 
his home, from his family and his loved ones, overseas serving this 
great Nation. Three of these years he has spent in Iraq, where he has 
worked tirelessly to build security and stability throughout the 
country. His efforts are seeing positive results.

To suggest he is driven more by politics than by his love of our 
country may possibly be the lowest political attack I have ever seen in 
my time in the Congress. In the 4 years I have known him, not once did 
General Petraeus bring up politics--not once. I have no idea what he 
is--whether he is a Democrat or a Republican. In all of our 
discussions, including the hour I spent with him alone in my office 
before he left for Iraq to implement the surge, I do not believe the 
word ''Democrat'' or ''Republican'' was ever used. What I do know is he 
is a great patriot. He does not deserve to come home to be greeted by 
personal political attacks, especially by the very Democrats who asked 
him to come home and give us this report 9 months ago.

Let me be clear to my Democratic colleagues: Using leftwing attack 
groups such as MoveOn to discredit General Petraeus--these are the 
worst of the worst. Any politician willing to sacrifice the long-term 
security of the United States in an attempt to salvage a short-term 
political career is beyond deplorable. I will not stand for it. Our 
military will not stand for it. And the American public will not stand 
for it.

Just yesterday, a poll by the same New York Times reported that 68 
percent of Americans trust the military commanders more than the 
Democratic Congress when it comes to Iraq policy. The American public 
supports our military. It is time for Congress to echo this support.

Yesterday, in my office, I had the opportunity to sit down one on one 
with a young, brave Kentuckian who had just returned from a long 
deployment in one of Iraq's hotspots. At the end of our visit, he 
turned to me and made one request. He asked for Congress to support the 
troops.

How can we expect General Petraeus and our troops to successfully 
complete their mission when we keep attacking them and threatening to 
cut off their funds? I promised this young man my support and will 
continue to do all I can to support our troops.

As we find ourselves 6 years from this tragic event, this terrorist 
event that occurred on September 11, 2001, we must not forget there are 
those out there who still want to harm us. The freedoms we enjoy daily 
are protected by the brave men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, 
including General Petraeus and the young man with whom I visited in my 
office yesterday.

To all of those who suggest General Petraeus should be called 
''General Betray Us,'' I have a message for you: You are the ones 
betraying our troops and the American people. You are giving aid and 
comfort to our enemies. We used to try people who did this as traitors.

Just 5 months ago, the Senate Democratic majority leader was quoted 
as saying:




 No one wants us to succeed in Iraq more than Democrats.


Well, I say to my friend, the majority leader, stand by your words. 
Let's focus on succeeding in Iraq and for once show a united support 
for our troops.

Every night, my wife Mary and I take about 10 minutes at 9 p.m. and 
say prayers for our troops and pray for the safety and security of our 
Nation. I suggest to all who are listening and who are in this body to 
do likewise. Maybe Democrats should take a moment of silence and stop 
criticizing our commanders and troops.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by 
the two leaders today, the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of 
the Cornyn resolution, the text of which is the exact language of the 
amendment which Senator Cornyn offered this morning. Further, I ask 
consent that if the resolution is agreed to, the preamble be agreed to 
and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
