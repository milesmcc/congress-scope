Mr. DURBIN. I just have one question for the Senator from New 
Hampshire. As I understand it, the President is going to ask for $196 
billion for 1 more year in the war in Iraq, not paid for.

So would the Senator be voting against the President's request for 
$196 billion, unpaid for, to continue the war in Iraq?
