`Mr. REID â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished chair of the 
Judiciary Committee, I don't have to go home. People call me. I talk to 
my brothers. They tell me what they think is wrong. I talk to my 
friends. I have tried every weekend when I have some time and I am 
here--I try to reach some people in Nevada I haven't talked to in a 
while. They say exactly what my friend from Vermont says: Get us out of 
there. Get us out of there.

That is what this Levin-Reed amendment is all about, to change course 
in Iraq. The American people deserve that.
