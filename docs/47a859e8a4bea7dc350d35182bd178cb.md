`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 7 March 2007`

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I sit on the Government Oversight and 
Reform Committee, and in that committee, we found out that we sent $9 
billion in cash over to Iraq, on pallets, handed it out in duffel bags. 
We found out that when we were subcontracting to these subcontractors 
to do security, they subcontracted again, and they subcontracted again, 
and everybody takes a little money off the top every time. We did not 
know. We had not heard about any of that until we started doing 
hearings.

So you are exactly right. Hammer that point home. This is not doing 
hearings for hearings sake. This is doing hearings to uncover the 
waste, fraud and abuse that has been happening in this government. This 
is my taxpayer dollars. This is my neighbor's taxpayer dollars that are 
going down the drain with some of these programs. This is real stuff.
