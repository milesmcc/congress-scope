Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I want to remind my good 
friends that yesterday we were on the floor of the House and my good 
friends on the other side of the aisle, the Republican minority, 
blocked the passage of this emergency relief to so many Americans. And 
I rose yesterday and I asked the question, Who will be a Good Samaritan 
and stand with those who are in need?

Right now, soldiers on the front lines of Iraq and Afghanistan have 
family members who are unemployed and who have exhausted their 
benefits. What do we say to them? In Texas, we have a total of 160,000 
Texans who have now either exhausted or will exhaust their unemployment 
benefits. They do so in an economy where they've lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own.

That's why we put this bill on the floor of the House because you 
could have gone to a job, worked for a week, and the business closed 
down because of varying economic crises created by this administration.

We've lost--324,000 jobs have disappeared over this period of time, 5 
consecutive months. We've lost 300,000-plus job. And the unemployment 
rose to the highest in the month of May.
