# MAKING EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS MOTION TO PROCEED
## `d5a984549cd9a01dda55715079bbc5e8`
`Mr. REID â€” 15 November 2007`

Mr. REID. Yes. We will do a unanimous consent request in a minute for 
your approval or disapproval. What we are going to do is come in in the 
morning. I want to come in early because of requests from both your 
side and my side that we vote first on an Iraq matter that the minority 
has brought to the floor; then we would vote on a motion to proceed to 
the bridge bill that the House voted on last night; and then we would 
vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the farm bill. At that time, 
hopefully, we would be ready to wind things down until after 
Thanksgiving.
