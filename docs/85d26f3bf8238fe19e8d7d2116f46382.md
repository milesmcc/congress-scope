Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of 
this bill. And in particular, I want to sincerely and deeply thank 
Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh on behalf of all New Yorkers and 
this Nation for providing the leadership to include for the first time 
much-needed money for the health care needs of the heroes and heroines 
of 9/11.

These rescue, recovery and cleanup workers selflessly rushed into the 
flames of 9/11 to save the lives of others. We lost 3,000 people on 9/
11, but many thousands more lost their health. This bill includes $50 
million for their treatment. This is the first time it has been part of 
an appropriations bill, and I deeply thank Chairman Obey for working so 
hard to make this happen. In the past it has been tacked onto emergency 
spending and to the Iraq spending bill, but it is the least we can do 
to provide health care to these men and women.

Very importantly, the bill includes detailed language requiring the 
administration to develop and submit a long-term comprehensive plan to 
address these critical health needs. This is a tremendous step forward. 
I thank Chairman Obey.
