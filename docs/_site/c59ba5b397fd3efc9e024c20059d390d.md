# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mr. GOODE â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. GOODE. Madam Speaker, it is an honor to receive time from someone 
who served our Nation in the finest way and who knows firsthand how 
hurtful a resolution such as this can be to those in theater.

We are in the middle of a 4-day marathon here. While I cannot say 
that I agree with all of the actions of the President in dealing with 
Iraq, I will not be supporting H. Con. Res. 63. The eyes of the world 
are upon this House, and there will be commentary from the Middle East 
to the streets of small-town America about what we do here over this 4-
day period, even though this resolution does not carry the weight of 
law.

When the commentary begins in the Middle East, in no way do I want to 
comfort and encourage the radical Muslims who want to destroy our 
country and who want to wipe the so-called infidels like myself and 
many of you from the face of the Earth. In no way do I want to aid and 
assist the Islamic jihadists who want the green flag of the crescent 
and star to wave over the Capitol of the United States and over the 
White House of this country. I fear that radical Muslims who want to 
control the Middle East and ultimately the world would love to see ''In 
God We Trust'' stricken from our money and replaced with ''In Mohammed 
We Trust.''

I am not sure that reinforcing the existing troops by 20,000 will 
save us from the jihadists, and I am not sure it will prevent chaos in 
Iraq. I do hope that these additional forces will stabilize Baghdad and 
will lead to democracy and a tolerance of divergent views and religions 
in Iraq. Unfortunately, the history of that region does not bode well 
for such conclusions.

In my view, the United States by removing Saddam Hussein has provided 
a great opportunity for Iraq to be a showcase for tolerance and 
understanding. Perhaps one day Iraq may want to adopt something like 
the first amendment of our country. That may only be an optimistic 
hope.

I hope my fears and the fears of others about chaos and calamity 
prove false. If the Shiite and Sunni controversy escalates and the 
situation worsens, we could be faced with a clamor to admit thousands 
and perhaps millions into this country. I call on the President and our 
Secretary of State to not allow a mass immigration into this country 
with the dangers and pitfalls that it could bring to our safety and 
security. The terrorists would surely enter into this country in such a 
way as the 9/11 terrorists swam around in a sea of illegal immigration 
before we were struck on September 11.

Let us vote ''no'' and let us forestall, if not prevent, calamity.
