Ms. HOOLEY. I thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding.

Madam Speaker, this vote today is about what kind of a country are 
we. This vote today is about what our priorities are. This vote today 
is about what our values are. Just the interest rate on funds to pay 
for the Iraq war are $25 billion a year; yet our President believes 
that spending $12 billion a year on children's health care is too much. 
I strongly reject the argument that we are spending too much on our 
children. Our children deserve better. Our children deserve a healthy 
start.

I have heard over and over from my constituents about the vital 
importance of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Nearly 
60,000 children in Oregon currently receive health care through SCHIP, 
and the legislation before the House today will provide for an 
additional 36,000 children. I know hardworking parents who can't afford 
health insurance for their children. They don't know what to do. How am 
I going to cover my kids?

Thankfully, today, we are taking strong action to ensure that 
thousands of fewer working families in Oregon will have to endure the 
agony of having a sick child for whom they cannot afford medical care.

I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.
