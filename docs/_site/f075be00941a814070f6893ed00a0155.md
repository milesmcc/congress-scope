`Mr. DAVIS of Illinois â€” 9 October 2007`

---


Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H.R. 
3530, which names a postal facility in Inverness, Florida, after Chief 
Warrant Officer Aaron Weaver.

H.R. 3530, which was introduced by Representative Ginny Brown-Waite 
on September 14, 2007, was reported from the Oversight and Government 
Reform Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has 
the support of the entire Florida congressional delegation.

Madam Speaker, Chief Warrant Officer Aaron A. Weaver was killed on 
January 8, 2004, while on board a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter when it 
crashed during a Medevac mission in Fallujah, Iraq. He was assigned to 
C Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division in 
Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Chief Warrant Officer Weaver's job in Iraq was to fly observation 
helicopters, monitor the enemy and send the information he gathered 
back to headquarters. He was on a Black Hawk helicopter en route to 
Baghdad for a checkup when the craft was shot down by enemy fire. Eight 
soldiers besides Chief Warrant Officer Weaver were killed. Chief 
Warrant Officer Weaver survived the October 1993 battle of Mogadishu in 
Somalia, but did not survive his tour in Iraq. He was a committed 
soldier and leader who served his country with honor and distinction.

Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Ginny Brown-
Waite, for introducing this legislation and urge its passage.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
