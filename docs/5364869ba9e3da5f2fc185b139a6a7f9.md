Mr. TOWNS. I now yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform, I am pleased to present H.R. 3386 for consideration. This 
legislation will designate the United States postal facility located at 
1165 2nd Avenue in Des Moines, Iowa, as the ''Iraq and Afghanistan 
Veterans Memorial Post Office.''

At this time I would like to reserve the balance of my time.
