`Mr. HOYER â€” 10 June 2010`

Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I have not discussed specifically what actions Mr. Obey--Mr. Obey is 
looking at the supplemental. It was sent over to us. And he's 
discussing it with the various subcommittee chairs, I know. I don't 
know whether he's discussed it with Mr. Lewis at this point in time. 
But I do know that, as you know, he had a markup scheduled on our 
supplemental the week before we left. That was canceled, so it didn't 
go forward; and then the Senate passed its bill.

But I would certainly hope that your side has input on what they 
want, what you want, what you think ought to be in there. Obviously, we 
want to respond to some of the crisis not only offshore in Iraq--well, 
this is mainly Afghanistan and Pakistan as the gentleman knows, but my 
belief is Mr. Obey will want to have input as well.

So I can't give you specifically because Mr. Obey has not indicated 
to me at this point in time what his specific plans are. But I 
understand the gentleman's interest.
