Mr. FILNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for allowing me to 
take a few minutes on this amendment. As we are very much concerned 
with our Iraqi and Afghanistan young men and women who are returning 
with grave injuries, we cannot forget our older veterans and the 
justices that we have to make up for.

We can go back to World War II where we have atomic veterans who have 
not yet received compensation for being in testing areas without being 
told. We have merchant mariners who never got benefits of our GI Bill, 
who are in their eighties and we need to say thank you to.

We have a group of veterans who were drafted into the Army in 1941, 
all the Filipinos who were in the Filipino army and various units and 
various irregular areas defending that territory. That was a territory 
of ours. And we drafted all the soldiers into our Army with the promise 
that they would have benefits later.

Those Filipino soldiers, over a quarter million of them, held up the 
Japanese advance for weeks and weeks and weeks beyond their scheduled 
advance. It allowed us back home to prepare better and for MacArthur to 
return. And though the Japanese overran the Philippines in the terrible 
battles of Corregidor and the famous death march of Bataan, the 
surviving soldiers were able to harass the Japanese through guerilla 
work, and they were not strong enough to resist MacArthur when he 
returned. In fact, it was the Filipinos, bravely alongside their 
American counterparts, who helped to win the war in the Pacific.

After the war was over, after we had won in both the Atlantic and 
Pacific, the Philippines were granted their independence, and the 
Congress of 1946 said, You got your independence. You take care of your 
veterans. Yes, you saved America, but that is your problem, not ours 
anymore.



Although President Truman signed the legislation which embodied that 
in law, he said, We must repair this important travesty. We promised 
those veterans full benefits. We have taken them away. We have to go 
and give them back. That was 62 years ago, Mr. Chairman, and that 
travesty still burns in the hearts of the Filipinos who are alive, and 
their family members.

The amendment I have in front of the body says that, basically, We 
are sorry, but thank you.



It provides a pension for those brave Filipino veterans. This is a 
moral necessity for America to close the chapter on World War II. This 
is a moral necessity for this Congress to make up for a mistake that 
was made 62 years ago.

I know many Members of this body agree with remedying this moral 
disaster, and yet we have had problems of how we pay for that and how 
we somehow use the budget to make sure that we are helping these 
deserving veterans, while not taking away from our brave young men and 
women from either World War II, Vietnam, Korea, the Persian Gulf war 1 
or the present conflicts.

So, Mr. Chairman, I am trying to figure out a way to do that. I know 
the vast majority of this body agrees with me, and I look forward to 
working with you to find a way to do that.

I know there are other speakers on this amendment. I would hope that 
we have a colloquy with the chairman on his time in a few minutes.

I yield back the balance of my time.
