Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I think that the President was right 
yesterday when he called our friends on the other side of the aisle out 
of touch.

In my hometown of Amsterdam, New York, there are neighbors who are 
hurting. In some instances, this recession has eliminated nearly half 
of their retirement savings. Others have lost their homes.

Despite this downturn and Wall Street's recklessness, Republicans 
still want to privatize Social Security. They want to create a casino 
economy and play Russian roulette with our hard-earned retirement 
savings.

Most of the seniors in Amsterdam have worked hard and have played by 
the rules their entire lives. Social Security, which they have paid 
into their entire working life, is their crucial safety net and 
financial security. Let's not gamble it away to appease Republicans, 
Wall Street, and big banks.

Just a few days ago, the leader of the other side suggested slashing 
Social Security benefits and using those funds and savings to pay for 
the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. Enough is enough.

Democrats in Congress are standing up for seniors and fighting to 
protect Social Security, to create jobs here at home and to support 
small business as the engine of job growth.

Mr. Speaker, I will continue to fight for seniors because they are 
deserving of the respect that they have earned.
