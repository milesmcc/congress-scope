Mr. ANDREWS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding time.

I rise in strong support of this legislation. The slogan that we 
should support our troops is given life and reality by this bill, by 
paying them well, by equipping them well, and by supporting them in 
every respect. This bill deserves the support of each and every Member 
of this body.

I also echo the remarks of my friend from New Jersey with respect to 
the


hard work that has been done to be sure that Americans who have been 
victimized by the state-sponsored terrorism have adequate means of 
redress in our courts. This is the issue that gave rise to the 
Presidential veto. I happen to agree that the compromise in front of us 
makes imminent sense.

The general rule in American law is that when you sue someone, you 
don't have the right to freeze their assets or go after their assets 
unless you win a judgment. We make an exception to that general rule in 
the case of assets owned by states which are involved in state-
sponsored terrorism. It is the wisdom of the compromise here that that 
provision remains in effect for all of the other states that are 
involved in state-sponsored terrorism, with the exception of Iraq, 
which was under the regime of Saddam Hussein. It leaves to the 
discretion of the President a waiver to determine whether claims 
against that regime under Saddam Hussein should go forward, and how 
they should go forward.

This is an issue that I think the Congress ought to reconsider and 
revisit in 2008 and beyond. I, frankly, believe that an American who 
has been the victim of improper or illegal conduct under the old regime 
should not go without legal redress. That is a lingering question that 
is as a result of this compromise, but it's a wise and necessary 
compromise that would permit us to do what we should have done a long 
time ago for the men and women who serve this country so well.

So I congratulate the chairman and Ranking Member Hunter as authors 
of the compromise. I appreciate their hard work in bringing this bill 
back to life. Happily, I will support it, and look forward to doing 
even greater things in 2008.
