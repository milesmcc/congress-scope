Mr. RYAN of Ohio. On behalf of the American people, I think they are 
trying to see what we are trying to do. We are trying to end this war, 
stop the killing of our own kids, stop the maiming of our own soldiers, 
get them out of a civil war, try to calm down what's happening, stop 
the $8-plus billion a month that we are spending over there, and try to 
take some of that money and invest that into our own students, our own 
kids.

I was, just before I got here, having dinner with an old friend of 
mine, who is a Republican. He said, we have spent $400 billion, soon to 
be $500-and-some-billion dollars on this war. Can you just imagine, we 
could have covered all of our citizens for health care, we could have 
paid for everyone's college education, and, you know, gotten some stuff 
done in this country.

Instead, we have $500 billion, we have well over 3,000 kids have 
gotten killed, adults and soldiers, some 25,000 maimed or injured and 
God knows how many innocent Iraqi civilians, many of them children.
