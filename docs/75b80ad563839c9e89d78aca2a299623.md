Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, 4 years ago, the President declared: 
''Mission Accomplished.'' I would ask the President, Madam Speaker, 
whose mission was accomplished by the invasion and occupation of Iraq? 
Was Halliburton's mission accomplished? Was the oil companies' mission 
accomplished? Was the defense contractors' mission accomplished?

I was at Arlington Cemetery this morning where so many of our brave 
young men and women responded to the call of duty. Their mission was to 
put their lives on the line for America. They accomplished their 
mission. This Congress has not accomplished its mission.

We must stop funding the war. We must end the occupation. We must use 
the money in the pipeline to bring our troops home. We must reach out 
to the nations of the region to create an international peacekeeping 
and security force to stabilize Iraq. And we must bring to justice 
under our Constitution and under the laws of this Nation those in high 
office who took us into a war based on lies. Then we will have 
accomplished our mission. Then we will have restored America's honor, 
America's greatness.
