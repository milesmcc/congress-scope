`Mr. BRALEY of Iowa â€” 23 July 2007`

---


Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. 
Con. Res. 175, which helps children of fallen soldiers access military 
death benefits. I would like to express my deep appreciation to my 
friend, Congressman Latham, for taking the lead on this issue. I am 
proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation.

On June 5th, 2006, Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Jaime Jaenke was 
killed in Iraq when her Humvee was hit by a roadside bomb. Ms. Jaenke, 
from Iowa Falls, was the first female from Iowa to die in the Iraq 
conflict.

Jaenke left behind a daughter, Kayla, who is cared for by Jaenke's 
parents. She had designated her mother, Susan, as the beneficiary of a 
$100,000 death benefit intended to help survivors. However, under law, 
only spouses or children are allowed to receive the benefit, so it must 
be kept in a trust for Kayla until she turns 18.

But the Jaenkes need the money now. They incurred unanticipated 
expenses such as hiring a lawyer to get legal guardianship and 
obtaining health insurance for Kayla. They also had funeral costs and 
other expenses, even as their horse stable was losing money.

Congressman Latham's resolution would express the sense of Congress 
that courts should have the discretion to redistribute death benefits 
to caretakers if the service member left clear intent for the use of 
these funds. This would be a Godsend to the Jaenkes and the at least 
143 identical cases where other families are affected by these same 
circumstances.

Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to act, and they need to act fast, to 
help the families of those who have given so much for their countries. 
These families already have to face the anguish of losing a son or a 
daughter. They should not have to worry about the financial strain of 
dealing with unexpected expenses. I urge all of my colleagues to send a 
strong message to our military families that we understand the need for 
flexibility in protecting these families from unintended consequences.
