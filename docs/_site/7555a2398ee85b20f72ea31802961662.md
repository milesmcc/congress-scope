Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Reclaiming my time, we only get 5 
minutes. You know, if the minority had wanted to put this forward as an 
amendment, we could have debated it. They did it this way. So we can 
debate all of the other things. It's a very straightforward question.

You limit eligibility under this program. Iraq might very well owe us 
money. The question isn't nuclear weapons. It is, would this prevent 
Iraq from being eligible, these criteria. And I would hope someone 
would answer that.

I will yield again for an answer.
