Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was impressed with what the Senator from 
Ohio said, and I commend him for what he said. We talk about the cost 
of the President's war in Iraq and we have been in Iraq longer than we 
were in World War II and the cost just in interest of the huge deficits 
and the tripling of the national debt under the Bush-Cheney 
administration; if we take the money we pay on interest on the national 
debt and the money we pay in Iraq, it comes to somewhere around $1 
billion a day, every single day of the year.

Think what we could do with that $365 billion a year: health care for 
everybody, dramatically improve our schools, research on Alzheimer's, 
diabetes, AIDS, cancer, so many things. Instead, we are sending 
interest payments overseas and money to Iraq.

So I commend the Senator from Ohio for speaking out as he did.
