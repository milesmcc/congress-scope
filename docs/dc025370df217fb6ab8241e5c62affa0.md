Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, tonight the American people will 
hear the truth about the fiscal situation that President Obama 
inherited.

There won't be any sugarcoating in the form of accounting gimmicks 
that hide the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, natural disasters and some 
Medicare payments. President Obama believes that government should be 
honest, and he is doing the right thing by eliminating accounting 
gimmicks. Such tricks gave the false impression that the government was 
actually addressing our Nation's fiscal mess when it really wasn't.

Mr. Speaker, tonight President Obama will level with the American 
people about the $1.3 trillion deficit that he inherited from President 
Bush. In the days ahead, we will work with President Obama to make the 
hard choices necessary to put us back on a fiscally responsible path.
