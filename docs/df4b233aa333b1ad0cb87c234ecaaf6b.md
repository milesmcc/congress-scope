Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on 9/11, 2001, two planes flew 
into the World Trade Center and killed over 3,000 Americans, the worst 
attack on America in the history of this country, worse than Pearl 
Harbor. The people who are behind it were al Qaeda, and Osama bin Laden 
said numerous times he wanted to destroy America. They are the mortal 
enemy of the United States of America.

General Petraeus today, when he talked to the Members of Congress, 
said numerous times that they were fighting al Qaeda, al Qaeda, al 
Qaeda in Iraq, the mortal enemy of the United States of America.

Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to pull us out 
of there. And if they do succeed, then I believe that that will become 
a gathering point for all of the al Qaeda operatives and other fellow 
travelers in the world, and they will try to attack the United States 
in numerous ways, probably on our home soil again. They attacked the 
USS Cole, our embassies in Africa, they attacked housing in Saudi 
Arabia.

I just want to say to my colleagues, remember what you are doing. If 
you force us out of Iraq now, you are helping al Qaeda. You are helping 
al Qaeda set up a base of operation, and they will be able to attack 
the United States of America again.
