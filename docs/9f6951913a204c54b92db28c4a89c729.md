Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of one 
of the Senate's giants, Robert C. Byrd. My family and I were saddened 
to learn of his passing on Monday morning at the age of 92. I will 
remember Senator Byrd as a fierce defender of the Constitution, master 
of Senate procedure and a proud fighter for West Virginia and its rural 
heritage. Senator Byrd was more than just a colleague, he was a mentor. 
He taught me--and everyone who had the honor of serving with him--never 
to apologize for standing up for your State.

During more than a half century of service in Congress, Senator Byrd 
gave a voice to those who would not have been heard otherwise. There 
are times when it is easy to get caught up in the petty bickering and 
partisan squabbles that seem to be increasingly plaguing this chamber. 
But, we would all do well to follow the example Senator Byrd set for 
all of us during his legendary Senate career and never lose sight of 
the fact that we are sent here to fight for those in our home States 
and across the country who cannot fight for themselves.

Senator Byrd's work on behalf of his constituents is well known. West 
Virginians knew they could count on their senior Senator to come here 
to Washington and deliver for them. They were not alone. I will never 
forget how helpful Senator Byrd was to my State. Louisiana lost a true 
friend. Through storms and floods, Senator Byrd made sure that promises 
made to the gulf coast, particularly to Louisiana, were not broken. He 
kept an eye on the fair and just distribution of funds to Gulf Coast 
States, and I and everyone I represent will always be grateful for his 
dedication to our recovery.

One critical example is his effort to provide funding for Louisiana's 
Road Home program. Road Home, which is the largest single housing 
recovery program in U.S. history, was designed to provide compensation 
to Louisiana homeowners whose houses were destroyed by Hurricane 
Katrina or Rita. In late 2007, as Louisiana faced a daunting program 
shortfall, it was Senator Byrd who stepped up to help me secure $3 
billion to keep this rebuilding program going.

A year later, Senator Byrd once again stood up for the people of 
Louisiana, when he worked with me to include $8.7 billion for gulf 
coast hurricane recovery and protection in the emergency supplemental 
spending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan. The funding provided for 
levees, criminal justice needs, health care and housing for low-income 
hurricane survivors.

Senator Byrd once said, ''The people of Louisiana have the strength 
and the spirit to rebuild their homes and their communities. We owe 
them the support to get the job done.'' He did not just pay lipservice 
to the gulf coast. He delivered for us time and again, because he 
understood the importance of standing up for those who were hit so hard 
by the tragic storms that battered the Louisiana coast.

Senator Byrd was not just a colleague who put his weight behind 
fighting for the gulf coast region. He was also a walking encyclopedia 
of Senate history, and he was always willing to impart his vast 
knowledge to anyone who wanted to learn about the legends that walked 
these halls for more than two centuries before us.

When I was first sworn in as a U.S. Senator, back in 1997, my entire 
family came to Washington for the event. After it was over, I asked 
Senator Byrd if he would give my family--both adults and children--a 
history lesson on the Senate. He graciously obliged, and for 2 full 
hours spoke eloquently and expertly on the history of this great body. 
His lecture left a lasting impression on every single member of the 
Landrieu family, and it is a memory we will always cherish.

Senator Byrd spoke with such passion about John C. Calhoun, Henry 
Clay, Daniel Webster, Rebecca Felton, Everett Dirksen and the many 
other historical figures who shaped the Senate. It is only appropriate 
that he will forever be mentioned in the same breath with these men and 
women he so truly admired. And, it makes me proud to have had the 
opportunity to serve with a man who left such an indelible mark on this 
Chamber.

As we reflect on Senator Byrd's remarkable life and career, our 
prayers are with the Byrd family. But we all take comfort in knowing 
that while he leaves behind one of his great loves--the Senate--he is 
finally going home to be with his greatest love--Erma.
