Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 6983, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction 
Equity Act. It is long past time that the 54 million Americans 
suffering from mental illness have access to the care they need, and we 
cannot afford another day to go by.

This legislation is named in tribute to the late Minnesota Senator 
Paul Wellstone whose work on this issue was groundbreaking. I also rise 
to thank my colleague from Minnesota, Congressman Jim Ramstad, for his 
courage in sharing his experience with substance abuse and his hard 
work on this legislation. Without his dedication and perseverance, we 
would not be at this critical moment.

We have all been affected in some way--ourselves, a family member, a 
friend, or colleague--by mental health or substance abuse. This is an 
issue I hear about in my district a lot and I thank my constituents who 
have been willing to share their stories to make change.

The current system is unfair and inadequate. People should not have 
to forego essential treatment because of cost when care could mean 
improvements to their quality of life and productivity. Parents should 
not end


up with an emergency room bill they cannot pay because they rushed 
their child to the hospital after a suicide attempt. Our service men 
and women returning from Iraq should not be handed a 1-800 number to 
treat a mental illness.

Passing this bill is both morally and economically right because 
delay not only affects individuals and families, but it also affects 
schools, businesses, and our communities. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting for this important bill. Today we can finally make mental 
health parity a reality.
