Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H. Res. 519, Expressing appreciation to the people and Government of 
Canada for their long history of friendship and cooperation and 
congratulating Canada as it celebrates Canada Day. I'm proud to be an 
original cosponsor of this resolution, and I'd like to thank my good 
friend Bart Stupak for offering it.

On July 1st, 1867 with the enactment of the British North America 
Act, Canada was united as a single country. Over the next 142 years, 
Canada has become one of our closest friends, our largest trading 
partner and a steadfast ally.

And in the wake of 9/11, Canada has been a stalwart partner, sending 
troops to Afghanistan as part of the NATO coalition. They have stood 
shoulder to shoulder with us as we conduct our difficult mission to rid 
Afghanistan of the Taliban and give the Afghanis hope for a life free 
from tyranny and repression.

Our Canadian friends have been vital as we work to secure the 
homeland on our shared waterways and long land borders. Cooperation is 
the key to securing the homeland along the Northern Border, and I'm 
pleased to say that we have a great partner in Canada.

In southeast Michigan, cross-border communities symbolize the 
relationship we share with our Canadian neighbors. Detroit, Michigan 
and Windsor, Ontario jointly celebrate Canada Day and the United 
States' Independence Day with the International River Days.

This festival lasts several weeks, culminating in one of the largest 
and most spectacular fireworks displays in North America.

I want to wish our neighbors and friends in Canada a happy and 
prosperous Canada Day.

I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
