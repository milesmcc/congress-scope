Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.

Every Member of this body has an obligation to do their best to share 
their beliefs in what they think we face with the American people and 
their constituents. I believe that this problem in Iraq that we've got 
to do better with is not the end of this at all.

For some reason, God spared us again with the JFK plot and allowed us 
to actually interdict that before another September 11 or even worse 
happened. For some reason, He granted us grace, but it is a matter of 
time, given the conflicts that we face.

To the people, this Iraq conflict is a chapter in the war that is 
mounted against us, and it's not the end, anymore than the first 
bombing in 1993 of the World Trade Center was the end. We denied that 
it happened, but we weren't willing to address it, and September 11 
happened. But Iraq is no different in the long-term conflict which is a 
generational struggle with radical Islam.
