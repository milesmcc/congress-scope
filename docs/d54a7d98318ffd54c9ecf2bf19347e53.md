Mr. MURTHA. One of the Members said, how many less Iraqis have been 
killed? I don't know how many less Iraqis we killed. I know 62 
individual American soldiers or marines have been killed this last 
month.

I want to say about equipment, I have got a chart here with the Army 
National Guard. Every single National Guard unit in this Nation, all 50 
States, doesn't have the Humvees they need.

Every State, they don't have the 7-ton trucks they need. Every State, 
they don't have other equipment, the equipment they need for jammers 
and so forth.

When you say they are training on equipment and are not fully 
trained, they don't have the equipment to train on. This bill provides 
that. When you vote against this bill, you are voting against the extra 
money to fix that problem.
