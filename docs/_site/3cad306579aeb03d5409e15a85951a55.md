`Mr. KERRY â€” 15 May 2007`

Mr. KERRY. I have no objection to that. I propound that request: 2 
hours of debate initially equally divided and a subsequent half hour 
equally divided, and with the first 10 minutes to be taken by the 
Senator counted against him to speak on Iraq. Then I add, if I may, 
that no second-degree amendment be in order prior to the vote and, upon 
the use or yielding back of time but not before 5:35 p.m, the Senate 
would then proceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that the 
amendment by agreement must receive 60 affirmative votes to be agreed 
to; if it does not it would be withdrawn without further intervening 
action or debate.
