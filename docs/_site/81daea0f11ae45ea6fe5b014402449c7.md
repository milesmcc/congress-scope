`Mr. YARMUTH â€” 5 December 2007`

Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, how many times is President Bush going to 
hold the same press conference, hammering away at Congress just because 
we're meeting our responsibilities under article I and restoring 
Americans' faith in the future? Doesn't he understand that the American 
people chose to put Democrats in control of Congress for a reason?

All year long we have been working to take our Nation in a new 
direction and restore that faith in the future. In some instances, the 
President has joined our efforts. We worked together to fully implement 
the 9/11 Commission recommendations, increase the minimum wage, and 
make college more affordable for millions of college students. 
Unfortunately, in almost every other instance, President Bush has stood 
in the way of real progress. He refused to help us provide quality 
health coverage for 10 million children. He rejected our efforts 
consistently to change course in Iraq. And he has threatened to veto 
our appropriations bills that truly prioritize our domestic needs.

Madam Speaker, President Bush has every right to be frustrated by his 
lack of accomplishments, but he has nobody to blame but himself. He 
needs to stop standing in the way of progress.
