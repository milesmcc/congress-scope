Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join 
me in support of H.R. 1853, the Jose Medina Veterans Affairs Police 
Training Act.

Mr. Speaker, more than 1.5 million U.S. troops have served in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, and according to an Army study, 20 percent are showing 
signs of post-traumatic stress syndrome. But surprisingly, most VA 
police officers do not receive any training on how to deal with 
patients suffering from mental illness. That is why we must prepare VA 
law enforcement officers to deal with the tens of thousands of veterans 
returning from Iraq that are expected to utilize VA medical centers for 
mental health services.

H.R. 1853, the Jose Medina Veterans Affairs Police Training Act, will 
ensure that our veterans are treated with dignity and respect when they 
seek treatment at VA facilities. Veterans' mental health needs should 
be one of this Congress' top priorities, and I urge your support.
