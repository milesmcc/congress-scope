Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor St. John's United 
Church of Christ in Breese, Illinois. For 150 years, St. John's has 
been one of its community's cornerstones. Before a frame church was 
built in the summer of 1858, services were held in the homes of 
settlers and led by the people themselves. In 1859, the Rev. 
Christepler Starck was called as the first resident pastor. A parsonage 
was built in 1861 and the church's membership continued to grow.

Throughout its 150-year history, St. John's UCC in Breese, Illinois 
has served both its local community and the world. St. John's works 
with House of Manna, a local food pantry, and runs a vacation bible 
school for local children. St. John's members prepare meals for local 
seniors and send care packages to servicemen and women in Iraq. As an 
active contributor to the wider outreach of the United Church of 
Christ, St. John's gives to meritorious national and international 
organizations.

St. John's also embodies the spirit of neighborliness: with its 
active involvement in yearly ecumenical services; in its close working 
relationship with a local catholic church; and when it gives freely of 
space and time to local community organizations.

I join with my fellow Representatives to congratulate St. John's on 
150 years of faith, service, and neighborliness.
