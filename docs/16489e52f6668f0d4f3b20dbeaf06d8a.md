Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 30 years of 
exemplary service that Colonel Frazier of the United States Marine 
Corps has given to this great country.

Colonel Frazier has served in many capacities since he enlisted in 
the U.S. Marine Corps in 1974. During his seven years of enlisted 
service and 30 total years of service, he served a myriad of posts in a 
variety of locations worldwide. He has served his country both in 
enlisted service and in positions of leadership in Saigon, Korea, 
Okinawa, Thailand, Russia, Camp Pendleton, CA; Parris Island, SC; 
Australia, Quantico, VA; Stuttgart, Germany; and finally, in Iraq.

In 1989, he earned his BS in Criminal Justice Administration from 
National University using the Marine Corps College Degree Program. Upon 
graduation from Top Level School in 2003 he was assigned to I Marine 
Expeditionary Force G-4 Division and completed two deployments to Iraq. 
He was promoted to Colonel on 1 January 2005 and joined MCIWEST 
Headquarters in March 2006 and served concurrently as Head, 
Infrastructure Plans Branch and as Assistant Chief of Staff Facilities, 
MCB, Camp Pendleton, CA.

With such a diverse resume and a multidisciplinary record of 
leadership positions, his deep understanding of many facets of the 
United States Marine Corps lends him to being not only just an 
excellent advocate for our troops, but a quintessential example for how 
diversely talented a Marine can be. With his willingness to travel, to 
continue his education and to serve his country wherever and whenever 
possible, the United States and the U.S. Marine Corps could not have 
asked for more. In his 30 years of military service Colonel Frazier has 
proven himself an able and willing leader.

His personal decorations include the Bronze Star, three Meritorious 
Service Medals, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, three 
Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and two Good Conduct Medals.

Colonel Frazier is married to the former Myra Marie Marbrey of 
Carlsbad, CA. They have five children: Gerald, an Air Force Master 
Sergeant, Clyde III, Jeremy, Michael and Anthony.

On behalf of the people of the United States, whom Colonel Frazier 
spent a career serving, I thank him for his service and commitment to 
the defense of our Nation; he truly is a great American hero.
