Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might add, on our most recent trip 
visiting Iraq, you went out of your way--as a matter of fact, I joined 
you--in not only meeting with representatives of these Christian 
minorities who had been persecuted through the years, but then we 
included a trip into Jordan, where we also made some assessment of the 
refugee situation over there. I think some credit goes to our chairman 
for his personal initiatives.
