`Mr. REID â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, late this morning, I sent a letter to the 
distinguished minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell. I addressed the 
letter ''Dear Mitch,'' and I will read the letter.




 There are no more solemn decisions facing Members of 


 Congress than the conduct of the war and the placing of our 


 troops in harm's way. As you know, more than 3,600 brave 


 Americans have lost their lives and more than $400 billion 


 has been expended on the war in Iraq, which has now moved 


 into its fifth year, with no end in sight. Yet Senate 


 Republicans have chosen to prevent an honest debate, an 


 action on legislation to provide an Iraq strategy that will 


 allow us to responsibly redeploy our troops and refocus our 


 attention on the very real threat posed by al-Qaida. This is 


 partisan obstruction that I fear will make us less, not more, 


 secure, and I urge you to reconsider your course.



 Today's headlines confirm the importance of allowing the 


 Senate to consider amendments to change the course in Iraq 


 and refocus our resources so we can more effectively wage the 


 war on terror. The news reports indicate that the violence in 


 northern Iraq has escalated at the same time the Director of 


 National Intelligence released a new assessment that al-Qaida 


 has regenerated key elements of its homeland capability. As 


 long as our troops are mired in policing an Iraq civil war, 


 they cannot focus on the enemy that attacked us nearly 6 


 years ago, an enemy that, regrettably, has regenerated its 


 attack capacity since 9/11.



 Furthermore, contrary to your previous assertions, there is 


 a long, bipartisan tradition of allowing Senators to offer 


 defense-related amendments on the Defense authorization bill 


 without the obstruction Senate Republicans are employing 


 today. The record also clearly shows that both Senate 


 Democrats and Republicans have recently foregone the 


 opportunity to block action on important Iraq-related 


 amendments.



 For example, just last year the Senate voted up or down on 


 two Iraq-related amendments on the Defense authorization 


 bill. Additionally, Senate Democrats did not place a 60-vote 


 hurdle in front of Republican amendments to strike Iraq 


 policy language in the Iraq supplemental spending bill, nor 


 did votes on final passage of the Iraq supplemental require 


 60 votes.



 Therefore, I renew the proposal I offered to you recently 


 to permit the Senate to act on a series of amendments 


 pertaining to Iraq. Under my proposal, the Senate would hold 


 up-or-down votes on the bipartisan amendments offered by 


 Senators Levin and Reed, Lugar and Warner, Salazar and 


 Alexander, and Nelson and Collins. There are other amendments 


 Republican and Democratic Senators wish to offer related to 


 Iraq, and I would be willing to work with you to ensure these 


 amendments also receive up-or-down votes.



 For the sake of our troops and the American people, I hope 


 you reconsider your decision to obstruct Senate action on 


 critical amendments that would change the course of the war 


 in Iraq.


We have completed a vote, yet another example of an Iraq-related 
amendment with a majority vote. We didn't demand a 60-vote margin on 
Cornyn. It is another example of how amendments should be handled; that 
is, with a simple majority vote.

The American people deserve up-or-down votes, yes or no: Vote on the 
amendment. The Levin-Reed amendment is a bipartisan amendment. For me, 
one of the most significant paragraphs in that legislation was authored 
by Senator Hagel of Nebraska. It basically says we need to have the 
United Nations involved in this intractable civil war. It is a 
wonderfully written paragraph that strengthens this bipartisan 
amendment.

We have three Republican cosponsors of this amendment.

A vote on this bipartisan amendment will be a vote to change course. 
A ''no'' vote would be a vote to stay the course, to continue the 
President's failed strategy indefinitely.

President Bush's term of office is winding down. We should not have 
to wait until he completes his term of office before we change course 
on this war in Iraq. A ''yes'' vote on this bipartisan amendment would 
finally bind President Bush to responsibly reduce combat operations and 
return our focus on the real and growing threats we face. That is why 
I, once again, request unanimous consent to move to an up-or-down vote 
on Levin-Reed, along with the amendments my Republican colleagues wish 
to offer and other Democrats who wish to offer amendments.

I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2088 be withdrawn and at 
6:30 p.m. today the Senate vote on the Levin-Reed amendment, No. 2087, 
with the time between now and then equally divided in the usual form, 
with no second-degree amendments in order.
