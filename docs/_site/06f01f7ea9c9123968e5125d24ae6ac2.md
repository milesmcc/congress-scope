Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his observation. But, of course, 
my assertion was not 1776 to 2000; it was 2003 and 2004.

But the point that I will make, and if I can conclude, Mr. Chairman, 
I appreciate the time. The point that I wanted to make, though, is 
irrespective of that assertion one way or the other, I believe every 
one of our colleagues, whatever their view on this resolution might be, 
all 435 have every intention and will in fact do whatever they need to 
protect and promote the safety of our men and women in harm's way. And 
the assertion, I tell my friend, that was made by the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico that the verbiage of this resolution says, because serving, 
it does not mean those who will serve, obviously, as soon as they are 
sent into theater, they are serving in Iraq and they are covered by 
this resolution. There ought to be no confusion on that issue by 
anybody on the floor or anybody who might be listening to this debate.
