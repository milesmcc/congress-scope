Mrs. MALONEY. Madam Chair, it is time to repeal the ''Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell, Don't Pursue'' policy and to allow lesbian, gay and 
bisexual persons to serve openly in the military.

From the initial introduction of this profoundly misguided policy in 
1993, I have never wavered in my belief that our nation's armed forces 
should not discriminate against otherwise qualified citizens on the 
basis of their sexual orientation. Today, at a time when our nation is 
engaged militarily in both Iraq and Afghanistan, the extent to which 
the so-called compromise ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy has damaged 
America's military readiness has become even more apparent than it was 
seventeen years ago.

The policy against allowing lesbian, gay, and bisexual service 
members to serve openly has resulted in depriving our armed forces of 
the abilities, experience and dedication of thousands of qualified 
active duty personnel. This institutionalized discrimination is 
completely illogical and counter-productive as we grapple with an 
increasingly dangerous world, with our servicemembers serving all over 
the world

The U.S. Government Accountability Office, GAO, has documented the 
cost to our nation. In 2005, the GAO estimated the cost of 
discriminating against service members on the basis of their sexual 
orientation at nearly $200 million over the course of just the last 
decade. This estimate may, in fact, be too low, as the GAO itself 
acknowledged and as other studies conducted by reputable academic 
institutions like the Michael Palm Center at the University of 
California have documented.

Advocates for the ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy continue 
stubbornly to cite elusive factors to justify its inherent 
institutionalized discrimination. The most common argument is the 
specious insistence that ''unit cohesion'' among the armed forces will 
suffer if lesbians, gay men, and bisexual persons are allowed to serve 
openly--an argument that even Richard Cheney, while serving as the 
Secretary of Defense during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, 
acknowledged in congressional testimony was ''a bit of an old chestnut 
to be tossed onto an open fire and consigned forever to the ashbin of 
history.''

The fact is that many other nations--including trusted allies whose 
armed forces are respected around the world such as Great Britain, 
Israel, Australia, and Canada--have allowed their citizens to serve in 
their armed forces regardless of their disclosure of their sexual 
orientation. It is high time that the United States of America, which 
prides itself as a beacon of liberty and equality, joins their ranks.

I urge the members of this House to vote to repeal this misguided and 
counterproductive and un-American policy.
