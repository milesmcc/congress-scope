Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to say 
a few words about an amendment I have offered, No. 2905, that is 
cosponsored by Senators Sununu, Kerry, Harkin, and Brown. This 
amendment addresses a problem that is huge, that is going to continue 
to grow in coming years, and is something the Congress must address. 
All across our country, veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan are 
going to come home with what we believe to be very high levels of post-
traumatic stress disorder as well as traumatic brain injury. These are 
the signature injuries of the war in Iraq. I worry very much that we 
are not yet prepared to address this serious problem which not only 
impacts the returning soldiers, it impacts their wives, their kids, and 
their communities.

The amendment I have offered would develop a pilot program for State-
based outreach to assist servicemembers and their families. The concern 
I have is that those who return home with TBI or PTSD are not going to 
get the care they need unless somebody makes contact with them and 
makes them aware of services and help that might be available. We can 
have all of the money we want allocated to addressing TBI or PTSD, but 
unless somebody goes out and brings those people into the system, that 
money is not going to do any good. I worry about that, especially for 
those returning soldiers who are in the National Guard who are not part 
of the active duty, who do not have a military infrastructure in front 
of them. I worry about soldiers coming home to small towns in Vermont 
and all across this country who suddenly find that their world is very 
different than the world they left, that they have nightmares, cold 
sweats, panic attacks when they go through a tunnel, and they don't 
know how to address those very serious symptoms of post-traumatic 
stress disorder.

What this amendment does uniquely is create an outreach effort by 
which trained personnel from the National Guard or elsewhere are 
literally going to knock on doors and chat with the individual 
returning soldier and his or her family and get a sense of what is 
going on in the family, letting those veterans understand that what 
they are experiencing is something being experienced by tens of 
thousands of other soldiers, and there is nothing to be ashamed of 
about the kinds of problems that individual is having.

The essence of this program is its nature as an outreach effort, not 
to sit back but to aggressively go out, knock on doors, have dialog, 
and bring people into the system which might be able to help them.

This amendment is supported by the National Guard Association of the 
United States. They have pointed out that this amendment, with its 
unique emphasis on outreach, is a perfect compliment to the 
reintegration and readjustment policies laid out by the Yellow Ribbon 
Program in the previously adopted Chambliss amendment to the Defense 
authorization bill.

This is a very strong amendment. I look forward to having support on 
both sides of the aisle. If we are serious about addressing the 
problems of PTSD and TBI, we have to be aggressive in outreach. That is 
what this amendment does.

I yield the floor.
