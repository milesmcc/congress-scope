`Mr. WAMP â€” 18 June 2007`

---


Mr. WAMP. Colonel, it is an honor to join you tonight and my 
colleagues on the floor. Anytime I have the privilege to stand and 
honor our men and women in uniform, I try to begin with what John 
Stuart Mill said about war. He said, ''War is an ugly thing, but not 
the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and 
patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. 
The person who has nothing for which they are willing to fight, nothing 
which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable 
creature and who has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by 
the exertions of better men than himself.''

Those better persons that Stuart Mill referred to are the people we 
rise tonight to honor, the men and women in uniform of our Armed 
Forces.

They understand from time to time it is necessary for people to put 
themselves between a threat and our civilian population, and they know 
that freedom, every time it has been extended from one generation to 
the next, it has been by those people who have been willing to put 
themselves and their lives, everything they have, their whole measure, 
between the threat and our civilian population.

Tonight, Colonel, I come to the floor to talk briefly about this 
threat because, unfortunately, the conversation revolves around one 
theater in this war and that is Iraq. We know mistakes have been made. 
We know it has not gone as well as we would have liked. Wars are that 
way. Stuart Mill said it is an ugly thing.

I don't know of a war that has been perfectly executed. I know that 
the march to Baghdad was perfectly executed, but I know that 
intentionally the insurgents have wreaked havoc wherever they could, 
from bombing the Samarra mosque which initiated the last 16 months of 
internal strife within Iraq, by design, knowing that that would test 
our will to see if we were a ''paper tiger'' or if we were the strong 
and determined United States of America.

I think a lot of people forget who it is that threatens freedom-
loving people all around the world. They are called the jihadists, the 
Islamists, the radicals within Islam. The problem here is this is not 
just a religious issue, it is a political agenda. The call is for a 
Shariah, global Islamic rule. That's the truth. Read. I would encourage 
people to read ''Hatred's Kingdom.'' Read ''America Alone.'' Read 
''Looming Towers.'' Read ''While Europe Slept.''


Read ''Londonistan.'' Read ''Epicenter.'' Read ''Knowing the Enemy.'' 
You will understand the history of how we got where we are.

One slice, the Wahhabi movement, the most radical out of the Saudi 
Arabia Sunni sect. A man named Sayyid Qutb came to the United States 
about the time I was born in the late 1950s, was educated at Northern 
Colorado State University, and went back and began to indoctrinate the 
Wahhabi sect that western liberalism, self-determination, freedom, 
would create apostasy and ungodliness and it must be stopped.

One of his lieutenants was Osama bin Laden. One of the people that he 
taught at university was Osama bin Laden. These things didn't happen by 
accident. For years this has been brewing. It is a real threat.

Unfortunately, the left has a propaganda campaign in this country to 
cause people to believe this is all just Iraq, if we would just leave 
Iraq, if we had never gone we wouldn't have a problem, or that life 
would just return to normal or that everything would just be okay. It 
is just simply not the case. We were not in Iraq before September 11. 
We weren't in Iraq before 1993. They hit us over 40 times since 1979. 
You have to study the history of it all.

When the Wahhabis took Mecca in the late seventies, the Saudi Arabia 
Kingdom made a deal with them that they would start spending money in 
this country.
