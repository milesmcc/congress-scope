Mr. ROSS. H. Res. 97, providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost 
accountability, and it is quite simple. We want this administration to 
be accountable for your tax money, Mr. Speaker, that is being spent in 
Iraq, number one.

Number two, we want a Truman-like commission to put an end to war 
profiteering in Iraq.

And, finally, we want this administration to stop playing games and 
asking for emergency supplementals to hide the true cost of the war and 
ask for the money the way that all other funds are appropriated by this 
Congress, through the normal process.

One hundred point four billion dollars was the cost for 2006. Over 
$400 billion has been spent since this war began. That is $8.4 billion 
a month. That is $275 million a day, and that is nearly $12 million an 
hour of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, and the tax money of every 
hardworking man and woman in this country; and it is time to restore 
commonsense, fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. 
That is one way, Mr. Speaker, that we believe we can honor our men and 
women in uniform.
