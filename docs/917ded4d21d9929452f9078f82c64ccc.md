Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, today I will vote for the Responsible 
Redeployment from Iraq Act. I agree with the 70 percent of Americans 
who want our troops out of Iraq. And I agree with the comprehensive 
report called ''Strategic Reset'' from the Center for American 
Progress, written by three authors, one of whom is Lawrence Korb, 
former Assistant Secretary of Defense.

They write, ''The current Iraq strategy is exactly what al Qaeda 
wants, the United States distracted and pinned down by Iraq's internal 
conflicts, trapped in a quagmire that has become the perfect rallying 
cry and recruitment tool for al Qaeda. The United States has no good 
options, given the strategic and tactical mistakes made in Iraq since 
2002, but simply staying the course with an indefinite military 
presence is not advancing U.S. interests.''

Today we will vote to change the course to bring our troops home by 
April of 2008. I will proudly vote in favor of that bill.
