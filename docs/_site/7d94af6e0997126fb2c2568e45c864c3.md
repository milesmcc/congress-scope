Ms. LEE of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Also let 
me thank Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha for their hard work on this 
bill and for including provisions that I offered, prohibiting the 
establishment of permanent bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I opposed the 2001 resolution authorizing the use of force because it 
gave President Bush and any future President an open-ended blank check 
to wage war anywhere on the globe, starting in Afghanistan.

Nearly 8 years later, I continue to oppose the supplemental 
appropriations bills for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq because it 
continues us down the wrong path and can lead to war without end. 
Unfortunately this will continue to happen if we don't repeal that 2001 
authorization.

I oppose this $94 billion supplemental because it favors military 
activities over diplomatic, development and reconstruction efforts by a 
ratio of 9-1. Afghanistan will not be stabilized through military 
action.

As noted by the Carnegie Endowment, the presence of foreign troops is 
the most important element driving the resurgence of the Taliban. This 
is counter to our national security interests. This does not include an 
exit plan for Afghanistan. It does not fully fund the redeployment of 
troops out of Afghanistan.
