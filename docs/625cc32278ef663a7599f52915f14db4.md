`Mr. JORDAN of Ohio â€” 1 February 2007`

Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
a brave young soldier, and one of America's fallen heroes, Sergeant 
Jonathan Kingman of Ohio.

Sergeant Kingman was a native of Mansfield, Ohio, and graduated from 
Mapleton High School, where he sang in the school choir, played 
basketball, and was a member of the track team.

Jonathan Kingman died on January 20, 2007, in Iraq, while serving his 
second tour of duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Age 21, he 
is survived by loving family, including his wife, children and parents.

In reading of Jonathan's life and speaking with his family members, 
Madam Speaker, I was touched by the dramatic impact this young man had 
on the lives of so many.

Like others before him, from farms, fields, and small towns across 
our land, Jonathan Kingman stood up and volunteered to serve his 
country.

He fought to promote freedom. He gave his life in defense of his 
family, his community, his state, and his nation.

For this, each and every American owes him and his family a great 
debt of gratitude.

Jonathan will be missed. But the strength of his character, and the 
courage he demonstrated through his service, will live on.
