# LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
## `8467cb98bc8ee3bc653dd2cc4314a7d5`
`Mr. HOYER â€” 7 May 2009`

Mr. HOYER. The markup was just concluded. I have not reviewed the 
Tiahrt amendment, nor have I had discussions with the chairman 
regarding the rule and what amendments would be asked for or what 
amendments would be made in order.

Very frankly, I will tell my friend, it's not the majority that needs 
your help in passing this bill; our troops need your help in passing 
this bill, our country needs your help. And I appreciate your comments 
that you support the President in his efforts in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan.



We are confronted with an extraordinarily difficult situation, 
destabilizing situation, dangerous situation, and this supplemental 
obviously is directed at making sure that our troops have the resources 
they need to pursue the objectives that we and the President have given 
to them. We look forward to having that bill passed with bipartisan 
support.
