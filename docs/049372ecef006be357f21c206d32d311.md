Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, there is not a word in this bill that 
silences a religious voice or a voice of conscience because of the hate 
crimes legislation. What there is in this bill is a very important 
choice that my friend, Mr. Taylor, just talked about a minute ago. A 
few years ago, we discovered to our horror that when vehicles drove 
over roadside bombs, the floors of the vehicles were not capable of 
stopping the explosion from killing the troops inside. That problem has 
manifested itself again in Afghanistan on rugged terrain. This bill 
funds 5,000 vehicles that will protect the lives of the young Americans 
who travel that rough terrain.



The choice is not about House procedure or civil rights arguments. 
The choice is yes or no. For those 5,000 vehicles, for those troops who 
travel that rough terrain, yes or no. The right vote is ''yes.'' The 
way to honor our commitment is ''yes.'' I would urge both Republicans 
and Democrats to vote ''yes.''
