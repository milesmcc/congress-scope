Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Salazar and I asked the 
leadership for 30 minutes this morning to discuss Iraq. I thank the 
leadership for giving us that time.

I ask unanimous consent that the time be allocated in the following 
way: 5 minutes each for, first, Senator Pryor, then Senator Bennett, 
then Senator Casey, then Senator Gregg, then Senator Alexander, and 
finally Senator Salazar. If the Chair would let each Senator know when 
5 minutes has expired, I would appreciate that.
