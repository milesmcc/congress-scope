`Mr. EMANUEL â€” 27 September 2007`

Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Defense Secretary Gates requested 
43 billion more dollars for the war in Iraq, 43 billion more dollars to 
support the President's plan for more of the same. We have spent $400 
billion in 4 years on the war in Iraq.

For 41 days of the cost of the war, 10 million children would get 
health care. For 1 month for the cost of the war, 7/1/2/ million 
children would get health care. For 1 week of the cost of the war, 2/1/
2/ million children would get health care.

While billions have gone unaccounted for in Iraq, and the 
administration has shown no willingness to do what is necessary to 
crack down on the waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq, the President calls 
health care for American children excessive spending.



The President is asking for an open-ended, open-wallet commitment to 
Iraq; and yet he's told America's children, you're on your own.

I want you to think about this: there have been three vetoes in 
President Bush's 7 years; one to redeploy from Iraq, one to permit stem 
cell research, and one to give 10 million children health care; and it 
says it all about the President and his priorities.
