# UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS
## `f28d71b14f5c369bbe2127f2e67ffe28`
`Mr. REID â€” 15 February 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, again, this is an attempt to divert 
attention from the issue before this body; that is, whether there 
should be a surge in Iraq. That is it--an escalation. And this attempt 
by my friend, the Republican leader, to divert attention from this very 
important resolution--we support the troops, we oppose the escalation--
is now going to be obfuscated if, in fact, we agree to this request, 
and therefore we will not.

This body is going to have the opportunity to vote up or down if, in 
fact, we can proceed to the resolution. This body will have an 
opportunity to vote up or down: Do you support the troops? Do you 
support the surge?

I object.
