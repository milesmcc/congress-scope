Mrs. DAHLKEMPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
honor the life of Sergeant David W. Wallace, III, of Sharpsville, 
Pennsylvania. Sergeant Wallace was killed in January 2009 while 
deployed to Afghanistan with the 2nd Combat Engineers Battalion, 2nd 
Marine Division.

This morning, the Sharpsville community gathers to dedicate the 
Sergeant Wallace Memorial Bridge, where Sergeant Wallace used to fish 
on the Shenango River. The bridge is a fitting tribute, and the people 
of Sharpsville do a great service to the memory of Sergeant Wallace and 
his family in its dedication.

Sergeant Wallace was only 25 years old when his life was taken in 
Afghanistan. He leaves behind his wife, Erica; his stepson, Landon; his 
daughter, Brooklyn; and a host of family and friends who dearly miss 
their brave soldier.

Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of 
Sergeant David Wallace and commending the people of Sharpsville for 
honoring his service to our country.

God bless his family, and God bless the troops.
