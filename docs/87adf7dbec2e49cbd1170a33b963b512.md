`Mr. ANDREWS â€” 2 May 2007`

Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, by vetoing this bill, the President refuses 
to sustain the troops that we have sent to Iraq. Every dollar they 
need, every ounce of protection they need, and the health care they 
need when they come home is in this bill that he has vetoed. We refuse 
to sustain a failed, endless policy that takes us nowhere.

The President refuses to acknowledge the reality that we have sent 
our sons and daughters to be referees in a bloody civil war. We 
acknowledge that reality, and we want to stop it.

The President refuses to acknowledge the comments of General 
Petraeus, who says that ending this civil war is a political mission, 
not a military one. We acknowledge that reality, and we provide the 
tools to achieve success in that political mission.

Today the President has refused to acknowledge the will of the 
American people, but we are expressing the will of the American people.

We will vote to override this veto, and the result will obtain. But 
we will never yield, never quit, never back up in this effort to change 
this failing policy and bring our troops home from Iraq.

Vote to override this veto.
