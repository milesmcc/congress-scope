Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, Mr. 
Speaker, the King of Jordan offered a challenge to America and the 
world to allow Palestinian children and Israeli children to live in 
peace, as well as children around the world.

I for one, Mr. Speaker, accept the challenge and cite this government 
and particularly this administration for its slowness and its 
inattentiveness to the crisis and the solution and resolution of a 
roadmap for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

The King was right. In 2002, the Arab states did stand up and offer 
suggestions. Many of them may not have been those that we might have 
agreed with, but it is important, Mr. Speaker, that we now come to the 
table for the crisis is spiraling out of control. People are dying. 
Children are without opportunities. And the Iraq war only fuels the 
fire of dissent and confusion.

It is time now for our soldiers to come home. It is time now for us 
to take leadership in the Palestinian and Israeli crisis. And, yes, it 
is time now for us to treat our soldiers at Walter Reed and elsewhere 
with dignity. I join my colleagues in that fight for soldiers and for 
peace.
