Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, thousands of active duty 
servicemembers are returning home from Afghanistan and Iraq every year, 
many of these individuals serving continuously, having enlisted right 
out of high school or college.

For years, they have lived a structured military life on bases and 
abroad. This structure makes for a well-disciplined and a well-trained 
military force, but it can also make for a difficult transition back to 
civilian life. Many returning servicemembers have no experience with 
saving or budgeting or with credit, taxes, and/or mortgages. As a 
result, many military families are falling into unmanageable debt, 
bankruptcy, and foreclosure.

My amendment, which is part of this en bloc amendment, seeks to 
alleviate these concerns. It simply expands the military's existing 
preseparation counseling program to include a personal finances 
component. When this takes effect, military families will reenter 
civilian life with the information they need to build a stable, long-
term financial future.

I encourage all of my colleagues to support our military families by 
supporting this amendment.

Secondly, Mr. Chairman, throughout both of our Democratic and 
Republican administrations, the White House has maintained a policy 
against providing letters of condolences to the families of suicide 
victims. This is a major issue for my constituency, which I have been 
working on for months.

I have had a number communications with the White House and with the 
Department of Defense expressing these concerns. Fortunately, the 
President was kind enough to send a personal letter of condolence to a 
local family who was affected by suicide.

I would like to wholeheartedly thank President Obama for this 
meaningful gesture, and I encourage him to continue on this path and to 
finally overturn this misguided White House policy.

Our men and women in uniform sacrifice for our country both 
physically and mentally, but despite the occasional exception, the 
current policy ignores the sacrifice these men and women make, and it 
disregards the suffering of their families.
