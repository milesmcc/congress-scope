Mr. LOEBSACK. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, and 
I'm going to speak not to what was, but what is today and what should 
be in the future.

I rise today in strong support of this conference agreement and the 
rule, especially the agreement's increased funding for both the NIH and 
the veterans health care system.

I have seen firsthand the amazing advancements in research that are 
brought about through NIH funding. The University of Iowa's per capita 
NIH research productivity is ranked sixth among public universities in 
this Nation. Their important work benefits both Iowa and the Nation.

Unfortunately, over the past 5 years funding for the NIH has fallen 
behind biomedical inflation, and we all suffer from these setbacks as 
advancements in treatment and cures for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's 
and many other diseases are jeopardized. That's why I strongly support 
the increased funding for the NIH and other health care programs in 
this conference report today.

In recent years, important veterans health care funding has also 
fallen behind. I could not be more proud that this conference report 
also includes the single largest increase in veterans funding in the 
VA's 77-year history.

By providing $37.2 billion for VA hospitals and clinics, we will 
ensure that the VA has the resources and oversight necessary to ensure 
that veterans receive excellent health care, rehabilitation services, 
and system-wide support. This funding will also provide research into 
the treatment of traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress 
disorder, two devastating conditions that Iraq and Afghanistan veterans 
face all too frequently and will into the future.

I strongly believe that bold action such as this conference report is 
necessary to address our Nation's and our veterans' health care needs. 
Today, we are taking an important step forward. We are telling America 
that we have our priorities right, and I urge my colleagues to support 
this rule and the conference report.
