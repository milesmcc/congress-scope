`Mr. POLIS â€” 8 October 2009`

---


Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the 
bill. I would like to thank Chairwoman Slaughter for the time on the 
rule as well as House Armed Services Chairman Skelton and Ranking 
Member McKeon for their tireless work on this bill. Their job is not 
easy.

Our Nation faces a war on two fronts and growing threats to our 
security here and abroad. As our economy struggles to recover from a 
meltdown, the resources we have available to devote to these problems 
are under increasing pressure.

It's time we bring our troops home from both Iraq and Afghanistan. I 
commend President Obama and his efforts to end our military presence in 
Iraq and look forward to helping him achieve this goal soon.

I am concerned, however, about the possible increase of troops in 
Afghanistan. We cannot achieve peace through the occupation of an 
entire country. The occupation of Afghanistan will not help us defeat 
the very real threat of al Qaeda. We need to take a new look at our 
policy, moving towards targeted operations against al Qaeda rather than 
the occupation of an entire country. And this can only come about 
through discussion and debate.

We need an exit strategy for Afghanistan, a plan for peace. This bill 
promotes such a plan by requiring assessment of goals in Afghanistan 
with timelines and by increasing numbers in the Afghan National 
Security Forces to prepare for the transition.

Recognizing, however, that this authorization will inevitably 
continue war efforts inherited from the previous administration, I take 
great pause in deciding to support it. But at its heart, this 
authorization is about more than our policy towards Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this authorization today because, in 
doing so, Congress finally--after nearly a decade of debate--has the 
opportunity to pass historic hate crimes legislation. My home State of 
Colorado has long had hate crimes legislation on the books, including 
gays and lesbians, and I am proud to stand before you as a 
representative of the Second Congressional District and as an original 
cosponsor of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 
2009 which is included in this Defense authorization bill.

Our hate crimes legislation expands Federal jurisdiction to 
investigate and prosecute hate crimes and provides law enforcement with 
another means of ensuring that the safety and rights of all Americans 
are protected. It offers Federal protection for victims of hate crimes 
targeted because of their race, color, religion, national origin, 
sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability, as well as 
protecting men and women who proudly wear the uniform of the United 
States from hate crimes. It also provides assistance to State and local 
law enforcement agencies and amends Federal law to aid in the 
prosecution of bias-motivated crimes.


Hate crimes are not limited to the LGBT community. They occur every 
day in every State and perpetuate a climate of fear throughout minority 
communities. What makes these crimes so odious is that they are not 
just crimes against individuals; they're crimes against entire 
communities and create environments of fear in entire communities.

There is a difference between burning a cross on the lawn of an 
African American family and an act of simple arson. This legislation 
clarifies that our country has zero tolerance for hate crimes.
