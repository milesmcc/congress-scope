Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, a new report from the Budget and 
Appropriations Committee says that the new Congress faces a fiscal 
challenge of historic proportions. The cost of the war in Iraq, coupled 
with the growing price tag of tax cuts passed over the previous 6 
years, have left the Nation deeper in debt than ever before and with 
one of the largest benefit deficits in the Nation's history.

Last year, Democrats committed to begin the process of restoring 
fiscal sanity by reinstituting a budget rule that helped Congress 
create a surplus in the 1990s. It is this fiscal discipline that is so 
important to House Democrats that we restored a pay-as-you-go budget 
rule on the second day of this new Congress.

Madam Speaker, historic debts are not good for any of us. They lead 
to rising interest rates, which cost middle-class families as much as 
$1,700 a year on credit card and mortgage payments. It also simply is 
irresponsible of us to continue to pass this debt on to future 
generations.

Madam Speaker, this week we will pass a final budget for the 2007 
fiscal year after Republicans refused to pass these must-pass 
appropriations bills last year. It's time we get our fiscal house in 
order.
