# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `2608b1819e97dc5003e610299c603d2a`
`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I would say to my good friend 
from American Samoa that one of the reasons why I do refer to General 
Petraeus is he is one of those who put this plan together and he says 
it will work, and for people to belittle his plan or to ridicule it or 
to adopt for the first time in history a resolution attacking his 
strategic plan is an attack on either his credibility or his 
competency. You can't have it both ways.

Madam Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut 
(Mr. Shays), who has been to Iraq 15 times.
