# FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008
## `7c9bbfe25654ac5952a786dfb26bd865`
`Mr. FEINGOLD â€” 9 July 2008`

---


Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. Before I get into my formal remarks, let me react a bit to the 
remarks of the Senator from Utah. He is a great colleague, a very 
cordial man. I have enjoyed the 16 years I have served with him, 
especially on the Judiciary Committee. But I will use an unsenatorial 
word for one of the arguments he made. The word is ''wow.'' The notion 
that roughly 70 Senators would not be briefed on something we are 
voting on and the notion that the briefing of the Intelligence 
Committee, which, of course, I am a member of and which I support, is a 
justification for having 70 Senators not knowing what they are voting 
on is a very bizarre interpretation of why the Intelligence Committee 
was created. It was not created as a replacement for the Senate when it 
comes to voting on the laws governing the fundamental rights of the 
American people. If that is the best they can come up with, when 70 
Senators don't even know the fundamentals of the program that this 
immunity issue is addressing, it is incredible. Let me get into the 
merits, but first I should also address that we have apparently been 
lumped in as part of the black helicopter crowd. I assure you the 
coalition in this country that has concerns about this bill is much 
broader than any such characterization.

A number of Senators came to the floor prior to the Fourth of July 
recess to debate the FISA legislation, and more debate has occurred 
this week.


We heard arguments for and against this legislation, and Senators have 
cited a variety of reasons for their positions.

Several have defended the bill by arguing the legislation includes 
improvements compared to the Senate bill we passed earlier this year. 
Of course, I was not surprised to hear that line of argument. I agree, 
there are some improvements to the Senate bill contained in the 
legislation we are now considering. But Mr. President, those changes, 
as you well know, are not nearly enough to justify supporting the bill, 
as I will explain in a few moments.

I was, however, surprised to hear several Senators still defending 
the legality of the President's warrantless wiretapping program and 
still arguing that Congress had somehow signed off on this program 
years ago because the so-called Gang of 8 group was notified.

I thought we were well past these arguments. Two and a half years 
after this illegal program became public, I cannot believe we are still 
debating the legality of this program on the Senate floor and that 
anyone--anyone--seriously believes that merely notifying the Gang of 
8--eight Senators and Congressmen--while keeping the full Intelligence 
Committees in the dark, somehow represents congressional approval.

It could not be clearer that this program broke the law and that this 
President--this President--broke the law. Not only that, but this 
administration affirmatively misled the Congress and the American 
people about it for years before it finally became public. So if we are 
going to go back and discuss these issues that I thought had long since 
been put to rest, let's take a few minutes to cover the full history.

Here is the part of this story that somehow seems to have been 
forgotten. In January 2005, 11 months before the New York Times broke 
the story of the illegal wiretapping program, I asked then-White House 
Counsel Alberto Gonzales at his confirmation hearing to be Attorney 
General whether the President had the power to authorize warrantless 
wiretaps in violation of the criminal law. Neither I nor the vast 
majority of my colleagues knew it then, but the President had 
authorized the NSA program 3 years before, and Mr. Gonzales was 
directly involved in that issue as White House Counsel.

At his confirmation hearing, he first tried to dismiss my question--
if you can believe it--as ''hypothetical,'' though he knew exactly what 
was going on. He then testified:




 [I]t's not the policy or the agenda of this President to 


 authorize actions that would be in contravention of our 


 criminal statutes.


The President's wiretapping program was in direct contravention of 
our criminal statutes. Mr. Gonzales knew that, but he wanted the Senate 
and the American people to think the President had not acted on the 
extreme legal theory that the President has the power as Commander in 
Chief to disobey the criminal laws of this country.

The President, too, misled the Congress and the American public. In 
2004 and 2005, when Congress was considering the reauthorization of the 
USA PATRIOT Act, the President went out of his way--I remember this 
very clearly--to assure us that his administration was getting court 
orders for wiretaps, all the while knowing full well that his 
warrantless wiretapping program was ongoing.

Here is what the President said on April 20, 2004:




 Now, by the way, any time you hear the United States 


 government talking about [a] wiretap, it requires--a wiretap 


 requires a court order. Nothing has changed, by the way. When 


 we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking 


 about getting a court order before we do so.


Those are the words of the President of the United States to the 
American people.

Again, on July 14, 2004:




 The government can't move on wiretaps or roving wiretaps 


 without getting a court order.


And listen to what the President said on June 9, 2005:




 Law enforcement officers need a federal judge's permission 


 to wiretap a foreign terrorist's phone, a federal judge's 


 permission to track his calls, or a federal judge's 


 permission to search his property. Officers must meet strict 


 standards to use any of these tools. And these standards are 


 fully consistent with the Constitution of the U.S.


So please, let's not pretend that the highly classified notification 
to the Gang of 8, delivered while the President himself was repeatedly 
presenting a completely different picture to the public, suggests that 
Congress somehow acquiesced to this program. As the Members of this 
body well know, several Members of the Gang of 8 at the time raised 
concerns when they were told about this, and several have since said 
they were not told the full story. And, of course, all of them--all of 
them--were instructed not to share what they had learned with a single 
other person.

I also cannot leave unanswered the arguments mounted in defense of 
the legality of the NSA program. I will not spend much time on the 
argument that the authorization for use of military force that Congress 
passed on September 18, 2001, authorized this program. That argument 
has been thoroughly discredited. In the AUMF, Congress authorized the 
President to use military force against those who attacked us on 9/11, 
a necessary and justified response to the attacks. We did not authorize 
the President to wiretap American citizens on American soil without 
going through the judicial process that was set up nearly three decades 
ago precisely to facilitate the domestic surveillance of spies and 
terrorists.

Senators have also dragged out the same old, tired arguments about 
the President's supposed inherent Executive authority to violate the 
FISA statute. They argue that a law passed by Congress cannot trump the 
President's power under the Constitution. Now, that argument may sound 
good, but it assumes what it is trying to prove--that the Constitution 
gives the President the power to authorize warrantless wiretaps in 
certain cases. You cannot simply say that any claim of Executive power 
prevails over a statute--at least, not if you are serious about the 
rule of law and about how to interpret the Constitution.


The real question is, when a claim of Executive power and a statute 
arguably conflict, how do you resolve that conflict?

Fortunately, this is not something the Supreme Court has been silent 
about. The Supreme Court has told us how to answer that question. We 
are talking about the President acting in direct violation of a 
criminal statute. That means his power was, as Justice Jackson said in 
his famous and influential concurrence in the Steel Seizure cases half 
a century ago, ''at its lowest ebb.'' The Presidential power, Justice 
Jackson said, in that circumstance was ''at its lowest ebb.'' In other 
words, when a President argues that he has the power to violate a 
specific law, he is on shaky ground.

That is, obviously, not just my opinion. It is what the Supreme Court 
has made clear. No less an authority than the current Chief Justice of 
the United States, John Roberts, repeatedly recognized in his 
confirmation hearings--over and over again--that Justice Jackson's 
three-part test is the appropriate framework for analyzing questions of 
Executive power.

In early 2006, a distinguished group of law professors and former 
executive branch officials wrote a letter pointing out that ''every 
time''--every time--''the Supreme Court has confronted a statute 
limiting the Commander-in-Chief's authority, it has upheld the 
statute.'' It has upheld the act of Congress over the claims of 
Executive power that overreach and conflict with the power of this 
Congress to make the laws in this country.

The Senate reports issued when FISA was enacted confirm the 
understanding that FISA overrode any preexisting inherent authority of 
the President. The 1978 Senate Judiciary Committee report stated that 
FISA ''recognizes no inherent power of the President in this area'' and 
''Congress has declared that this statute, not any claimed Presidential 
power, controls.''

Contrary to what has been said on this floor, no court has ever 
approved warrantless surveillance in violation of FISA based on some 
theory of article II authority. The Truong case that is so often hauled 
out to make this argument was a Vietnam-era case based on surveillance 
that occurred before FISA was enacted, so it could not have decided 
this issue. And the issue before the FISA Court of Review in 2002 had 
nothing to do with inherent Presidential authorities. Yet these cases 
are repeatedly cited by supporters of the President, complete with 
large charts


of the supposedly relevant quotations. But the fact is, not a single 
court--not the Supreme Court or any other court--has considered 
whether, after FISA was enacted, the President nonetheless somehow has 
the authority to bypass it and authorize warrantless wiretaps.

In fact, as the Senator from Pennsylvania and I discussed on the 
Senate floor yesterday, just last week a Federal district court 
strongly indicated that were it to reach that issue, it would find that 
the President must in fact follow FISA. The court was considering 
whether the state secrets privilege applies to claims brought under the 
FISA civil liability provisions, and it found that it does not. Its 
reasoning was based on the conclusion, again, that Congress had spoken 
clearly that it intended FISA and the criminal wiretap laws to be the 
exclusive means--the exclusive means--by which electronic surveillance 
is conducted, and it fully occupied the field in this area, replacing 
any otherwise applicable common law.

Now, here is what the court said:




 Congress appears clearly to have intended to--and did--


 establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence 


 surveillance activities to be conducted. Whatever power the 


 Executive may otherwise have had in this regard, FISA limits 


 the power of the executive branch to conduct such activities 


 . . .


And another court, a district court in Michigan, has also held that 
the President's wiretapping program was unconstitutional, although that 
decision was reversed on procedural grounds by the Sixth Circuit. So to 
the extent there is any case law that actually addresses this issue, it 
totally undercuts the administration's arguments. And, of course, it 
certainly does nothing to support those arguments.

We have also heard that past American Presidents have cited Executive 
authority to order warrantless surveillance. But, of course, those past 
Presidents--Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt are often cited--were 
acting before the Supreme Court decided in 1967 that our communications 
are protected by the Fourth Amendment and before Congress decided in 
1978 that the executive branch can no longer unilaterally decide which 
Americans to wiretap. So those examples are simply not relevant to this 
debate.

In sum, the arguments that the President has inherent Executive 
authority to violate the law are baseless. It is not even a close case. 
And the repeated efforts in the Senate to pretend otherwise are very 
discouraging.

It may seem that I am going over ancient history because this program 
is no longer operating outside the law. But this is directly relevant 
to the current debate. The bill the Senate is considering would 
actually grant retroactive immunity to any companies that cooperated 
with a blatantly illegal program that went on for more than 5 years and 
about which the administration repeatedly misled Congress.

So if Congress short-circuits these lawsuits, we will have lost a 
prime opportunity to finally achieve accountability for these many 
years of lawbreaking. That is why the administration has been fighting 
so hard for this immunity. It knows that the cases that have been 
brought directly against the Government face much more difficult 
procedural barriers and are unlikely to result in rulings on the merits 
that would allow us to get to this direct question of the legality of 
the President's warrantless wiretapping program.

These lawsuits involving the telephone companies may be the last 
chance to obtain a judicial ruling on the lawfulness of the warrantless 
wiretapping program. It is bad enough that Congress abdicated its 
responsibility to hold the President accountable for breaking the law. 
Now it is trying to absolve those who allegedly participated in his 
lawlessness. This body should be condemning this administration for its 
lawbreaking--not letting the companies that allegedly cooperated off 
the hook.

This body certainly should not grant the Government new, 
overexpansive surveillance authorities, which brings me now to the part 
of the bill that in some ways concerns me even more than the immunity 
provision. Let me explain why I am so concerned about the new 
surveillance powers granted in this bill and why the modest 
improvements made to this part of the bill do not even come close to 
going far enough.

First, the FISA Amendments Act would authorize the Government to 
collect all--all--communications between the United States and the rest 
of the world. Now, that could mean millions upon millions of 
communications between innocent Americans and their friends, families, 
or business associates overseas could be legally collected. Parents 
calling their kids studying abroad, e-mails to friends serving in 
Iraq--all these communications could be collected, with absolutely no 
suspicion of any wrongdoing at all, under this legislation.

Second, like the earlier Senate version, this bill fails to 
effectively prohibit a practice known as reverse targeting; namely, 
wiretapping a person overseas when what the Government is really 
interested in doing is listening to an American here at home with whom 
the foreigner is communicating. This bill does have a provision that 
purports to address this issue. It prohibits intentionally targeting a 
person outside the United States without an individualized court order 
if ''the purpose'' is to target someone reasonably believed to be in 
the United States.

But this does not do the job. At best, this prevents the Government 
from targeting a person overseas as a complete pretext for getting 
information on someone in the United States. But this language would 
allow a lot more. The language would permit intentional and possibly 
unconstitutional warrantless surveillance of an American so long as the 
Government has any interest--any interest at all--no matter how small, 
in the person overseas with whom the American is communicating. The 
bill does not include language that had the support of the House and 
the vast majority of the Senate's Democratic caucus that would have 
required the Government to obtain a court order whenever a significant 
purpose of the surveillance was to acquire the communications of an 
American in the United States. The administration's refusal to accept 
that reasonable restriction on its power is quite telling.


Third, the bill before us imposes no meaningful consequences if the 
Government initiates surveillance using procedures that have not been 
approved by the FISA Court, and the FISA Court later finds that those 
procedures were unlawful. Say, for example, the FISA Court determines 
that the procedures were not even reasonably designed to wiretap 
foreigners outside the United States rather than Americans at home. 
Under this bill, all that illegally obtained information on Americans 
can be retained and used. Once again, as seems to recur over and over 
again in this sordid tale, there are no consequences for illegal 
behavior by the Government of the United States. That is just wrong.

Unlike the Senate bill, this new bill does generally provide for FISA 
Court review of surveillance procedures before surveillance begins, and 
that is one of the changes that has been touted by supporters of the 
bill. But the bill also says if the Attorney General and the Director 
of National Intelligence certify they don't have time to get a court 
order, and that intelligence important to national security may be lost 
or not timely acquired, then they can go forward without traditional 
approval. This is a far cry from allowing an exception to FISA Court 
review in a true emergency because, arguably, all intelligence is 
important to national security and any delay at all might cause some 
intelligence to be lost. So I am concerned that this so-called 
''exigency'' exception could very well swallow the rule and undermine 
any presumption at all of prior judicial approval. That could result in 
no prior court review. No prior judicial review. Let's just trust an 
administration--including this administration--rather than having the 
checks and balances that clearly the Founders of our country understood 
to be central in any situation such as this.

Fourth, this bill doesn't protect the privacy of Americans whose 
communications will be collected in vast new quantities. The 
administration's mantra has been: Don't worry, we have minimization 
procedures. But minimization procedures are nothing more


than unchecked executive branch decisions about what information on 
Americans constitutes ''foreign intelligence.'' That is why on the 
Senate floor I joined with Senator Webb and Senator Tester earlier this 
year to offer an amendment to provide real protections for the privacy 
of Americans, while also giving the Government the flexibility that it 
needs to wiretap terrorists overseas.

This bill relies solely on inadequate minimization procedures to 
protect innocent Americans, and they are simply not enough.

As I said at the outset, some supporters of this bill have pointed to 
improvements made since the Senate passed the bill earlier this year. I 
appreciate that some changes have been made, but those changes are 
either inadequate or they do not go to the core privacy issues raised 
by this bill. In fact, as the distinguished Senator from Missouri, the 
vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said just 
yesterday, the bill before us is ''basically the Senate bill all over 
again'' with only ''cosmetic fixes.'' That is what the Republican vice 
chairman of the committee said. Any Democrat who suggests that this is 
somehow a big change, I don't think they read the bill, because it 
doesn't do the job.

For example, I am pleased the bill provides for FISA Court review of 
targeting minimization procedures, but as I mentioned, there is a 
potentially gaping loophole allowing the executive branch to go forward 
with surveillance without court review--an exception that could swallow 
the rule. The bill also now explicitly directs the FISA Court to 
consider whether the Government's procedures comply with the fourth 
amendment, but that is an authority it should have had anyway.

The bill includes an inspector general review of the illegal program, 
which is a positive change, but that doesn't make up for the lawsuits 
that are going to be dismissed as a result of this legislation. I 
strongly support the strengthened exclusivity language which, perhaps, 
may defer a future administration from engaging in lawless behavior, 
but let's not lose sight of the fact that FISA, as originally enacted, 
clearly stated already that it and the criminal wiretap laws were the 
exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance. This was 
confirmed in the strongest terms possible by a Federal district court 
just last week.

The idea that we would simply trust this administration, especially, 
to follow this exclusivity language when they have taken such a 
dismissive attitude with respect to the current exclusivity language is 
absurd. Only under the unprecedented legal theories of this 
administration could that clear language be ignored, requiring Congress 
to pass language that effectively says: No, we really mean it. If this 
bill is enacted, I am by no means reassured that this administration, 
which repeatedly broke the law and misled the public over the past 7 
years, will now respect the exclusivity of FISA.

Now, the bill does contain a key protection for Americans traveling 
overseas. It says if the Government wants to intentionally target 
Americans while they are outside of the country, it has to get an 
individualized FISA Court order based on probable cause. That is a 
great victory, and it is one we should be proud of, but it does not 
override the greatly expanded authorities in this bill to collect other 
types of communications involving Americans.

In sum, these improvements are obviously not enough. They are nowhere 
close. So I must strongly oppose this bill.


When you consider how we got here, this legislation is particularly 
discouraging. We discovered in late 2005 that the President had 
authorized an illegal program in blatant violation of a statute and 
that Congress and the public had been misled in a variety of ways 
leading up to this public revelation. Congress, to its credit, held 
hearings on the program, but was largely stonewalled by the 
administration for many months until the administration grudgingly 
agreed to brief the intelligence committees and, more recently, the 
judiciary committees. Nonetheless, the vast majority in the House and 
Senate have never been told what happened. In 2006, when the 
Republicans tried to push through legislation to grant massive new 
surveillance authority to the executive branch, we stopped it. But now, 
in a Democratic-controlled Congress not only did we pass the Protect 
America Act, but we are now about to extend for more than 4 years these 
expansive surveillance powers, and we are about to grant immunity to 
companies that are alleged to have participated in the administration's 
lawlessness.

I sit on the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. I am one of the 
few Members of this body who has been fully briefed on the warrantless 
wiretapping program. Based on what I know, I can promise that if more 
information is declassified about the program in the future, as is 
likely to happen either due to the inspectors general report, the 
election of a new President, or simply the passage of time, Members of 
this body will regret that we passed this legislation. I am also 
familiar with the collection activities that have been conducted under 
the Protect America Act and will continue under this bill. I invite any 
of my colleagues who wish to know more about these activities to come 
speak to me in a classified setting. Publicly, all I can say is that I 
have serious concerns about how those activities may have impacted the 
civil liberties of all Americans. If we grant these new powers to the 
Government and the effects become known to the American people, we will 
realize what a mistake it was. Of that, I am sure.

So I hope my colleagues will think long and hard about their votes on 
this bill and consider how they and their constituents will feel about 
this vote 5, 10, or 20 years from now. I am confident that history will 
not judge this Senate kindly if it endorses this tragic retreat from 
the principles that have governed government conduct in this sensitive 
area for 30 years. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the rule of law 
and defeat this bill.

I reserve the remainder of my time.
