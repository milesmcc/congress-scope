Mr. LEVIN. I thank my dear friend from Vermont. I join him also in 
telling the Senate just how pleased we are to see the Presiding Officer 
sitting where he is. We have worked together on many issues. We have 
traveled together. His commitment to such critical issues as 
immigration, environment, energy, and a number of other issues has made 
a real difference. He is a very quick study and a quick learner, as 
noted when we traveled together to Iraq and other countries. So he 
indeed fits the chair which he is sitting, and it is a pleasure to look 
at him as I address the Senate for a few minutes this afternoon.
