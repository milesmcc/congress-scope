Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, when we use the term ''slow bleed,'' 
let's think about what that means. If you are going to torture your 
enemy or want somebody to have the most painful death possible, you 
give them a slow bleed. You let them bleed out very slowly. You are a 
doctor and you know that can be the most painful death in the world.


That is what they are doing, is a slow bleed. It is going to be a 
painful death, not only for our military and for the victory we want to 
have in Iraq and Afghanistan, but for those people that the colonel is 
talking about. And those people have been our allies in this. Those are 
the people that believe with all their heart and mind and soul and 
every breath that they want to breathe freedom and liberty. Those are 
the people that believe in what we believe in, and they have pulled 
alongside of us to make this work. Those are the first ones that are 
going to be slaughtered.

So thanks for giving me the opportunity to come down and speak, and 
thanks for doing the Truth Squad. I just look forward to continuing 
this debate one day.
