Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, today I come to the 
floor to honor an individual who has sacrificed over 42 years of his 
life for this great Nation.

Brigadier General James P. Combs has proudly and gallantly served his 
country on foreign soil in the countries of Vietnam, Afghanistan, and 
Iraq. He was appointed Commander of our Joint Forces Training Base in 
Los Alamitos, California, on November 1, 2005. General Combs retired 
from Federal service on October 1, 2007, at which time Governor 
Schwarzenegger assigned him in a State active duty position to remain 
as the base commander.

On July 4, 2009, in just a little over a week, General Combs will 
retire from the United States Armed Forces. And on behalf of those who 
have had the honor to serve with him and a grateful Nation, I commend 
him on his numerous accomplishments, his outstanding leadership, and 
his incredible military career.

Brigadier General James P. Combs will always remain a soldier's 
soldier and a true American hero.
