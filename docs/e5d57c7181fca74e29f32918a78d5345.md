Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th 
Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several 
votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ''yea'' on final passage 
of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the


Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to 
Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States 
Armed Forces in Iraq; ''yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, 
recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of 
fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United 
States and throughout the world for their faith; ''yea'' on final 
passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights 
advocates in Iran; ''yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide 
compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as 
a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on 
August 7, 1998; and ''yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, 
condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful 
demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional 
release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
