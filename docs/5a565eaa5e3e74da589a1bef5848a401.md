Mr. HOYER. Thank you. I understand the gentleman's concern about 
Iraq, but I want to say, first of all, that all of us understand on 
this floor that there is no issue which has the attention more than 
Iraq of the American people, number one.

Number two, the American people feel it is a critically important 
issue. Not only does it have their attention, but they think it's 
critically important.

And my friend will remember, I think, returning here, I received a 
call Saturday afternoon that we were going to have a session on Sunday. 
Many of our Members were overseas. But the issue was perceived as so 
important by the majority leader that he reconvened us, with the 
Speaker's participation, as you recall, on the following Sunday 
afternoon.



We voted on a bill that many felt was a very important bill that 
hadn't gone through a committee late that Sunday evening.

Many people in this country and on this side of the aisle and I think 
on your side of the aisle feel that Iraq is a critical issue. So I say 
with all respect, we do intend to continue to address this issue, and 
we hope the votes do change. If they don't change, they don't change. 
There is nothing we can do about that. But we can continue to focus on 
an issue we think is critically important.
