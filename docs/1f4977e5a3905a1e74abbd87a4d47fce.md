`Mr. PENCE â€” 14 March 2008`

Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, YouTube is an amazing thing. As the fifth 
anniversary of the war in Iraq will be commemorated across the country 
in recent days, the statistics tell the tale.

Because of the military surge and Sunni cooperation, we are making 
significant progress towards stability and freedom in Iraq. Violence is 
down more than 60 percent last year. But as the saying goes, ''seeing 
is believing.'' And thanks to this miracle that is called youtube.com, 
Americans can join me for a walk down the streets of al Anbar province 
in Haditha, Iraq.

On March 2, with a military security detail, our bipartisan 
delegation walked the streets of this war-torn city and I posted 15 
minutes of unedited interviews with local Iraqis on youtube.com.

The fight is far from over, but we are making significant progress in 
Iraq. I hope many of my colleagues and many Americans will go to 
youtube.com, type in ''Mike Pence,'' and take a look for themselves at 
what Sunni cooperation and the American military have wrought in Iraq.
