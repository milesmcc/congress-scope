Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I would like to submit 
the following op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal on November 
12, 2008, by Masoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 
It conveys the strong and important relationship between the Iraqi 
Kurdish population and the United States as well as their efforts to 
help build a peaceful Iraq. I was fortunate this year to visit the 
Kurdistan Region, and I know firsthand of Kurdish appreciation of the 
American people.

Kurdistan Is a Model for Iraq--Our Path to a Secular, Federal Democracy 












is Inspired by the U.S.














(By Masoud Barzani)




 Iraq's Kurds have consistently been America's closest 


 allies in Iraq. Our Peshmerga forces fought alongside the 


 U.S. military to liberate the country, suffering more 


 casualties than any other U.S. ally.



 And while some Iraqi politicians have challenged the U.S.-


 Iraq security agreement, Iraq's Kurdish leaders have endorsed 


 the pact as essential for U.S. combat troops to continue 


 fighting terrorists in Iraq.



 The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is committed to a 


 federal, democratic Iraq that is at peace with its neighbors.



 We have benefited enormously from the service and 


 sacrifices of America's armed forces and their families, and 


 we are deeply grateful. We are also proud to have shared in 


 such sacrifices; my brother was among those severely wounded 


 during the liberation of Iraq.



 Last year, following a U.S. request, we deployed Kurdish 


 troops to Baghdad. These




 troops played a decisive role in the success of the surge. 


 Last month I once again visited Baghdad to meet with the 


 leadership of the federal government. We stressed our 


 commitment to developing an Iraqi state that abides by its 


 constitution and that is based upon a federal model with 


 clearly delineated powers for its regions.



 In spite of all this, some commentators now suggest that 


 the Kurds are causing problems by insisting on territorial 


 demands and proceeding with the development of Kurdistan's 


 oil resources. These allegations are troubling. We are 


 proceeding entirely in accord with the Iraqi constitution, 


 implementing provisions that were brokered by the U.S.



 In the constitutional negotiations that took place in the 


 summer of 2005, two issues were critical to us: first, that 


 the Kurdistan Region has the right to develop the oil on its 


 territory, and second, that there be a fair process to 


 determine the administrative borders of Iraq's Kurdistan 


 Region--thus resolving once and for all the issue of 


 ''disputed'' territories.



 Unfortunately, ever since the discovery of oil in Iraq in 


 the 1920s, successive Iraqi governments have sought to keep 


 oil out of Kurdish hands, blocking exploration and 


 development of fields in Kurdistan. Saddam Hussein's 


 government went even further, using Iraqi oil revenues to 


 finance the military campaigns that destroyed more than 4,500 


 Kurdish villages and to pay for the poison gas used to kill 


 thousands of Kurdish civilians.



 The Kurdish leadership agreed to a U.S.-sponsored 


 compromise in 2005 in which the central government would have 


 the authority to manage existing oil fields, but new fields 


 would fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the regions. 


 Since then, the KRG has taken the lead with Baghdad in 


 negotiations on a hydrocarbon law that is faithful to Iraq's 


 constitution and is conducive to modernizing Iraq's oil 


 infrastructure and substantially increasing its oil 


 production.



 We have awarded contracts for foreign oil companies 


 (including some American ones) to explore our territory. In 


 so doing, Kurdistan is not threatening the unity of Iraq. It 


 is simply implementing the constitution.



 The ''disputed territories'' have a tragic history. Since 


 the 1950s, Iraqi regimes encouraged Arabs to settle in Kirkuk 


 and other predominantly Kurdish and Turkmen areas. Saddam 


 Hussein accelerated this process by engaging in ethnic 


 cleansing, expelling or killing Kurds and Turkmen, or by 


 requiring nationality corrections (in which non-Arabs are 


 forced to declare themselves to be Arabs) and by moving Arabs 


 into Kurdish homes.



 The dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds over Kirkuk has 


 lasted more than 80 years and has often been violent. All 


 sides have now agreed to a formula to resolve the problem, to 


 bring justice to Kirkuk, and to correct the crimes against 


 Kurds committed by Saddam Hussein's regime. Iraq's 


 constitution requires that a referendum be held in disputed 


 territories to determine if their populations want to join 


 the Kurdistan Region. Conducting a plebiscite is not easy, 


 but it is preferable to another 80 years of conflict.



 If the pro-Kurdistan side should lose the referendum in 


 Kirkuk, I promise that Kurdistan will respect that result. 


 And if they win, I promise that we will do everything in our 


 power to ensure outsized representation of Kirkuk's Turkmen, 


 Arabs and Christians both on the local level and in the 


 parliament and government of the Kurdistan Region.



 Regional stability cannot come from resolving internal 


 disputes alone. That is why expanding and deepening our ties 


 with Turkey is my top priority.



 My meeting last month in Baghdad with the Turkish special 


 envoy to Iraq was a historic and positive development. There 


 should be further direct contacts between the KRG and Turkey, 


 as well as multilateral contacts that involve the U.S. We are 


 eager to work with Turkey to seek increased peace and 


 prosperity in the region.



 I am proud that the Kurdistan Region is both a model and 


 gateway for the rest of Iraq. Our difficult path to a 


 secular, federal democracy is very much inspired by the U.S. 


 And so we look forward to working with the Obama-Biden 


 administration to support and defend our hard-fought 


 successes in Iraq, and to remain proud of what the Kurdistan 


 region is today: a thriving civil society in the heart of the 


 Middle East. When we insist on strict compliance with our 


 country's constitution, we are only following America's great 


 example.
