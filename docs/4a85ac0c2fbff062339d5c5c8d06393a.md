`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 18 December 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Murphy was running for office a year and 
some change ago, talking about if he gets to Congress what he would do 
for his constituents, that he would provide the kind of representation 
that they deserve, turn this saga of Iraq and that other issue of Iraq 
back to domestic priorities, bring home the bacon on behalf of the 
district and his constituents.

I'm so glad that he's here tonight because we've been here three 
times. This is his first time. I'm glad that he's here because I want 
to know what's wrong. I mean, I just, Mr. Speaker, I personally want to 
know what's wrong with coming to Washington, DC, representing your 
constituents, and doing what you said you would do.
