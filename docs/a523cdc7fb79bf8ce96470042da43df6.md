Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 734, a 
resolution that discloses the corruptive withholding of information in 
Iraq. The Administration cannot continue to hide corruption in the 
Iraqi Government. We cannot allow this abuse of the classification 
process. Americans have the right to know the truth about the situation 
in Iraq. The fact of the matter is, our military presence in Iraq is 
not making our country any safer. Instead, in my district alone, we 
have lost 13 brave young men to this war.

The Iraq War is costing the American taxpayers ten billion dollars a 
month. With the money we have spent in Iraq, we could have hired an 
additional 7.8 million teachers. Americans should be outraged by this 
abuse of the system. Americans are paying for the war with their money 
and more importantly, the lives of their loved ones. I urge my 
colleagues to cast a vote for honesty and accountability by supporting 
this resolution.
