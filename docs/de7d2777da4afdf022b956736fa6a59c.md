`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 21 July 2009`

---


Mr. LIEBERMAN. My friend from Arizona is absolutely right. There is 
no doubt, based on the demand, certainly temporarily, over the next 18 
months, perhaps 2 years, as we are drawing down in Iraq, but not as 
rapidly as we are adding forces in Afghanistan, that there is at least 
a temporary need for more than the authorized 547,000 members of the 
U.S. Army.
