`Mr. DAVIS of Illinois â€” 28 February 2008`

---


Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly the gentleman 
from Georgia, in the consideration of H.R. 3936, which names a postal 
facility in Cleveland, Georgia, after a fallen hero, Sergeant Jason 
Harkins.

Introduced on October 23, 2007, H.R. 3936 is sponsored by Congressman 
Nathan Deal, the Representative from Georgia's Ninth Congressional 
District and cosponsored by the entire Georgia delegation. Mr. Deal's 
measure, H.R. 3936, was reported from the Oversight Committee on 
January 29, 2008, by voice vote.

This morning's postal-naming bill honoring Sergeant Jason Harkins 
brings to light the special story of a staunch soldier who, along with 
five of his comrades from the Army's 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division 
out of Fort Lewis, Washington, were tragically killed while serving our 
country nobly in the Baqubah region of Iraq. Sadly, none of the six 
soldiers killed in one of the deadliest attacks on the Fort Lewis unit 
lived to see his 30th birthday. Yet, as soldiers, Sergeant Jason 
Harkins and his fellow servicemen, all of whom had entered active duty 
service within only the past 6 years, bravely placed their lives on the 
front line in allegiance and service to this great country of ours.

At the heart of this story is the subject of H.R. 3936, Sergeant 
Jason R. Harkins. Sergeant Harkins was only 25 years old and serving 
his second tour of duty in Iraq when he succumbed to wounds sustained 
from an improvised explosive device that detonated near his vehicle 
during combat operations.

A native of the northern Georgia town of Clarksville, Sergeant 
Harkins attended and graduated from the State's public school system 
before enlisting in the Army Reserve in 1999 and later volunteering for 
active duty service in December of 2002.

Described as a true God-fearing country boy, Sergeant Harkins proudly 
served over 3 years in the U.S. Army Reserves and is a recipient of the 
Bronze Star of Valor and the Purple Heart.

In addition to these honors, Mr. Speaker, let us also pay tribute to 
the life of Sergeant Harkins and pass H.R. 3936 and designate the Helen 
Highway Post Office Building in Cleveland, Georgia, in his honor.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
