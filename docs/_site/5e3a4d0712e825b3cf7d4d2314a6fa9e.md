Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, it has really been an honor 
to present this resolution today.

I was recalling the trip that we last made to Kandahar, Afghanistan. 
We had an opportunity to meet with about 40-plus, maybe 50, women there 
in all of the different services, just asking them about why they were 
there and about why they joined the service. The kind of work they were 
doing was truly inspiring; and, of course, they always wanted to tell 
us about their children, who were at home.

These women are providing a tremendous service to our country. We 
honor them, and I certainly encourage and know that all of my 
colleagues will be supporting this resolution.
