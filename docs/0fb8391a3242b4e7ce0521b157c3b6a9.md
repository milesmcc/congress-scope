Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Sometimes the test of patriotism is 
courage. And I would simply argue that every newspaper headline is not 
true. We, the Democrats, maintain the courage that America has asked us 
to exhibit, the love and respect for our soldiers, full funding in the 
emergency supplemental.

We also are to push the envelope. Isn't it interesting that Secretary 
Rice is now sitting down with a Syrian official, the same 
administration criticizing the Speaker of the House, who led to begin 
the diplomatic surge?

This is a failed policy. Vietnam was not a cut and run; our soldiers 
were victorious. So are the soldiers in Iraq; they are victorious. But 
this administration has failed and failed and failed.

The Democrats will maintain their courage. They are patriots. They 
believe it is time to bring our troops home, to entrust to the Maliki 
government the responsibility of sovereignty. It is important to lead 
the Iraqi people toward peace, not use our brave and valiant soldiers 
as shooting targets for a failed and miserable policy.

Patriots stand for courage, and the Democrats are courageous and will 
continue to do so.
