`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 11 July 2007`

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, $50 million for children's health care or 5 
months more in Iraq, let the American people make that decision. Poll 
that, get the focus group out and figure that one out, where the 
American people are going to be. They're going to be with the 
leadership. They're going to be with the Speaker. They're going to be 
with the majority leader in the Senate. They're going to be for making 
these investments.

And I just love, Mr. Speaker, how our Republican counterparts went 
way back to 1992, they went into the deep parts of the Republican 
library, the CATO Institute and everywhere else, and they pulled out 
the 1992 talking points, and they've dusted them off and everything's 
socialism and union bosses. And it's typical of why they're not in 
power.
