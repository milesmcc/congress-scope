Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Berman for the hard 
work that he and the committee staff have done on reauthorization of 
this bill. A lot of work has been put into it, and I think all of us, 
as we look upon the challenges we face around the world, understand 
that there has to be a utilization of all of the tools in our foreign 
policy tool box to ensure that we take care of America's interests and 
that we gain greater support in our interests abroad.

Smart Power is a part of that effort. Smart Power allows us to 
reenergize our diplomatic work around the globe. Specifically, the 
reauthorization of this bill allows the State Department to do work 
that the Department of Defense is doing, more appropriately under the 
Department of State: international organizations, strengthening the 
Peace Corps, focusing on drug trafficking and violence along our 
southern borders. There are so many good things that this does.

Smart Power is often overlooked, but it's a vital tool in this 
foreign policy toolbox. We've seen the benefits of American Smart Power 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we need to continue to do that good work.

I thank the chairman and his staff for the importance of the 
reauthorization. I urge all of the Members to vote for this bill.
