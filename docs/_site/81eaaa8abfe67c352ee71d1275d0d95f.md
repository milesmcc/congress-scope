`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 18 December 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
Feingold amendment. Simply put, this amendment mandates withdrawal from 
Iraq within 90 days, notwithstanding the substantial progress that even 
the harshest critics acknowledge is occurring there. Further, it cuts 
off funds for those troops in 9 months. We have taken this vote three 
times already this year. That is three times we voted on this this 
year. It has failed on a bipartisan basis each time, and with good 
reason.

I urge my colleagues to oppose the Feingold amendment one more time.
