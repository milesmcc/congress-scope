Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New 
York.

I wish those on the Republican side that are objecting to this 
resolution would ask the President what is it about the word ''no'' 
that you don't understand? How many times do we have to say that there 
will be no permanent military bases in Iraq?

Sure, we have said it in legislation before, but as recently as last 
month the Secretary of Defense elaborated on the President's statement 
about envisioning a long and enduring military presence in Iraq similar 
to the Korean model. Well, imagine how that plays into the propaganda 
of our enemy. No wonder al Qaeda is gaining in strength and 
effectiveness. No wonder people are believing in what they are saying, 
because we are playing into their hands. They are saying we are there 
as occupiers of an oil-rich Arab country.

We believe that we went there as liberators, those who supported the 
war. But gosh sakes, don't play into al Qaeda's strength. Take away 
this recruiting tool and this rallying cry.

Let's pass this resolution today and say clearly and unequivocally: 
No permanent military bases in Iraq, period.
