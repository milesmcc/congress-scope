Mr. DURBIN. What I described to you is the Baker-Hamilton proposal. I 
did make exceptions for leaving troops there for training purposes and 
for hunting down al-Qaida terrorists, those specific circumstances. My 
feeling is that over a 4-to-6-month basis, we need to establish 
timelines so our troops could start moving away from Iraq and the 
Iraqis can step in. I use 10,000 a month because that is the way the 
math works if you follow Baker-Hamilton. It could be zero troops 
withdrawn or redeployed in the first 60 days, and 20,000 or 30,000 at 
some future time.

My personal belief is that until the Iraqis understand that we are 
leaving, they will not accept the responsibility to defend their own 
government and country, and they won't make the hard political 
decisions to put an end to the civil war.
