`Mr. SANDERS â€” 24 May 2007`

---


Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I will begin by quoting from an article 
today in Congress Daily by Bruce Stokes. He sets up in one paragraph 
pretty much what we are going to talk about in this amendment:




 The immigration deal under consideration in the Senate 


 raises the number of H-1B visas, a long-sought boon for the 


 high-tech industry that will provide Silicon Valley firms 


 with skilled workers at rock-bottom salaries, who will 


 bolster company profits.


This amendment I am offering now is supported by the AFL-CIO. I will 
read the few paragraphs of the letter they sent today:




 Dear Senator Sanders:



 On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing to offer strong 


 support for your amendment to the Secure Borders, Economic 


 Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act.



 Your amendment would provide scholarships in math, science, 


 engineering, and nursing for our domestic workforce by 


 increasing fees on H-1B employers.



 The last paragraph, signed by William Samuel, director of 


 the Department of Legislation for the AFL-CIO, writes this:



 It is completely irresponsible for Congress to increase yet 


 again the total annual number of available H-1B visas without 


 addressing the myriad well-documented problems associated 


 with the H-1B program, or considering long-term solutions 


 involving access to training and educational opportunities 


 for domestic workers.


That is William Samuel, director of the Department of Legislation for 
the AFL-CIO.

The amendment I am offering today also has the support of the 
Teamsters, the Programmers Guild, and the International Federation of 
Professional and Technical Engineers.

The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act is a long and complicated 
bill. It touches on a number of very important issues, and some of 
those issues I strongly agree with, no question. The time is long 
overdue that we control our borders. No question, the time is long 
overdue that we begin to hold employers--those people who are hiring 
illegal immigrants--accountable. Those items are long overdue, and we 
have to deal with them. This legislation does that. I support that.

In my view, this bill is also responsible in how it deals with the 
very contentious and difficult issue of how we respond to the reality 
that there are some 12 million illegal immigrants in this country 
today. This bill carves out a path which eventually leads to 
citizenship, and that is something I also support.

But--and here is the but: There are a number of provisions in this 
bill I do not support, that I think are going to be very harmful to the 
middle-class and working families of this country.

The amendment I am offering right now concentrates on only one aspect 
of this very long bill and of that problem. That point centers on the 
state of the economy for working people in our country and the negative 
impact this legislation will have for millions of workers--low-income 
workers and professional workers as well.

The fact is there is a war going on in America today. I am not 
talking about the war in Iraq and I am not talking about the war in 
Afghanistan; I am talking about the war against the American middle 
class, the American standard of living and, indeed, the American dream 
itself.

The American people understand very well that since George W. Bush 
has become President, an additional 5.4 million Americans have slipped 
into poverty out of the middle class--5.4 million people who are poor. 
Nearly 7 million Americans have lost their health insurance. Income for 
the average American family has fallen by over $1,200 since President 
Bush has been President, and some 3 million Americans have lost their 
pensions.

All over this country, from Vermont to California, people get up in 
the morning and they are working incredibly long hours. People need two 
incomes in a family to try to make ends meet. Yet, at the end of the 
day, they are falling further and further behind. There are a lot of 
reasons for that, but I think this bill, and what this bill proposes to 
do, is part of the problem.

During the debate over NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations 
with China, we were told by President Clinton and many others that, 
well, yes, globalization and unfettered free trade, such as our trade 
relations with China, yes, they will cost us blue-collar factory jobs, 
and the result is that because of our trade agreements, we have lost 
millions of good-paying blue-collar factory jobs and, in fact, today 
there are fewer people working in manufacturing than since President 
Kennedy was in office in the early 1960s.

Yes, we have lost millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs, but 
what people told us is: Look, don't worry about that. Yes, we are going 
to lose blue-collar manufacturing jobs, but not to worry because your 
kids are going to become very sophisticated in terms of using 
computers, and the future for them is white-collar information 
technology jobs. We don't need those factory jobs anymore; we have 
white-collar information technology jobs, and those are the kinds of 
jobs which are going to be growing. Unfortunately, that has not quite 
occurred. From January 2001 to January 2006, we lost over 600,000 
information technology jobs.

Alan Blinder, the former Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, has told 
us that between 30 and 40 million jobs in this country are in danger of 
being shipped overseas. In other words, what we are looking at right 
now is not just the loss of blue-collar manufacturing jobs, but we are 
looking at the loss of significant numbers of white-color information 
technology jobs. I know that in my State--and I expect in Senator 
Kennedy's State and all over this country--we have seen white-collar 
information technology jobs heading off to India and other countries. 
There is nothing more painful than to see people in my State--I have 
gone through this experience--having to train people to do their jobs 
as those people return to India.

Some of the leading CEOs and information technology companies have 
told us point blank--this is not a secret--that the new location for 
high-tech jobs is going to be India and China; it is not going to be 
the United States of America.

John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco, has said:




 China will become the IT center of the world, and we can 


 have a healthy discussion about whether that's in 2020 or 


 2040. What we're [in Cisco] trying to do is outline an entire 


 strategy of becoming a Chinese company.


The founder of Intel predicted in the Wall Street Journal that the 
bulk of our information technology jobs will go to China and India over 
the next decade. That is the reality. That is what the heads of the 
information technology industry are telling us.

Over the last few days, a number of us have expressed the concern 
about the impact of bringing low-wage workers into this country and 
what that


would mean to Americans at the lower end of the economic ladder. Today, 
I wish to address a concern I have about what language in this bill 
could do to the middle class and, indeed, the upper middle class, 
people who hold professional jobs and who often earn a very good 
income.

The bill we are discussing today substantially increases the number 
of well-educated professionals coming into the United States from 
overseas. This bill, in fact, would allow 115,000 new professionals to 
come into this country each year, and that number could go up to 
180,000.

This program which allows well-educated professionals to come into 
our country is called the H-1B program. It is currently capped at 
65,000 visas a year. Under the language in this bill, the number would 
increase at least by 50,000 and by as much as 115,000.

The argument that corporate America is using in supporting this 
increase is that there are just not enough highly educated, highly 
skilled Americans to fill available job openings in the high-tech 
industry and in various science fields. Proponents of the H-1B visa 
program also say it allows us to bring in the ''best and the 
brightest'' from around the world to help America's competitiveness 
position. That sounds good on its face, and it may also have the 
benefit of being true in some cases, but there are those in this 
Chamber and across the country who are very concerned that in many 
instances the H-1B program is being used not to supplement American 
high-tech workers when they might be needed but instead is being used 
to replace them with foreign workers who are willing to work for 
substantially lower wages.

First, we should be clear that H-1B visas are not being used only in 
the high-tech and highly specialized technology and science fields. 
That is the argument often made, but it is really not true. The reality 
is that a whole host of jobs in various categories are going to H-1B 
visa holders.

Let's take a look at some of the jobs that corporate America is 
telling us that there are just not enough Americans who are smart 
enough, who are educated enough to perform. Here they are: information 
technology computer professionals--I guess we can't do that kind of 
work; university professors--oh, my word, I guess we just don't have 
enough people to be university professors; engineers, health care 
workers, accountants, financial analysts, management consultants, 
lawyers--lawyers, I love that one. Is there anyone in America who 
doesn't think we have too many lawyers? I guess we need to bring some 
lawyers in as well. Architects, nurses, physicians, surgeons, dentists, 
scientists, journalists and editors, foreign law advisers, 
psychologists, market research analysts, fashion models--Madam 
President, fashion models--teachers in elementary or secondary schools. 
In America, we do not have enough people to become teachers in 
elementary or secondary school. Does anyone really believe that we 
cannot, with proper salary inducements, bring people into secondary and 
primary education?

Given that we all know there are many Americans who have college 
degrees and advanced degrees in these fields who cannot find work, why 
is it that we need to bring in more and more professional workers from 
abroad? For those who believe that the law of supply and demand applies 
to labor costs, the evidence shows there is no shortage of college-
educated workers in America. What we learn in economics 101 is if you 
cannot attract people for certain jobs, you pay them higher wages and 
you give them better benefits. Unfortunately, in America today, from 
2000 to 2004, we have seen the wages of college graduates decline by 5 
percent. So on one hand, corporate America says: Oh, my goodness, we 
can't find people as professionals to fill these jobs, but amazingly 
enough, wages have gone down for college graduates from 2000 to 2004 by 
5 percent. Maybe somebody is not trying hard enough to find American 
workers to fill these jobs.


In truth, what many of us have come to understand is that these H-1B 
visas are not being used to supplement the American workforce where we 
have shortages but, rather, H-1B visas are being used to replace 
American workers with lower cost foreign workers.

There are studies which conclude that H-1B workers earn less than 
what U.S. workers make in similar jobs at similar locations. According 
to the Center for Immigration Studies, wages for H-1B workers average 
$12,000 a year below the median wage for U.S. workers in computer 
fields. Another study by Programmers Guild found that foreign tech 
workers who came to the United States with H-1B visas are paid about 
$25,000 a year less than American workers with the same skill.

According to the GAO:




 Some employers said that they hired H-1B workers in part 


 because these workers would often accept lower salaries than 


 similarly qualified U.S. workers.


What is very important to mention here is that some in corporate 
America are giving the impression that most of the jobs within the H-1B 
program are for highly specialized technical work which just can't be 
found in the United States. The truth is that most of the H-1B visas go 
to people who do not have a Ph.D., who do not have a master's degree, 
but only have a bachelor's degree, a plain old college degree.

In today's Congress Daily, there is a very insightful article on H-1B 
visas which is relevant to this debate:




 As Ron Hira, a professor at Rochester Institute of 


 Technology, points out . . . the Labor Department 


 acknowledges that ''H-1B workers may be hired even when a 


 qualified U.S. worker wants the job, and a U.S. worker can be 


 displaced from the job in favor of a foreign worker.''


The article goes on to state:




 The median wage for new H-1B computing professionals was 


 $50,000 in 2005, far below the median for U.S. computing 


 professionals, according to the annual report of U.S. 


 Citizenship and Immigration Services.


These findings are extremely troubling given the promises made to the 
American people that the future for our economy was with high-skilled, 
high-paying, high-tech jobs. What we have found is that in the last 4 
years, wages for college graduates are going down, and we are finding 
that people from abroad are coming in and doing jobs American 
professionals can do and they are doing them for lower wages.

To bolster their argument for increased H-1B visas, proponents point 
to a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics about the jobs of the 
future. That is what it is entitled, ''Jobs of the Future.'' According 
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over the next decade, 2 million jobs 
will be created in mathematics, engineering, computer science, and 
physical science. That equates to about 200,000 jobs a year times 10--2 
million jobs. Under this legislation, the number of H-1B visas would 
increase to as many as 180,000 a year. That means virtually every job--
about 90 percent--that will be created in the high-tech sector over the 
next 10 years could conceivably be taken by a H-1B visa holder. What 
sense does that make? What are we telling our young people? We are 
saying: Go to college, get the best education you can, and we have all 
kinds of jobs available to you, except those jobs in a significant way 
are going to be taken by people from another country.

We would hope that companies in the United States would have just 
enough patriotism, maybe just a little bit of patriotism so they would 
work to hire qualified American workers. But if you look at the 
statements and conduct of some of these companies, you realize that 
patriotism, love of country is becoming a dated concept for those who 
are pushing extreme globalization.


Let me take one case study, and that is Microsoft. In 2003, 
Microsoft's vice president for Windows engineering was quoted in 
Business Week as saying:




 It is definitely a cultural change to use foreign workers. 


 But if I can save a dollar, hallelujah.


The CEO of Microsoft, Steven Anthony Ballmer, has said, and this is 
an interesting quote, very relevant to today's discussion:




 Lower the pay of U.S. professionals to $50,000, and it 


 won't make sense for employers to put up with the hassle of 


 doing business in developing countries.


In other words, if we lower wages for professionals in this country, 
maybe our companies won't outsource and go to India or China.

The economic benefit of H-1B visas, though, is not limited to 
American companies. The truth is, as my colleagues, Senator Durbin and 
Senator Grassley, have pointed out, the top companies applying for H-1B 
visas are actually outsourcing firms from India, known in the industry 
as ''body shops.'' According to a February 7, 2007, article in 
BusinessWeek:







 Data for the fiscal year 2006, which ended last September, 


 showed that 7 of the top 10 applicants for H-1B visas are 


 Indian companies. Giants Infosys Technologies and Wipro took 


 the top two spots, with 22,600 and 19,400 applications 


 respectively.


In fact, 30 percent of the H-1B visas approved last year went to nine 
Indian outsourcing firms. In other words, the very same companies that 
are involved in the H-1B program of supplying American companies with 
cheap foreign labor are exactly the same corporations that are involved 
in outsourcing, providing cheap labor to these very same companies when 
they move to India. Two sides of the same coin.

In my view, the H-1B system is working against the best interests of 
the American middle class. It is displacing skilled American workers, 
it is lowering our wages, and it is part of the process by which the 
middle class of this country continues to shrink. Meanwhile, it is 
creating huge profits for foreign companies that traffic in H-1B visas.

I do wish to commend Senators Durbin and Grassley for their work to 
reform the H-1B program and their efforts to include in the substitute 
some provisions that strengthen protection for American workers. But as 
important as these strengthened protections are, the H-1B program, 
which will be increased from 65,000 slots to 115,000 slots, and 
potentially even 180,000 slots, continues to pose a threat to American 
jobs and American wages.

The question is: Where do we go from here? What is our response to 
this problem? I could certainly offer an amendment to remove the 
increase in H-1B visas or even to restrict them below the current 
65,000 level. But that amendment would be defeated. So where do we go? 
What is the sensible thing to do? How do we bring people together 
around this issue?

I think the author of the Congress Daily article I referred to 
earlier said it quite well when he wrote:




 More importantly for the American taxpayer, the current 


 allocation system for H-1B visas conveys a valuable 


 resource--access to talented workers who add value to a 


 company's bottom line--at almost no cost. This is a subsidy 


 in violation of market principles for firms that are too 


 quick to appeal to market forces when they are fighting 


 Washington over export controls or other issues.


The amendment I am offering has two goals. First, raising the H-1B 
visa fee from $1,500 to $10,000 will go a long way in telling corporate 
America they are not going to be able to save money by bringing foreign 
professionals into this country, and they may want to look at the 
United States of America to find the workers that they need. If they 
have to pay $10,000, that will cut back on their margin.

Secondly, to the degree it is true that the United States does not 
have a significant number of skilled workers in certain categories--and 
in certain categories that may well be true--this new revenue will be 
dedicated toward providing scholarships to students who are studying in 
areas where we currently lack professionals.

Specifically, my amendment would create a new American Competitive 
Scholarship program at the National Science Foundation that would 
provide merit-based scholarships of up to $15,000 a year, and which are 
renewable for up to 4 years, to students pursuing degrees in math, 
science, engineering, medicine, nursing, other health care fields, and 
other extremely important fields vital to the competitiveness of this 
Nation. These new scholarships would create the incentive for the best 
and the brightest of American students to enter these fields where 
there is reputedly a shortage.


In other words, we have the absurd situation today where we are 
bringing people from all over the world into this country to do this 
job, yet we have large numbers of middle-class, working-class families 
who can't afford to send their kids to college or to graduate school. 
Well, maybe we ought to pay attention to American workers and American 
families first.

How will this program be paid for? Under current law, companies 
applying for H-1B visas pay a $1,500 fee. That fee is split up in a 
number of ways, with some of it going to scholarships and retraining 
programs. Unfortunately, it is too small to effectively create a 
scholarship program of the scale needed to address the claimed shortage 
in math, science, and technology specialists. This amendment imposes an 
$8,500 surcharge on those companies seeking H-1B visas. This fee would 
only apply to those who are required to pay the current $1,500 fee. 
Therefore, universities and schools would be exempt, as they are under 
current law. Companies with less than 25 employees would pay only half 
the fee.

I am sure corporate America will tell us this $8,500 fee is too 
expensive; that they can't afford it. After all, many of these people 
are the same exact people who opposed raising the minimum wage above 
$5.15 an hour. However, this fee represents a very small amount 
compared to the incredible economic benefits that companies realize 
from bringing in foreign H-1B visa workers.

H-1B visas are valid for 3 years. So the $8,500 surcharge on an 
annual basis is only $2,800. Compared to the median $50,000 wage of a 
new H-1B computing professional, it is only about 5.5 percent of that 
wage. For this small fee, what would be the benefit to American 
students and our families? If there are 115,000 H-1B visas issued for 
which fees are paid, we could provide over 65,000 scholarships each 
year to our students--65,000. If the number of H-1B visas goes to 
180,000, we could provide scholarships to over 100,000 American 
students.

If the Members of this body believe we need H-1B visas to compensate 
for a shortage of skilled American professionals, this amendment will 
attract tens of thousands of America's best and brightest to those 
fields.

One of the reasons I am offering this amendment, which will provide 
much needed scholarships for the American middle class, is I was very 
interested in reading an article that appeared in BusinessWeek on April 
19, 2004. In that article, BusinessWeek reported that:




 To win favor in China, Microsoft has pledged to spend more 


 than $750 million on cooperative research, technology for 


 schools, and other investments.


If Microsoft and other corporations have billions of dollars to 
invest in technology for schools, research, and other needs in China 
and other countries, these same companies should have enough money to 
provide scholarships for middle-class kids in the United States of 
America.

Another major supporter of the H-1B program is IBM. Last year, IBM 
made $9.5 billion in profits. Meanwhile, IBM has announced it will be 
investing $6 billion in India by 2009 and--get this--IBM has also 
signed deals to train 100,000 software specialists. Where? In 
Massachusetts? In Vermont? In California? No, in China, according to an 
August 4, 2003, article in BusinessWeek.

Other major supporters of increasing H-1B workers include Intel, 
which made $5 billion in profits last year; Bank of America, 
Caterpillar, General Electric, Boeing, and Lehman Brothers. All of 
these companies, making billions and billions of dollars in profit, 
can't afford to pay American workers the wages they need. Well, if they 
can't do that, at least let them contribute to an important scholarship 
program.

Let me conclude by saying a vote for this amendment is a vote for 
preserving American competitiveness in the 21st century, it is a vote 
for giving our children a brighter future, and it is a vote--
unfortunately all too rare--to help middle-income families in this 
country who are struggling so hard to make sure their kids can have the 
education they need.

Madam President, I am not quite sure of the proper legislative 
approach, but on this amendment, I will be calling for the yeas and 
nays.
