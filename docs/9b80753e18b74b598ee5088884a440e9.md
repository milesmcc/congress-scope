Mr. McNERNEY. Today it gives me great pleasure to rise in honor of 
Staff Sergeant Michael Broussard of Contra Costa County's own 
Brentwood, California, for winning the 25th Best Ranger Competition, 
one of the Army's athletic achievements.

Held at Fort Benning, Georgia, the competition tests a Ranger's 
physical and mental toughness and self-discipline. Of the 28 
participants, only 16 were able to complete the grueling 3-day athletic 
competition, which features some of the best athletes in the world.

Despite this honor, I believe Staff Sergeant Broussard's greatest 
achievement is that he repeatedly served this Nation with distinction 
by completing two deployments to Iraq and two deployments to 
Afghanistan.

Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Broussard is a true American hero and an 
example of the commitment, dedication, and capability of our men and 
women in uniform on and off the battlefield.
