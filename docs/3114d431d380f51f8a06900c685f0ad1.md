Mr. ISRAEL. Well, I thank the gentleman. I think it is a very sound 
idea. The Iraq Study Group proved its value as an independent entity. 
And I have the highest regard for General Petraeus. In fact, he was in 
my office the day that the President announced the surge. And I was 
skeptical about the surge, personally I did not support the surge, but 
I thought it was important to reach out to General Petraeus and at 
least give him an opportunity to explain it to me.

I think he is the best we have. I have a very high regard for him. I 
think his report is going to be indispensable. I think it would be 
extremely useful to send the Iraqi Study Group back to take a look so 
that, like President Reagan said, ''trust but verify.'' I think that 
verification would be extremely useful.

And I will yield to the gentleman from New York.
