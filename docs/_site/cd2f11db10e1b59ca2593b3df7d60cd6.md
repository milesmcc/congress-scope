Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, the subject of Iraq and the 
war in Iraq, the global war on terror, is indeed a subject that is a 
tense subject, it is a difficult subject. In districts like mine, with 
Fort Campbell, with our National Guard men and women, it is one that we 
talk about a lot.

Mr. Speaker, one of the things that I do fear is that in this debate, 
as we talk about it, we have lost civility in this debate. It has been 
of great concern to me that I have heard of some of the actions of the 
protesters who came to our Nation's capital this weekend. I am deeply 
disturbed by the report of a veteran who was counterprotesting the 
protesters that were here, and he was spat upon by those protesters, 
spat upon, a man who fought for our freedom, to protect the freedom 
that allows them to have a protest. That is shameful, and they should 
be ashamed; they should be dealt with.

You know, one of the things that we continue to hear from the Iraqis 
is, do not leave us until we are stable. That, Mr. Speaker, is 
something that we need to remember. It is imperative that we make 
certain that they move to stability and productivity.
