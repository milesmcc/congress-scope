Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator from Virginia, and I know this is 
not following the exact process of our Senate rules, but I would ask 
him if he would address a point I made earlier; that the authorization 
for the use of force which President George W. Bush brought before us 
in October 2002 was explicit in the reasons for our invasion of Iraq--
the threat of Saddam Hussein, the threat of weapons of mass 
destruction, and any threat of that nation to the security of the 
United States. Does the Senator from Virginia believe that 
authorization of the use of force applies to the current circumstance 
in Iraq today?
