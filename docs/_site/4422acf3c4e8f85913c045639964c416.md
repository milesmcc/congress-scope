Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the gentlewoman 
from California for her leadership in overseeing this Out of Iraq task 
force. Clearly, the work that this task force has done had an impact on 
the elections of 2006 and continues to have an impact as we go down the 
line.

I want to be very brief. Last night, I went home and I turned on the 
President's speech; and as a good American, I wanted him to convince me 
that there was reason to send 21,000 young men and women back into 
Iraq. See, as a young Congresswoman, this is my 8th year, I have 
attended five funerals: a young man 19, another young man 28, another 
young man 28, another one 40-something, and another one in his 30s.

And I sat there and I looked into the faces of those mothers, 
fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, spouses and children; and it 
was hard for me to come up with words to explain to them why their 
family members had died.

We can talk about how they paid the ultimate price; but I wanted to 
say to them, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to let their deaths 
be just another number in this 2,000, 3,000 young men and women we have 
lost. So I waited last night for President Bush to tell me something, 
give me an indication, say, Stephanie, this is why we need to send 
21,000 more people; and I never got it. I never, ever got it. So it is 
hard for me to explain to my constituency that we ought to send 21,000 
more people.

So I come to the floor once again this evening to say to Ms. Waters 
and all the rest of my colleagues in the Out of Iraq conference, it is 
the same old song with a different meaning. Same beat, same old song 
over and over again. It is time to come out of Iraq.
