Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, this week the House will once again 
take up an Iraq emergency funding bill which is seriously flawed and 
should be rejected.

Having 535 politicians attempt to micromanage the war on terror from 
atop Capitol Hill is a recipe for disaster. This Congress should not be 
telegraphing our war strategy to the enemy and setting arbitrary 
timetables for withdrawal, nor should we be tying the hands of our 
Commander in Chief and military leaders on the ground.

Iraq has become a central battlefield on the war on terror, not 
because we say so, but because the terrorists themselves have declared 
Iraq to be the central front for their global jihad. Therefore, it is 
vital that we win the war and achieve success in Iraq. To do so, this 
Congress must reject efforts to micromanage the war and give the Iraqi 
new strategy opportunity to succeed.
