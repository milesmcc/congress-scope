Mr. SKELTON. Some things are hard to understand. I think this is a 
very bad idea. By adopting this amendment, we are sending a message to 
the Iraqi people that we are there forever. We are sending a message to 
the American people we are going to be in Iraq forever. And what we are 
doing there is, at the end of the day, trying to create trust among the 
Iraqi people, and this is a major step backwards.

The President has not affirmed one way or the other on this, and I 
think we in Congress should strongly say that we are not there 
permanently, that we are there to bring stability, that we are there to 
encourage the representative government that is struggling along; but 
we are not there as a permanent resident either on a base or otherwise. 
And this is a message amendment that is to the Iraqi people and to the 
American people, and it is just a downright unclear and bad idea.

I yield 1 minute to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
Andrews).

(Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
