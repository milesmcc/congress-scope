`Mr. BROWN â€” 11 December 2009`

---


Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to honor 1stSgt Bradley G. Simmons, 
U.S. Marine Corps, for his year of service to the U.S. Senate and for 
his continuing service to our Nation and the Marine Corps.

For the past year, lstSgt Bradley Simmons has worked in my office and 
served the people of Ohio as the first enlisted Marine fellow in the 
U.S. Senate.

Before joining the Senate, lstSgt Bradley Simmons served in Kuwait 
with the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion. He also participated in the 
initial attack and continuing operations in Iraq.

His heroic service as an AAV section leader during that time earned 
him the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and a combat 
distinguishing device for valor.

1stSgt Bradley Simmons' strength, dedication, and firsthand 
experience overseas made him an invaluable resource for my staff and 
our Nation's service members and veterans.

Understanding of the difficult transition for returning service 
members and veterans, lstSgt Bradley Simmons reached out to help them 
and their families in tangible ways.

From helping Ohio veterans with their VA claims; to assisting a 
wounded service member during rehabilitation; to meeting and speaking 
with the families whose loved ones are overseas, lst Sgt Bradley 
Simmons demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to his fellow service 
members.

His tireless work on the Visions Scholars Act of 2009 will help 
ensure that veterans suffering from eye injuries would not also suffer 
from the current nationwide shortage of visions specialists at the VA.

The Vision Scholars Act of 2009 passed the Senate last month with 
great assistance from Sergeant Simmons.

But lstSgt Bradley Simmons has been more than a trusted adviser.

He's been a teacher and a friend. As First Sergeant Simmons likes to 
say, he has been running a full-scale Marine Corps familiarization 
program in my office for the past year.

With a story-telling talent that left you laughing, with a moment of 
contemplation on the life of a marine, or with a little PT 
encouragement for the deskbound, First Sergeant Simmons made us 
appreciate the leadership qualities that are found throughout the ranks 
of the Marine Corps, but especially in him.

From interns in my office to constituents in the State, to all of my 
staff in Ohio and Washington, he succeeded in educating us about the 
honor, tradition, and sacrifices readily made by our Marines and our 
military forces.

He made us better at our jobs and better citizens in our communities.

He accompanied me to Walter Reed to visit troops recovering from 
combat injuries and later assisted in helping a few of them transition 
to life as a civilian, or on active duty in the guard or reserve.

He invited my staff to the Pentagon to a welcome home those recently 
injured in Iraq and Afghanistan.

During this past year, First Sergeant Simmons taught us about the 
determination and commitment of the men and women who give honor to the 
Marine Corps.

A lot has changed in the past year for our office, and for lstSgt 
Bradley Simmons as well. First Sergeant Simmons came to my office as a 
gunnery sergeant.

At his promotion ceremony a few weeks back, his superiors explained 
that the Marine Corps does not base promotion in rank on previous 
performance and accomplishment.

Instead, promotion is based on a candidate's innate capability and 
potential to do the job well and the rank of first sergeant justice.

Like his superiors, I am as confident that he will succeed in 
anything he attempts and that he demonstrates the courage and 
commitment that we recognize in him.

His humility belies his dedicated service to our Nation. It provides 
great comfort knowing that hundreds of marines will have the 
opportunity to work, live, learn, and serve with First Sergeant 
Simmons.

He is a testament to the Marines, to our Nation, to his family, and 
to his home State of Kansas.

And to Karen, his wife, thank you for your support and sacrifice 
while your husband serves this Nation. I enjoyed meeting you and I know 
that lstSgt Bradley Simmons can do what he does because of your love 
and support.

After having the privilege of working with First Sergeant Simmons 
over the past year and seeing the lasting mark he has left on my 
office, I am honored to have someone of his caliber and commitment 
representing our Nation.

Thank you, 1stSgt Bradley G. Simmons, for your distinguished service 
to the people of Ohio and for your continued commitment to protecting 
our Nation and the prosperity of all Americans.
