Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, last November Democrats listened to the 
American people. But, unfortunately, President Bush continues to ignore 
them. Democrats promised to take our Nation in a new direction, and in 
many ways we have. We increased the minimum wage for the first time in 
a decade. We made Americans safer by fully implementing the 9/11 
Commission recommendations. We also restored PAYGO rules so that 
Congress lives within its means.

We are proud of our accomplishments, but an intransigent President is 
blocking our efforts to do more. Lifesaving cures to debilitating 
diseases remain out of reach because President Bush vetoed stem cell 
research legislation. Our soldiers continue to referee a civil war in 
Iraq because President Bush vetoed a bill that would have brought our 
troops home next year. And millions of children cannot see the doctor 
of their choice because President Bush vetoed bipartisan legislation 
that would provide health insurance to 4 million more kids.

Madam Speaker, while it is frustrating to deal with a President who 
continues to ignore the results of last year's elections, congressional 
Democrats will continue to move America in a new direction.
