Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may 
consume because I'd like to comment on a point that was raised by my 
good friend from Indiana (Mr. Burton) regarding the intentions of Iran.

The deputy interior minister for security affairs and the former 
deputy head of the Revolutionary Guards in Iran said on April 26 of 
this year, ''Iran has long-range missiles that can make nowhere safe 
for America.''

He also said, ''Iran is able to fire tens of thousands of missiles 
per day at American targets on a daily basis and, with its long-range 
missiles, can threaten Israel which is acting as America's'' proxy.

So it is clear to us, Mr. Speaker, that Iran seeks not just to wipe 
Israel off the map, as Ahmadinejad has said time and again, but to 
destroy the United States. So is the plan to immediately leave Iraq so 
that Iran can begin its takeover of the region? Is this in the national 
security interests of the United States? Is that going to make us 
safer?

I think that we should carefully consider what will happen were we to 
withdraw immediately as, it has been called for.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.
