`Mr. CONAWAY â€” 19 March 2007`

---


Mr. CONAWAY. If the gentleman will yield back. We don't know for 
sure. I know that, during the debate last week, the chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee could not confirm his instructions from his 
leadership as to what he should be doing. In other words, were we going 
to have an open rule, as has been the tradition. Well beyond the 12 
years' takeover that the Republican's experienced, it has just been a 
tradition on each floor that we bring an appropriations bill to the 
floor with open rules. And as late as last week, the chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee, a guy that you would think would be in the 
know, would be in the inner circle, in the inside skinny with respect 
to the Democrat leadership, even he didn't know what the Speaker had 
decided in this arena.

So the caveats placed in there, the restrictions on our ability to 
fight this fight, the instructions to the President, I want to speak at 
from a little different angle. You yourself talked about the advantages 
that gives our enemies if we have a date certain that we have to be out 
of Iraq. That is pretty obvious. It doesn't take a lot of common sense, 
it doesn't take a lot of warfighting experience to understand that if 
you give your enemy that kind of an advance notice, that that is a 
clear advantage to the enemy.


I want to look at it from the other side. I want to look at it from 
the side of our troops. How do we ask good men and women who defend 
this country with their lives to fight under those considerations?

One of the great lines that the other side has used to argue about 
the war is, well, if we would have just known in 2002 what we know 
today, we would have voted differently. Well, yeah. Right. Well, let me 
maybe take a bit of a twist on that. How do we face that mom and dad in 
March of 2008 whose son or daughter has been maimed or killed? How do 
we look them in the eye and say, yeah, you know, if we had known in 
March of 2007, when we were setting the arbitrary and artificial dates, 
that your son was going to get killed in March of 2008, gee, we would 
have set the date at March 28 or January 31.

And so what we are doing to our troops is that we are undermining 
their morale, their strength of purpose by asking them to do things 
that are just unbelievably untenable. Night after night after night we 
listen to these floor speeches and we hear people build a case that in 
their mind we need to get out. We have had a couple earlier tonight, in 
fact, Mr. Speaker, that went through a litany of information they have 
used, they have gleaned to make their decision that we have lost this 
fight and that we need to get out.

Well, this body, from time to time, like daily, has its integrity 
challenged. Each one of us has a challenge to our integrity all the 
time; whether it is from a campaign contribution that we got and they 
are trying to link it to some sort of official act, all those integrity 
issues play out in the media constantly, and we rarely get our day in 
court. We rarely have an opportunity to stand tall and vote our 
conscience. I am going to argue, Mr. Speaker, that the Out of Iraq 
Caucus and all those other Members who have come in here night after 
night after night saying we have got to get out of Iraq have got an 
opportunity to vote their conscience this week.

I will argue, Mr. Speaker, that there are only two legitimate 
positions with respect to what we are doing in Iraq. The first, that I 
agree with, is to fight this fight and win it. The other legitimate 
circumstance is to get out today. There is no half ground. There is no 
half-stepping it. There is no run up the white flag and retreat the way 
that this supplemental would argue. There are no other choices but to 
fight the fight or get out.

And so all of these colleagues of ours that have night after night 
after night preached about getting out of Iraq have got an opportunity 
to demonstrate their integrity to their convictions. We will see how 
they vote. Will they vote the party line, come down here, 233 of them 
strong, vote in favor of this supplemental with these restrictions on


them that are unworkable in the extreme, but that put our men and women 
in harm, that make it very difficult for our combat leaders?

Our good colleague tonight is an experienced pilot in the Airborne. 
How do you ask a sergeant, how do you ask a first lieutenant to go do a 
dangerous mission in the last half of March of 2008, knowing that by 
the end of the month we are getting out of there? And how do you ask 
people to do that? You simply can't. You can't ask people to do that. 
You can't ask people to put their lives on the line under that kind of 
a restriction.
