Mr. NEAL. Thank you for yielding, Mr. Chairman.

Some of the best speeches that I have ever listened to and/or read 
come from the legendary mayor of Boston, James Michael Curley. And 
Curley spoke with great empathy about the forgotten man, those 
individuals who for whatever reason have found themselves outside of 
the mainstream of economic life. He also would suggest that, in 
simplicity, that the great ally of civilization was a full stomach. And 
we need to be reminded of that with the grim economic statistics that 
America is currently witnessing.

Now, also another very pertinent reminder here that I think that we 
all ought to recall: in October of 2008, in record time this House 
voted to come to the aid of Wall Street. It didn't take us long, with 
the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to keep standing many of those 
institutions that helped create the problem that we find ourselves 
currently in.

Now, why is that relevant? There are millions of people across this 
country who have simply found themselves without work. What does that 
do to an individual who has spent a career, and after 30 years finds 
the job is gone? And we treat them as though they are simply a 
statistic after perhaps they served us in an honorable manner in 
Vietnam, or currently in Iraq, or Afghanistan, or other theaters around 
the world?

America's about building community, Madam Speaker. America's about a 
place where nobody's to be abandoned and nobody's to be left behind. 
The great bounty of God's work has been to ensure that most people in 
America have shelter and food. This opportunity to extend unemployment 
benefits for the American people ought to meet this moment.
