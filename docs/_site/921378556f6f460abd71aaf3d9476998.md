Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for 
yielding me this time.

I rise today to express my strong support for S. 1963, the Caregivers 
and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009. Chairman Filner and 
Chairman Michaud, along with Ranking Member Buyer and I have brought 
this legislation forward in order to continue the great progress made 
by the VA toward providing the kind of health care veterans deserve, 
and I am proud to support it today.

I think it's pretty evident, as the Speaker alluded to earlier, that 
in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which I have had the privilege 
to serve now 10 years, we always leave our bipartisanship at the door 
when we enter that committee, and I am grateful that Mr. Filner also 
continued in that same spirit when he became the chairman.

At a time when our soldiers are overseas keeping us safe here at 
home, the VA is faced with a number of unique challenges. It must 
respond to the signature wounds of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to 
soldiers returning home who live far from VA facilities, to the ever-
increasing number of women veterans, and to the families of veterans 
who cannot care for themselves, but it must also remain responsive to 
those whom it already serves. I believe this bill would accomplish 
this.

When soldiers return home from war, unable to care for themselves, 
their families often face difficult burdens. To help them help the 
veterans, this bill would establish a comprehensive assistance program 
for caregivers, making caregivers eligible to receive education and 
training and technical support, counseling, lodging and subsistence.

To serve the rural veterans, who may live a long distance from VA 
facilities, this bill would make the VA more flexible while increasing 
reach-out efforts. The VA would be allowed to partner with Medicare, 
Medicaid, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Indian 
Health Service in demonstration projects that could expand care.

Finally, two of the most common wounds of war in Iraq and Afghanistan 
have been post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. By 
expanding eligibility for readjustment counseling at Vet Centers to any 
members of the Armed Forces who have served in OIF/OEF and establishing 
the Committee on Care for Veterans with TBI, the VA will become more 
responsive to those who are transitioning back to civilian life.

In closing, I want to thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer 
of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and Chairman Michaud of the Health 
Subcommittee, for their leadership in bringing this bill forward.

I urge my colleagues to stand up for America's true heroes and help 
continue to make the VA world class care even better.
