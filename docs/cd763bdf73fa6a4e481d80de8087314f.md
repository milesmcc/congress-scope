Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the students of 
Half Hollow Hills High School East for their thoughtful letters on the 
war in Iraq. I appreciated hearing their views and reading their 
individual letters which contained their ideas and perspectives on our 
involvement in Iraq.

I want to applaud their interest in this critical topic and 
appreciate that they took the time to share their opinions with me.
