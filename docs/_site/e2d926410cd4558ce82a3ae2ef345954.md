Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, pursuant to the 
Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the 
following information regarding earmarks I received as part of H.R. 
2647--National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.

I requested one project in H.R. 2647.

In coordination with thirteen other Members of Congress, I sent a 
letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member requesting support for 
additional funding for the Army National Guard's H60 Black Hawk 
Helicopter modernization program. As a result of this letter, $20.4 
million was included in the Defense Authorization Act for this purpose. 
Army National Guard operational tempos are the highest they have ever 
been supporting the full spectrum of state missions including search 
and rescue, utility/lift, disaster relief, firefighting, medical 
evacuation, all while sustaining deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan and 
the Balkans. This high operational tempo is wearing out the National 
Guard H60 fleet much faster than planned and as a result of this 
request, we can ensure the National Guard has the tools and equipment 
they need to do their job.
