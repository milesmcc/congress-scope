Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would also add to the remarks I just made.

In addition to what I outlined earlier, look at what we have done on 
Iraq. We forced the President to debate this issue, to talk to us about 
this issue. The Republicans had to debate us. This war went on for 
years, and there wasn't even a congressional oversight hearing held. We 
have held hearings, and they have been opened up to this country. We 
helped uncover the scandal of Walter Reed, just to mention a few of the 
things we have done on Iraq, plus forcing on the President money to get 
body armor for the troops so the parents no longer had to buy them and 
up-armoring of vehicles we have forced upon the President.
