Ms. SUTTON. Thank you, Representative Arcuri. That firsthand account 
and your observations are very enlightening. We appreciate you bringing 
them forward and, again, highlighting the fact that as we make this 
choice and as the President opts to try and keep us in Iraq for 10 
years, or beyond, it means there are other consequences. Beyond all of 
those other consequences we talked about militarily and the effects on 
our military, there are those domestic issues, Representative Shea-
Porter, that you point out and Mr. Arcuri points out that we will 
continue to fall behind on. I think that the picture is becoming a 
little bit more clear down here tonight that we need some comprehensive 
thinking that is smart and effective. And the question of a responsible 
redeployment and what that plan should look like is really the one that 
we need to be working on.

With that, I want to pass it over to another great Member of the new 
Congress, a freshman from Minnesota who I think is going to shed some 
light on the Blackwater situation.
