Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since we have a lull in the conversation 
about the technical corrections bill--and the reason for that is, 
frankly, it is a very straightforward bill. We know of two other 
amendments. We are working with Senator Coburn on his amendment dealing 
with an investigation into what occurred in the Coconut Road project in 
Florida. We know Senator Bond has an amendment which is really not a 
technical correction. It goes to overturning a law that was passed 
which protects consumers when they are defrauded by furniture moving 
companies. That is his amendment. We hope he can come down here so we 
can get going; we can start to debate that.


But in the meantime, I have asked Senator Inhofe if he had any 
objection if I rose to pay tribute to 19 young Americans who were 
killed in Iraq who were either from California or based in California, 
and he had no objection to that. I don't know if I need to ask to speak 
as in morning business. If that is the appropriate thing, I ask 
unanimous consent to do so.
