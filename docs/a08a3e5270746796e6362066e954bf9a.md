Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, this Congress remains committed to 
forging a new direction in Iraq. Overwhelmingly, the American people 
support our plan to establish important benchmarks and a responsible 
timetable to redeploy the troops.

Yet, the President has threatened to veto our legislation, even 
though it ensures our troops have everything they need, and for our 
veterans when they return home. However, just last week, Defense 
Secretary Robert Gates said, and I quote: The debate in Congress has 
been helpful in demonstrating to the Iraqis that American patience is 
limited.

Mr. Gates went on to say that the strong feelings expressed in the 
Congress about the timetable probably has had a positive impact on 
communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment. 
To ensure that the Iraqis step up and take control of their own 
country, we must continue to demonstrate that the American people will 
not stand for an open-ended commitment of American resources or 
personnel.
