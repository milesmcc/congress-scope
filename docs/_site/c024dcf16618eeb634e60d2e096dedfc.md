`Mr. ALTMIRE â€” 25 April 2007`

---


Mr. ALTMIRE. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding.

I want to talk about what these charts mean that the gentleman from 
New Hampshire is holding up next to where he is speaking. These are 
examples of generals, people who have seen firsthand what is happening 
on the ground in Afghanistan, people with the utmost military 
experience, who have said clearly, without ambiguity, that the 
President's course of action is wrong. And the course of action that we 
took today here in this House is endorsed by these generals. And this 
is a further example of the President's not listening to anybody but 
himself and his very, very close circle of advisers, any of whom, if 
they differ from him, find themselves reassigned or out on the street. 
And for some reason, the President doesn't listen to his generals. He 
doesn't listen to the Iraq Study Group.

You will recall, and I would like to remind my colleagues, that he 
said, when the Iraq Study Group formed and was going about their 
business of studying this situation and coming up with their report, 
that he was going to pay attention to what they said and take some of 
their advice. Well, unfortunately, the report came out and was promptly 
discarded by the administration, and they did nothing about what was in 
the Iraq Study Group.

Now, some of the things that were talked about that we should engage 
in diplomacy with countries like Iran and Syria, we know where the 
President stands on that. He is not going to change with that. The Iraq 
Study Group recommended that we do set a timeline on our activities to 
increase our leverage with the Iraqi Government, as I talked about 
earlier. But the President chose to discard that. He chose to discard 
what his generals on the ground said. Those that disagreed were 
reassigned, and some of them now, as Mr. Hodes has pointed out, are 
saying that what we are doing is the right course of action. But what 
is most important and what is most relevant for what we did today in 
this House, the President is ignoring the American people.

We have all seen the polls about where the American public feels 
about this. But we shouldn't legislate by polls; we should legislate 
based on we are elected Representatives of the American people. There 
are 435 districts in this House, each of whom has a voice, and it is 
our responsibility as Representatives to go back into our districts, 
listen to what our constituents have to say on these issues of critical 
importance, return here on a day like today, debate the issue the 
entire day, come back at 11 o'clock at night and we are still debating 
the issue. But we took a vote and we had to put it on the line, yes or 
no, where do you come down on this issue? The Congress has spoken. At 
least the House has spoken. The Senate is going to speak in the next 
day or two.

And I want to make one thing clear. Let there be there be no 
discussion about this. If the Senate passes the conference report, 
which we expect, and sends this bill to the President, as Mr. Hodes 
said, he has a decision to make. He can either sign that bill and 
provide the troops the funding that they need to continue the mission, 
or veto the bill and deny them the support that they need. That is his 
choice. The Congress has spoken on that.

So when any Member of this House has one of their constituents come 
up to them and say, well, when are you going to give our troops the 
money that they need to continue this fight? Well, we did it today. The 
answer to that question is we did it today. The Senate is going to do 
it tomorrow, perhaps the following day.

Then the President has a decision to make. And if he chooses to veto 
that bill, the troops' funding will be delayed. But that won't be 
because of us. That will be because of a decision that was made down 
the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
