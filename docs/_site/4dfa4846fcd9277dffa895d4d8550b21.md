Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. I am going to thank my friend, my colleague, 
Chairman Lantos, for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. This resolution is 
not a panacea. It will not get us out of Iraq tomorrow, next week or 
next month, but it is a step that will bring an end to this madness.

Our President, the commander in chief, told us a few days ago, that 
the surge is just beginning when he deployed more troops 6 months ago. 
He asked Members of Congress to wait. He is telling the American people 
to be patient.

We cannot wait. We cannot be patient. The American people want an end 
to this war and end it now.

How many more of our young people must die before we realize enough 
is enough? One more day of involvement is too many. One more death is 
one too many. This war is not worthy of another drop of human blood.

It is leaving a stain on the moral fabric of this Nation and 
destroying our credibility in the community of nations. We will never 
find the answer to Iraq down the barrel of a gun or in the warhead of a 
missile.

Vote for this resolution and bring this war to an end and bring it to 
an end now.
