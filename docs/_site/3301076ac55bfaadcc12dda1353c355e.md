Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill as it passed 
committee, and in particular of the Sea Power and Expeditionary Forces 
section of the bill.

Under the leadership of Chairman Ike Skelton, the fleet has grown by 
seven ships since he became chairman to a total of 286. I guess it's in 
the direction, however slowly, of the 313 ships that CNO wishes to 
have. It also takes some far-reaching steps, one of which is directing 
the CNO that in the future, that in order to go to the fleet, he may 
only retire two ships for every three ships we commission. I think this 
is very important language. This is the third CNO who has said he 
wanted 313 ships, but ironically, they keep submitting budgets to 
Congress that actually shrink their fleet rather than grow it.

So I want to thank Chairman Skelton for working with us on that, my 
colleagues, on directive language that actually keeps some of those 
great vessels that would go to someone else's fleet in our fleet a bit 
longer.

Specifically the bill takes many steps to continue the work of the 
world's greatest Navy and the world's greatest Marine Corps. It 
authorizes the construction of nine battle-force vessels and one 
auxiliary oceanographic research vessel, along with 214 aircraft for 
the Navy and Marine Corps. It authorizes $5.1 billion to construct two 
Virginia-class submarines--the first time Congress has ever authorized 
two Virginia-class submarines; $950 million for the first increment of 
funding of the Marine Corp's amphibious assault vessel LHA-7; $3 
billion to fully fund two DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers to work 
off of the Navy's surface fleet and the centerpiece of our Nation's 
missile defense; $1.5 billion to fully fund two littoral combat ships; 
$180.7 million to fund one Joint High Speed Vessel for the Navy; $380 
million to fully fund the remaining construction costs for the first of 
the class maritime landing platform vessel for the Marine Corps; $3.3 
billion for 30 F-18 Superhornet strike fighters, as well as 12 EA-18 
Growler expeditionary electronic-warfare aircraft.

That will make a total of 186 of these fine aircraft built on 
Chairman Skelton's watch. $4.1 billion for 20 Navy and Marine Corps F-
35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft; $4.6 billion for 180 Marine Corps 
rotary-winged aircraft; $359 million for the Maritime Administration of 
the Department of Transportation, including $100 million for the 
Merchant Marine Academy.

The bill strongly supports funding for our Overseas Contingency 
Operations, authorizing $3.4 billion to build the life saving Mine 
Resistant Vehicles. This is on top of the $16.4 billion under Chairman 
Skelton's watch that was allocated in 2007 for a total of 16,000 of 
these vehicles that have been built as we continue to build 1,000 of 
them a month to protect our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.

For Marine Corps programs, this bill fully authorizes the $3.1 
billion for a request for Marine Corps procurement, with an additional 
$126 million for unfunded requirements that will protect our Marines.

Mr. Chairman, I fully support the bill as recommended by the 
committee.
