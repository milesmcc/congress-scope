Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of my 
constituents, LCpl Jered Campbell.

Lance Corporal Campbell recently returned from Haditha, Iraq, where 
he served a 7-month deployment. He was assigned to Company ''E'' of the 
Second Battalion, Third Marine Regiment of the United States Marine 
Corps.

The city of Haditha saw unprecedented improvements where Lance 
Corporal Campbell's Company E served. Upon arrival, Haditha was 
considered one of the most dangerous regions in Iraq. By the end of 
Lance Corporal Campbell's deployment, the police force was rapidly 
growing, attacks on Iraqi police and Marine patrols were steadily 
decreasing, and relations with the Iraqi people were improving.

Madam Speaker, please join me in paying tribute to Lance Corporal 
Campbell, whose selfless actions benefit all Americans. Our Nation owes 
Lance Corporal Campbell and his fellow Marines a great debt of 
gratitude for their service.
