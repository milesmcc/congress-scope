Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I 
may consume and am prepared to yield back as we have no further 
speakers.

Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. We agree on a bipartisan 
basis that when a corrupt contractor overbills our U.S. military, it 
rips off the taxpayers, it hurts our national security, and it unfairly 
stains the reputation of the many honorable military and civilian 
contractors who risk their lives every day and do a professional and 
honest job.



This bill appropriately says that if you plan on overbilling or 
ripping off the U.S. military in terms of these contracts to do 
reconstruction work or military-related work in Iraq or Afghanistan, 
you are going to be sitting in a prison cell for 20 years and you are 
going to pay a fine of $1 million. We think that is an appropriate 
message to accept in light of this problem. And I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote ''yes'' on H.R. 400.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
