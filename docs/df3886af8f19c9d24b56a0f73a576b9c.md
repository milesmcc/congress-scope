# UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS

`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of course, I will object. This is right 
back where we were a week ago. As the distinguished majority leader and 
the distinguished majority whip have said on numerous occasions in the 
last couple of years, the Senate is not the House. Senate Republicans 
are going to insist on fair treatment on the most important issue on 
the minds of the American people today; that is, the war in Iraq. The 
Senate simply cannot--and I have heard Senator Byrd make these points 
on numerous occasions--cannot operate this way. The Senate Republicans 
insist on one or more amendments on the most important issue 
confronting our country--the war in Iraq.

What I had hoped was that the distinguished majority leader and 
myself would be able to work out a consent agreement that would allow 
us to have--he would pick his amendment, and it is apparent the 
amendment the majority would like to have is the House-passed 
concurrent resolution, and then there would be an alternative, at least 
one alternative. Many of my Members would like to have more than one 
alternative in this extremely important debate, but at least one 
alternative on this side of the choosing of the majority of 
Republicans. So, therefore, I object.
