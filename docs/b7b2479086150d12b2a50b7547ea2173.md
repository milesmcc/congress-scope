Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in terms of the process by which we go 
forward next week to discuss the Iraq situation, as the majority leader 
indicated, we have been in discussions over the last couple of days 
about how that might go forward. We are still in the process of 
consulting with our Members. I have indicated to the majority leader 
that there is likely to be one or more additional resolutions offered 
by this side, and as we begin the week, I will have a clearer picture 
of just how many that might be, and then we can begin to sit down and 
structure the process by which those will be considered in the Senate. 
I look forward to working with the majority leader next week in that 
regard.
