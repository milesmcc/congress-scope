Mr. PENCE. I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, and I 
thank him for his leadership on this and so many other issues affecting 
our national defense throughout his career in Congress.

I rise in opposition to this supplemental bill because, simply put, 
it is fiscally irresponsible and constitutionally flawed.

Mr. Speaker, emergency war spending bills should be about emergency 
war spending. This bill, with $124 billion in spending, only includes 
$111 billion in spending that is actually related to the war on terror 
in Afghanistan and in Iraq.

Thirteen billion dollars in this legislation will be spent on 
unrelated domestic spending; $25 million for spinach, $125 million for 
shrimp, $75 million for peanuts, $5 million for shellfish. That is not 
a war spending bill, that is the salad bar at Denny's.

Mr. Speaker, we all know that with the deadlines for withdrawal, 
retreat and defeat, this bill is constitutionally flawed. Congress can 
declare war. Congress can choose to fund or choose not to fund military 
operations. But from the very inception of this Nation, no truth has 
been more evident, Congress cannot conduct war. In fact, the fear of 
war by committee was debated and rejected in Philadelphia in 1787.

The Democrats have a plan to end the war. Our Commander in Chief has 
a plan to win the war. The problem with the Democrat plan is, as Orwell 
said, ''The quickest way to end a war is to lose it.''

Let's reject the Democrat plan for withdrawal, retreat and defeat. 
Let's give our soldiers a clean bill, no pork, no strings attached, and 
let's unite this Nation behind our Commander in Chief's plan to win a 
victory for freedom in Iraq.
