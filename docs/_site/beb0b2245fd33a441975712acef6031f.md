Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is irresponsible for Congress to 
operate this way.

With the provisions in this bill, Congress is deserting our 
commitments to our military leaders and telling them that none of it 
matters, the war is over and your mission is done. Congress, with this 
bill, is reneging on the war and sending our men and women in uniform a 
demoralizing message.

I am committed to giving our military, led by General Petraeus, time 
and resources to try to calm Baghdad.

I understand the deep national unrest over the course of the war. I 
do not support an open-ended commitment in Iraq. The Iraqi government 
must do more.

But effectively abandoning our military effort at this time poses a 
treacherous threat to the United States and the region.

We should do right by our troops, give them the resources they need 
and work with the Iraqis toward solutions that will bring our Armed 
Forces home at an appropriate time.
