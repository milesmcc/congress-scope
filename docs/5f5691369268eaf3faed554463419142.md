`Mr. BISHOP of Utah â€” 20 May 2008`

Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an 
outstanding military commander in the United States Army, Colonel Anne 
L. Davis.

As outgoing Commander of the Tooele Army Depot, TEAD, Utah, Colonel 
Davis has demonstrated exceptional meritorious service


during her tenure from June 16, 2005 to July 8, 2008. TEAD is a very 
large military installation, with 23,600 acres with extensive munitions 
storage handling an estimated 200,000 short tons of ammunition stocks 
valued at $2.75 billion. She was responsible for logistical support to 
17 United States military units as well as command and control of 
Hawthorne Ammunition Depot, Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant and Ft. 
Wingate.

Colonel Davis is a brilliant leader who makes every mission look 
easy. Her PhD in Business added to her skills to better manage and 
transform Tooele into the Depot of the future. The leaders who worked 
under her took pride in achieving nearly 100 percent on time, on 
location delivery of ammunition throughout the Western Continental 
United States and to various ports to support ongoing combat operations 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Colonel Davis was instrumental in the development, testing, prove-out 
and eventual preparation of the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams Combat 
Configured Loads. Her ability to safely and efficiently manage 
stockpile surveillance inspections while enduring personnel shortages 
in terms of Quality Assurance and Surveillance Specialists was superb.

Colonel Davis aggressively sought additional workload at Tooele by 
meeting with the Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development and by 
attending numerous business events throughout the country in an effort 
to reduce life cycle costs on her installation. Her personal attention 
in all aspects of safety, to include the Department of Defense Safety 
Voluntary Protection Program resulted in a 50 percent reduction in 
civilian days lost due to accidents.

Colonel Davis, a native of St. Clair Shores, Michigan, arrived at 
Tooele Army Depot in June 2005 as a highly regarded and decorated 
leader in the Army having served in leadership positions in Italy, 
Hawaii, and the Continental United States. She also commanded Hawthorne 
Army Depot in Hawthorne, Nevada from June 2000 to July 2003.

Lean Six Sigma, LSS, was implemented by Colonel Davis to ensure the 
Army's competitive edge and increase employee involvement. Under her 
control, TEAD has certified over 70 Green Belts and has an established 
self-sufficient LSS program with a Master Black Belt and four Black 
Belts. Involving over half of the workforce in projects, Colonel Davis 
has overseen savings to the Depot of over $560,000 in the first two 
years with another $400,000 expected by the end of this fiscal year.

In conclusion, Madam Speaker, Colonel Davis has served her nation 
well and exhibited some of the finest qualities of leadership and good 
stewardship of her many responsibilities. She will be missed by the 
Tooele workforce and by those with whom she has associated in Utah over 
the past 3 years. I join with the rest of the Utah Congressional 
Delegation in offering our sincere congratulations on a job well-done, 
and wishing her the very best for her in all future endeavors.
