`Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania â€” 6 October 2009`

---


Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tonight, October 
6, at 10:03 p.m., we have a very special night. My colleagues and I 
stand here tonight to champion the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell 
policy. Repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell is important. It's important 
for three reasons.

Number one, it is vital to our national security that we repeal Don't 
Ask, Don't Tell. We have kicked out over 13,000 troops since we enacted 
this law 16 years ago. We have kicked out over 400 troops just this 
year, in 2009. When our commanders on the ground are desperate for 
troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, now is not the time to throw them out--
not for any type of sexual misconduct, but just because they're gay.

Number two, do we need to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell because it is 
doing right by our taxpayers? It is costing the American taxpayer $1.3 
billion to throw these young American heroes out of our military just 
because of their sexual orientation. It costs the American taxpayer 
$60,000 to recruit these young heroes to come in, to train them up, to 
make them warriors, and then we just disregard them just because of 
their sexual orientation.

And, lastly, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy goes against the very 
fabric of what makes our country the greatest country on Earth, the 
fact that we're all created equal.

Mr. Speaker, we have colleagues, Members of this great House here 
tonight to argue about the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. There are 
176 cosponsors to repeal this act, but one of these Members is the 
highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve the United States 
Congress. He was a command sergeant major. That is the highest rank you 
can become in the United States Army in the enlisted ranks. He is a 
sophomore Congressman from Minnesota. His name is Tim Walz. He is an 
American patriot and a hero, and I'd like to turn it over to my 
colleague and my friend, Tim Walz from the great State of Minnesota.
