Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my 
colleagues that we are engaged in what truly is a global war on 
terrorism. The war in which we are fighting does not have borders. It 
is not contained to Iraq and Afghanistan. Again last week the United 
Kingdom reported that up to eight police officers and several public 
officials were uncovered with ties to extremist groups, including al 
Qaeda, who may have also attended terror training camps in Pakistan and 
Afghanistan.

Everyone should be concerned about the recent series of suicide 
bombings in northwest Pakistan. Al Qaeda has established safe havens in 
the border areas of Pakistan, a nuclear armed nation. The tribal area 
of North Waziristan announced on Sunday that they are ending a 10-month 
ceasefire with the government. These terrorist attacks follow last 
week's mass murder of police officers in Algeria, and the beheading of 
10 Army personnel in the Philippines. Americans must face the threat 
that modern civilization is under attack worldwide.

I am proud of our brave men and women in uniform who fight daily to 
ensure that American families are protected.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we'll never forget September 
the 11th.
