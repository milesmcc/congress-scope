Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor St. Richard Parish 
in Chicago, Illinois. Saint Richard Parish is hosting its tenth annual 
Salute to Veterans on Sunday, September 27, 2009.

 This celebration, which honors all veterans living and deceased, was 
started ten years ago by a group of veterans led by Joseph Pierce, 
William Izquierdo, George Vescovi, and Daniel Costa. All members of the 
community have been invited to join in honoring the men and women who 
served our country in the past and those who continue to serve today.

 Veterans groups and organizations from throughout the community will 
come together for this special celebration, which will include a Mass 
to be followed by a program honoring veterans. I look forward to the 
honor and privilege of participating in this event for our brave 
veterans.

 Prior to the service, a special ceremony will be held in remembrance 
of all who have lost their lives in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, 
including Pfc. Omar Torres, a member of the parish who was killed in 
Iraq in 2007.

 I ask you to join me in honoring the members of St. Richard for 
their civic dedication and the veterans who will be celebrated for 
their incredible and selfless service to our nation.
