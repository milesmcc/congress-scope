Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
might consume.

Madam Speaker, let me begin my remarks by saying that I'm pleased 
that until last week, we appeared to be following regular order by 
actually having an open meeting of House and Senate conferees.

As I and the vast majority of Republicans have suggested several 
times through this process, we want this troop funding bill to be an 
up-and-down vote and, ideally, a bipartisan vote.

I want to commend my colleagues, Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha, 
for producing a bill that accurately reflected the real needs and 
priorities of the troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the 
House-passed bill wasn't perfect, it did garner bipartisan support, 
including that of 168 Republican Members.

Unfortunately, what I'm hearing and reading about, the final ''deal'' 
that was struck between Chairman Obey and Senator Inouye leads me to 
believe that the final package will not enjoy the same bipartisan 
support. As reported, the deal struck by the two Appropriations 
chairmen would do the following:

First, cut over $4.6 billion from Defense and MilCon from the House-
passed levels.

Further, it would increase foreign operations funding by $5.2 billion 
over the House-passed levels, and $2.6 billion over the Senate-passed 
bill.

Further, it would include $5 billion in funding for the IMF to secure 
a whopping $108 billion of loans; in essence, the IMF would be funded 
at levels some $30 billion above the troop funding level. So we have 
troop funding, on the one hand, that has been reduced, and we've got a 
sizable expansion of foreign aid.

Further, the bill includes $1 billion of new spending for what we 
have been calling ''Cash for Clunkers'' on the floor. That amount was 
not in the bill as it passed the House either.

Now, let me shift gears and briefly explain the motion before us. 
It's a straightforward motion that insists on the House funding levels 
of $84.5 billion for the defense and military construction portions of 
the supplemental.

Further, it also insists on the lower top line for overall funding 
levels of $91.3 billion contained in the Senate-passed bill for the 
entire supplemental.

Further, it requires the text of the conference agreement be 
available in an electronic, downloadable and searchable form for 48 
hours prior to consideration by the House. This language is identical 
to the motion unanimously adopted and subsequently ignored by my 
friends in the majority


when considering our massive stimulus bill.

Finally, this motion insists on the Senate position regarding 
prohibition on the release of detainee photos sponsored by Senators 
Graham and Lieberman.

Clearly, the focus of this supplemental funding bill should be on the 
troops, not IMF, not foreign aid funding, not Cash for Clunkers, or 
just using the emergency circumstances to buy down fiscal year 2010 
spending.

Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of the motion.

I reserve my time.
