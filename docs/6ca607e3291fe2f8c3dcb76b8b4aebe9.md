Mr. BOUSTANY. Would the gentleman yield? I want to amplify on that. 
That delay really caused a lot of problems, particularly as the State 
Department tried to mobilize its part of the surge. It really froze 
their efforts for a while, and so there was a delay in getting those 
personnel on the ground to amplify what was being done from a security 
standpoint.

And I was meeting yesterday with SSG Paul Gwimes in my office. He 
served with the 256th in Iraq. He told me, and I have seen this when I 
have gone over there on two previous occasions, our men and women watch 
these news programs, and they watch C-SPAN, and they hear what we say. 
And it has an impact. We need to do everything we can to support them. 
I yield back to my friend.
