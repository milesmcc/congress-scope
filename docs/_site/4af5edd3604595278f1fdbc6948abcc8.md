`Mr. THUNE â€” 12 April 2007`

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I agree with 
everything he said. The thing I guess that has troubled me about this 
process since the inception of the debate we have had in the Senate, 
that has been swirling around in Washington for some time, has to do 
with the way this supplemental bill was constructed and the 
proscriptive language that was put in it relative to tying the hands of 
our Commander in Chief, tying the hands of our generals, essentially 
substituting the judgment of politics in Washington for the judgment of 
our generals in the field.

I am extremely troubled by that language, as is the President, which 
is why he has indicated he is going to veto this bill when it comes 
before him. They knew that. They knew that when it was passed. They 
knew when it went down there, it was going to be an issue which the 
President, absolutely, in his constitutional role as Commander in 
Chief, could not allow--that type of language and that type of 
restriction--to be imposed on his ability to prosecute and win wars.

But I guess my question to the Senator from Alabama has to do with: 
If the Senate or the House wanted to stop what is happening in Iraq, 
wanted to withdraw, get our troops home immediately--in spite of the 
fact that under this new strategy we now have more troops there, we 
have different rules of engagement, we have more buy-in from the 
Iraqis; the Iraqis are coming more into the fight; we have an 
opportunity, in my view, at least, hopefully, to have success there--
what is the step the Congress, if they wanted to basically end our 
involvement there, could do? Is it not to cut off funding? Would that 
not be?

If the Senate and the House were serious about this, why is it they 
are going about all these shenanigans, trying to provoke this 
confrontation with the President over this particular language that 
ties his hands relative to time lines, when in fact the real 
constitutional role the Congress has is funding? Is funding not the 
way, if the Senate and the House wanted to be heard on this, they would 
go about doing that?
