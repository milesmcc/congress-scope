Mr. MINNICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my strong support to 
Senate bill 509. This bipartisan legislation will authorize the 
construction of a new outpatient clinic at the VA Medical Center in 
Walla Walla, Washington. The Walla Walla VA hospital provides vital 
medical care to thousands of veterans from Idaho and a new state-of-
the-art facility will allow the hospital to provide expanded services 
to the members of our armed forces.

As more of our troops continue to return home from their deployments 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is crucial that they receive the timely and 
effective care they deserve. And with Veterans Day just around the 
corner, this is an excellent opportunity to honor those who have 
sacrificed so much for our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in 
passing this important legislation.

I thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for their strong 
leadership and continued commitment to improving the lives of veterans.
