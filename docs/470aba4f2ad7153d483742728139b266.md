`Mrs. BOXER â€” 28 July 2009`

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to CDR Duane G. 
Wolfe, a sailor from my home State of California who paid the ultimate 
price in service to our country in Iraq.

Commander Wolfe, of Los Osos, CA, died on May 25, 2009, from injuries 
suffered when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb southeast of 
Fallujah, Iraq.

He is the oldest Californian to have lost his life in either Iraq or 
Afghanistan to date, electing to continue to serve as a member of the 
U.S. military despite having the option to retire.

Commander Wolfe enlisted in the Navy in 1972 shortly after graduating 
high school and served on Active Duty for 5 years. In 1978, he joined 
the Navy Reserves, where he served until his death. He also worked for 
24 years as a civilian employee at Vandenberg Air Force Base, rising to 
the position of civilian deputy commander for installation support for 
the 30th Mission Support Group.

As a member of the Navy Reserves, Commander Wolfe deployed to Iraq in 
December 2008 for a 6-month assignment. He served as the officer in 
charge of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Al Anbar Area Office, 
leading a team that oversaw nearly $300 million in construction 
projects including many that provide essential services to the Iraqi 
people. He was due to return home on July 10, 2009.

In addition to his military service, Commander Wolfe was a longtime 
deacon for the Los Osos Church of Christ where he taught Bible classes 
and occasionally filled in as a substitute preacher. He was a skilled 
lifelong athlete who loved golfing and playing basketball, and a 
talented mechanic, with a particular aptitude for both construction and 
car repair.

At the age of 19, Commander Wolfe met his wife Cindi, to whom he was 
married for 34 happy years. He and his wife have three children, 
Carrie, Katie and Evan, who remember their father for his kindness, 
warmth, and dedication to his family and country.

Commander Wolfe will be posthumously awarded the Bronze Star with 
''V'' Device for Valor, the Purple Heart, the Navy Combat Action 
Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal with Service Star, the Iraqi 
Campaign Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with ''M'' Device for 
Mobilization, and the Overseas Service Ribbon, commemorating his 
courage and extraordinary sacrifice in service to our country.

Nothing can fully account for the loss suffered by Commander Wolfe's 
family and all those who loved him.


But I hope they can take comfort in the knowledge that he will be 
forever honored and remembered by a grateful nation.

As we remember Commander Wolfe and honor his service to the United 
States, we are also reminded of the eight other Californians who have 
been killed in Iraq since April 21. This brings to 879 the number of 
servicemembers either from California or based in California that have 
been killed while serving our country in Iraq. This represents 20 
percent of all U.S. deaths in Iraq.
