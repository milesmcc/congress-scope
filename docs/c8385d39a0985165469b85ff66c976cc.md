Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I voted against the war in Iraq in part 
because I feared the challenges that the United States would face 
installing a government that was both democratic and responsible. I am 
increasingly concerned about the recent reports concerning the 
corruption of the Maliki government in Iraq. The Bush Administration 
has told us that the controversial troop surge has led to political 
progress in Iraq. The unfortunate reality is that corruption has been 
prevalent throughout the Iraqi government, hindering political progress 
in the nation. Even worse, our own government has attempted to shield 
the American people from the disturbing reality of what is really going 
on in the Iraqi government. I am pleased that the House of 
Representatives is considering this resolution, which condemns the 
deceptive actions of the State Department.
