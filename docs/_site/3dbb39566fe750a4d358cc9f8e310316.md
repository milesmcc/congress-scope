Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States had a 
chance to fully fund the troops just a few weeks ago, he chose not to 
take it, I tell my friend, Mr. Tiahrt, from Kansas. We fully funded the 
troops. In fact, we gave more money for the fight against terrorism. We 
want to see success.

Mr. Speaker, let every Member here and all those watching this debate 
at home be perfectly clear, this legislation fully funds our troops in 
harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, ensuring that they have the 
resources they need to conduct their missions. Not only that, this bill 
includes additional funding, as the last bill did, not requested by the 
President, to fight the war on terror, to improve America's military 
readiness and to meet our veterans' unmet health needs.

However, while this legislation funds our troops, it insists, as we 
tried to last time, for the first time in more than 4 years that the 
Bush Administration and the Iraqi government be accountable. The 
American public expects accountability.

Plain and simple, this legislation responds to the will of the 
people, who are dismayed by the failed implementation of American 
foreign policy, perhaps more failed than in any in the generation.

On Tuesday, a CNN poll found that two-thirds of Americans oppose the 
war, and 61 percent support benchmarks like the ones in this bill that 
would measure Iraqi progress.



Let me say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, Vice 
President Cheney was deployed by this administration. What for? To tell 
the Iraqis they had to perform, that they had to meet benchmarks; that 
the American public was running thin on its support, and in fact is not 
supporting this war.

But, frankly, the Congress has taken the position that we won't say 
that, and the President vetoes a bill that said that, a bill that 
required performance so that the millions that the American public, the 
billions that the American public, the $500 billion-plus that the 
American public has dug from their pockets, will be responsibly met by 
the Iraqi Government.

Thus, Mr. Speaker, this legislation holds the President and the Iraqi 
Government accountable by fencing off 52-plus of the $95.5 billion 
provided to the Defense Department until released by subsequent 
legislation.

What is there to fear from this Congress as we oversee whether or not 
there is a turn from an unsuccessful implementation of a policy to a 
successful policy? Perhaps that fear is that that corner will not be 
turned, and therefore this vote may be at risk.

Before this additional funding is released, however, the President 
must report to Congress by July 13 regarding the success of the Iraqi 
Government in meeting security and political benchmarks. General 
Petraeus has said there is no solution but a political solution, and 
the only people who can accomplish a political solution are the Iraqis 
themselves.

What do we ask for? Disarming militias who are killing our men and 
women, enacting legislation to equitably share oil revenues. There will 
be no resolution without that. Reforming the debaathification process, 
which says to literally tens of thousands of people, we know you were 
Baath members, but you really weren't in politics, so you can come back 
and do the work to build this society. Without that, we will not 
succeed and our men and women will pay the price, as they are paying 
the price every day.

Lastly, providing for provisional elections. We are fighting for 
democracy. We are investing in democracy. That is what we are told. But 
we haven't amended the constitution and we are not providing for the 
provincial elections that were promised. If that is the case, the Iraqi 
people are not going to think democracy is on its way.

Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States himself has stated 
that our commitment in Iraq is not open-ended. That is what this 
legislation says. If you think it is open-ended, if you think there 
should be no benchmarks, if you think the American taxpayers' money 
ought to be spent without seeing results and without the carnage to our 
troops decreasing, then vote against this.

To this we say, no more. No more blank checks. Not after more than 
3,370 Americans have lost their lives in Iraq and more than 25,000 have 
been injured. Ten percent of those lives have been lost in the last 4 
months. Not after the American taxpayer spent nearly half a trillion 
dollars. And not after 4 years of egregious misjudgments by this 
administration, from ''mission accomplished,'' to ''the insurgency is 
in its last throes,'' to ''Iraq will fund its own reconstruction.''

Every Member in this body, every Member, hopes and prays that the 
current troop escalation succeeds, that the Iraqis stabilize and secure 
their country and that our troops can return home safely. Why should 
you fear waiting 60 days and making another judgment as to whether that 
is occurring? That is our responsibility.

We swore an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States 
which says that we are the policymakers. But there is little reason for 
optimism when the violence in Iraq continues unabated and progress on 
the ground is somewhere between illusive and nonexistent.

The two-step funding approach in this legislation effected by Mr. 
Obey and Mr. Murtha is not only appropriate, it is imperative. Even the 
Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has stated, ''I think the time 
to look at where we are is late summer.'' This is a few days before 
that, and we will continue consideration into that late summer that 
Senator McConnell talks about.

We cannot want to succeed more than the Iraqis. They must take the 
lead in restoring stability and securing their nation. And the Iraqi 
Parliament must not go on vacation while American men and women are 
fighting and dying for them.

I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, support this bill. 
Let us forge a new direction in Iraq and implement a policy and design 
to succeed.
