Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it's an honor to welcome today Reverend 
Wade A. Hyslop, Jr., from New London, Connecticut, to lead the House in 
prayer this morning.

If he looked comfortable in the podium today, there is a reason for 
that. For 10 years he served in Connecticut as the deputy speaker of 
the House of Representatives, someone with whom I served as a colleague 
on the Human Services Committee and have seen up close the work and 
impact that he has had in the City of New London and across the State 
of Connecticut.

He is joined today by his family, who is here, his wife, Jessie; his 
three children; his son, Bertram, who is a sergeant major in the U.S. 
Army, serving today in Washington, DC, but also served our country in 
two deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Again, Wade leads a congregation, the Trinity Missionary Baptist 
Church in New London, Connecticut, which I have had the opportunity to 
visit a number of times. It is an energetic, warm congregation, which 
is clearly being led by a wonderful person whose impact has been felt, 
not only in that congregation, but the City of New London and the State 
of Connecticut.

Again, it's a pleasure to welcome him here today and get us off to a 
good start.
