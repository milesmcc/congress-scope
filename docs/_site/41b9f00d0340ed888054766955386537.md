# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mr. STARK â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I voted against the original resolution 
authorizing President Bush to take military action against Iraq. As a 
Member of the Out of Iraq and Progressive caucuses, I have and will 
continue to call for the immediate withdrawal of American troops.

I rise today in strong opposition to the President's proposal to send 
more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq. 
Today's non-binding resolution is an important first step. After its 
passage, I will encourage my colleagues in Congress to take further 
steps to end the War in Iraq.

When a scientist uncovers facts that contradict a theory, he or she 
throws out that theory. But when President Bush learns of facts that 
contradict his theories, he throws out the facts. As a member of the 
reality-based community, I continue to be amazed by this President's 
disregard for objective truths.

The President, however, isn't just a scientist experimenting with 
chemicals in a laboratory. He is an executive whose decision to take us 
to war under false pretenses has adversely affected the lives of 
millions of Americans and Iraqis. The costs of the nearly four-year old 
conflict are grave.

More than 3,100 brave American servicemen and women, including at 
least 325 from my home state of California, have already died in the 
war. An additional 23,000 plus have been wounded. Estimates of the 
number of Iraqi civilians killed since the invasion run even higher, 
from 47,000 to 70,000. All at a cost of $379 billion to the American 
people. That's more than $1250 for every man, woman, and child 
currently living in the U.S.

But these are facts. President Bush is more interested in cockamamy 
theories.

In the run-up to the war, Bush speculated that Iraq possessed nuclear 
weapons. When intelligence officers suggested that might not be the 
case, he ignored them. To date, no weapons of mass destruction have 
been found.

Bush also hypothesized that the attack would turn Iraq into a liberal 
democracy. When academic scholars wrote that Iraq's history and culture 
didn't suggest such an outcome was likely, he dismissed them. Today, 
despite the election of an Iraqi Assembly and formation of an Iraqi 
government, the country is in a full-fledged civil war.

During the past four years, the President has repeatedly theorized 
that America was making progress in Iraq, and that ''success'' was just 
around the corner. I remember, in particular, Bush's summer 2003 
statement that ''major combat operations in Iraq have ended,'' his 
summer 2004 claim that we were ''turning the corner'' abroad, and 
Cheney's summer 2005 reference to an insurgency in its ''last throes.'' 
Despite these promises, the situation in Iraq has gotten worse every 
year, not better.

My favorite declaration came this past summer, when the President 
said that the formation of a new Iraqi government represented a 
''turning point.''

Unfortunately, the body count in Iraq continues to grow. This past 
July, an average of 110 Iraqi adults died each day, the deadliest month 
of the war for Iraq. In October, militia attacks spiked 22 percent. In 
December, more than 100 American troops were killed, the third 
deadliest month of the war for the United States.

But the November elections did represent a turning point--in the 
United States. The Bush administration no longer has a Republican 
Congress to lick its boots. What's more, voting on this resolution will 
soon suggest President Bush doesn't even have the support of his own 
party.

When the President in January suggested sending additional troops to 
Iraq, Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle criticized his 
foolhardy proposal. Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican from Nebraska, 
termed it ''Alice in Wonderland'' thinking that would ''represent the 
most dangerous foreign policy blunder since Vietnam.''

Retired military personnel weren't much more enthusiastic. Former 
General Barry McCaffrey called the surge ''a fool's errand.'' Retired 
Colonel Paul Hughes said ''sending more troops to Baghdad is like 
pouring more water in the sands of Al-Anbar. It's just going to 
disappear without accomplishing anything.''

I couldn't agree more. The President's proposal to escalate the war 
in Iraq in the naive hope of winning a lasting peace is another 
cockamamy theory that contradicts all available facts.

I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ''yes'' and take this important 
first step to end the War in Iraq and bring all of our troops home.
