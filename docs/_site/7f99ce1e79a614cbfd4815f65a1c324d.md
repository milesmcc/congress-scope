Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Before yielding to the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Deal, I would just 
like to comment on my colleague from Wisconsin and say to have lost 18 
of his constituents is heart wrenching, and I know that his statement 
is heartfelt.

But, in fact, we are involved in the Arab League. We have involved 
five of the states surrounding, and every one of the ambassadors from 
this Arab League said, we didn't want you to go in, but you cannot 
leave.

I would just say to the gentleman as well that we asked, critics 
asked you and others for a new team and a new plan. You have a new 
team, and you do have a new plan. The new plan is not the surge in 
troops. The new plan is coming into the neighborhoods in Baghdad with 
Iraqis, embedded American troops, cleaning them up, and holding them.
