Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman 
Rangel and my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for including 
provisions from H.R. 337 and H.R. 515 in the HEART Act. Including these 
two bills is particularly meaningful for me because both were inspired 
by servicemembers and veterans in my district who came to me and said 
we have problems needing your attention.

The first bill addresses a harmful glitch in the Supplemental 
Security Income program. Because eligibility for SSI benefits is based 
on income, a family struggling to get by actually loses benefits for 
their children from any increase in military pay considered ''unearned 
income.'' Military families do not deserve to lose the benefits they 
badly need because a parent chooses to serve in the Armed Forces.

The second bill fixes a serious flaw in the CalVet Home Loan program 
limiting eligibility to servicemembers who signed up prior to 1977. 
This prevents many veterans from the first Gulf War and nearly all 
veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from taking advantage of 
the CalVet program. H.R. 6081 removes the date of service provision, 
giving servicemembers retiring in California a greater opportunity to 
own a home.
