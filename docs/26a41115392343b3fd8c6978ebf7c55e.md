Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Madam President.

Let me say, as someone who has been to the area--my understanding is 
that the Senator from Virginia has not traveled to Iraq; perhaps his 
experience in visiting with members of the military is different from 
mine--I have talked regularly with members of the military. As I have 
noted from the communication I received from this marine, it was 
reflective of the general response I get whenever I talk about what is 
happening in Iraq with members who are there currently. I think that is 
very reflective of the general overall view of those who wear the 
uniform of the United States. They believe in our mission, what we are 
doing. They want to give the strategy a chance to succeed. I believe we 
need to do that. I hope we will be able to defeat the Levin-Reed 
amendment when it comes up for a vote tomorrow.

I yield the floor.
