Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, while our troops are on 
the battlefield continuing to go without critical funding needed to 
fulfill their missions, Democrat leaders still refuse to put forward a 
clean supplemental bill.

Last week, Senate Democrat Leader Harry Reid declared the Iraq war 
''lost.'' Just yesterday, a Democrat Congressman said it is the job of 
Congress to micromanage the war. Our military leaders should manage the 
war, not politicians in Washington.

Despite reports of progress by our military leaders, Democrats 
continue to advocate withdrawal and defeat. This puts American families 
at risk at home. Early withdrawal will escalate, not end, the global 
war on terrorism.

Our troops deserve more from the men and women elected to provide for 
their well-being. Members of both parties should support our troops and 
pass a clean supplemental bill.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
