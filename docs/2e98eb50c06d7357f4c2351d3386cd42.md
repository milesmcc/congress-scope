`Mr. PRICE of Georgia â€” 11 June 2007`

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. That really is true. When I talk with groups at 
home, and once we get past the hot button, the headline issues of Iraq 
and immigration and the like, people are concerned about education for 
their kids and they are concerned about health care for themselves and 
their parents. They are concerned about security and quality of life 
issues in their community to make certain that there is going to be 
green space and there are places where can take their kids.

I was sitting in my office and I had to come down and join you. These 
are not Republican issues or Democrat issues, these are American 
issues.



They're issues that I think all of the House can rally around. And 
you mentioned the health care issue, and as a physician, I understand 
as well as anybody I suspect about the importance of being able to 
provide health insurance for families.

We live in a world now where jobs aren't constant. It used to be that 
your dad and my dad and other folks, they'd get a job and they'd be 
with that same company 25, 30, 35 years, and they'd get a gold watch 
and they'd move on and they'd take that health care with them. Now, 
that's not the case. Our children will have 7, 8, 9, 10 different jobs, 
10 different employers and oftentimes having themselves as being self-
employed.
