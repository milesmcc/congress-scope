# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `216ad21910c3c82750bed0beec7fc4df`
`Mr. ISRAEL â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentlewoman.

Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by setting the record straight. I have 
heard my friends on the other side talk about this resolution as 
calling for withdrawal, as calling for retreat. There is nothing in 
this resolution that says withdraw; there is nothing in this resolution 
that says retreat; there is nothing in this resolution that says exit.

What this resolution says is that we support our troops, and we do 
not believe that it is a good idea to add 20,000 more troops to a 
policy that has not worked.

In October of 2002, I voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq. I 
believed then, as I believe now, that the Middle East is a dangerous 
place and that you have to use a combination of hard power and soft 
power to help change the trajectory of the Middle East from a place 
that teaches kids how to blow things up to a place that teaches kids 
how to put things together.

In January of 2005, I visited our troops in Iraq, and I remember 
sitting with General Casey and asking him, How many foreign fighters 
are here and how many insurgents? And at that point, January 2005, the 
General said, Congressman, there are about 500 foreign fighters and 
there are about 5,000 insurgents. And so what to do? We committed more 
force to try and solve that problem.

And then I went back to Iraq in April of 2006, 15 months later, and I 
asked General Casey, How many foreign fighters are there and how many 
insurgents? And General Casey said, Congressman, there are 5,000 
foreign fighters, there used to be 500, now 5,000; there used to be 
5,000 insurgents, now there are 20,000 insurgents. And so what did we 
do? We threw in more force.

And now a year after that we stand here debating a resolution on 
whether we should commit another 20,000 troops to a mission that is 
poorly planned, from a military that has been strained by that poor 
planning and that is ill conceived.

Now, I want to be very clear, Mr. Speaker. If the President of the 
United States asked me to support additional troops into Afghanistan 
tonight to find Osama bin Laden, who by the way was the one who killed 
over 100 of my constituents, or to stop the resurgence of the Taliban, 
which by the way was the group of people who really gave aid and 
comfort to the enemy, I would vote for that tonight. I absolutely would 
vote for that tonight. But this decision by the President to put 20,000 
more people into Iraq is the wrong number at the wrong place at the 
wrong time.

Mr. Speaker, during this debate I have heard my colleagues talk about 
the messages that we are sending our troops and how it will affect 
their morale, and I have an obligation as somebody who supports our 
military to suggest that if we had given our troops up-armor for their 
Humvees, Kevlar for their vests, night-vision goggles that work, and 
consistent rotations, their morale would be much better.

Our troops are not afraid of democracy being waged on the floor of 
the House of Representatives. And, in fact, on the chance that our 
enemies are listening to this debate, let me suggest that this debate 
doesn't give aid and comfort to our enemies. It tells our enemies what 
democracy is about. So for our enemies who may be listening: welcome to 
democracy. This is what it sounds like, this is what it looks like, and 
this is what we are willing to fight for.

What our servicemembers deserve to hear is the truth. What they 
deserve is a government that confronts reality rather than simply 
hoping for the best. So here is the truth, Mr. Speaker: somewhere 
between those who believe that we can stay the course in Iraq 
indefinitely and those who believe that we should leave Iraq tomorrow 
is the painful truth. The truth is that neither of those options will 
work.

Now, if you agree with me that that is the painful reality, then you 
are left with a hard choice: add 20,000 troops to continue the 
administration's ineffective plan, or try something different. 20,000 
additional troops to Iraq, or rebuild our readiness here at home to 
deal with the growing challenges of Iran or naval expansion in China or 
genocide in Darfur or the other dangers in the world. Hold the Iraqi 
Government accountable for accelerating the training of their troops, 
or continue hoping for the best while putting the burden on the backs 
of 20,000 more U.S. troops.

Let me make two other points. The gentleman who preceded me, my 
friend from California, said, what do you have to offer? We have 
offered ideas; we have offered ideas from day one. The problem has been 
the stubborn resistance by the administration to listen to our ideas.

I have been advocating with my friend from California (Mrs. Tauscher) 
a status of forces agreement in Iraq, so that we would send the message 
that we are not occupiers, that we don't want to be there for one day 
longer than we need to be. The administration has rejected that.

I have been advocating with my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Carney) 
a one-for-one resolution. I and others have been advocating a formula, 
a one-for-one formula that says that for every Iraqi security force 
that stands up an American will be redeployed.

So we have provided ideas. And I want to once again offer a 
bipartisan invitation to my colleagues to work with us, because whether 
this resolution passes or not, the war is not going to end the next 
day. We still have many challenges ahead, and we are going to have to 
work together.

And, finally, Mr. Speaker, let me make a point about some of the 
characterizations that we have been listening to. As a Democrat, I know 
that there is not a single Republican who wakes up in the morning 
wanting this war to last for one day longer than it has to last. And in 
the same spirit, I am offended by anyone who would suggest that there 
is a Democrat who gives aid and comfort to the enemy, who wants us to 
be defeated, who wants us to lose. That is not what we are about.

We need to end the sound bites and the partisanship and the war rooms 
off the floor of the House that tell people what to say, and begin 
formulating effective policy for the troops that are listening to us 
tonight.

I visited my VA hospital yesterday, and I saw men and women in 
wheelchairs and gurneys. It didn't say Republican or Democrat on those 
wheelchairs and gurneys. When the time came, they went to fight for us. 
Our obligation is to stand by them, not with sound bites, not with 
policies that haven't worked before, but with new ideas for a stronger 
country.
