Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your courtesy in permitting me time to 
speak on this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1104 for all the reasons 
that have been articulated by my friend from California and my friend 
from Florida.

Iraq today is the scene of the fastest-growing humanitarian crisis in 
the world. It rivals only the problems that are being faced in Darfur.

As has been pointed out for one group in Iraq, our moral 
responsibility is unquestionable to Iraqis whose lives are at risk 
because they helped the United States. Having cooperated with the 
United States military, the United Nations, or even a nongovernmental 
organization, can literally mean a death sentence at the hands of any 
of the many sides of this civil war. This bill is an important first 
step, expanding the current limit of the 50 special translator visas to 
500.

I became acutely aware of the magnitude of this problem working with 
a local high school in Portland, Oregon, who were partnering with the 
members of the Oregon National Guard who had served in Iraq and 
recently returned, who were trying to bring their former translator to 
the United States, literally to save this young woman's life. But they 
kept running into bureaucratic hurdles. It took us months to, 
thankfully, secure her entry into the United States, where she is 
safely a college student today in Portland, Oregon.

I have heard the same story over and over again. We should keep faith 
with those who have served our brave men and women in uniform. This is 
a basic moral responsibility and a simple issue of fairness.

What we have before us in this bill is a critical first step. But as 
my friend from California pointed out, it's only the first step. We 
have 4 million Iraqis who have been driven from their homes and tens of 
thousands who are at risk because they helped the United States, not 
just as translators but as drivers and construction workers, NGO 
support staff.

We are, sadly, failing Iraqi refugees. We have allowed into the 
United States fewer than 800 since 2003, 69 since this fall, only 1 
last month. The Swedish prime minister told me last week that Sweden is 
going to admit 25,000 Iraqi refugees this year.

I introduced, last week, bipartisan legislation H.R. 2265, the 
Responsibility to Iraqi Refugees Act to address this ongoing 
humanitarian crisis by using all of the tools at our disposal, 
admitting refugees, providing assistance to the region and using 
diplomacy to ensure their well-being.

It would allow not 50 or 500, but 15,000 Iraqis who are at risk 
because they helped the United States to come to this country, along 
with their families. It would establish a special coordinator for Iraqi 
refugees and internally displaced people, and requires the United 
States to develop, finally, plans to ensure the well-being and safety 
of these Iraqi refugees.

It increases the number of persecuted Iraqis who can be admitted as 
refugees. This legislation has been endorsed by Amnesty International, 
Church World Service, the International Rescue Committee, Refugees 
International, the Jubilee Campaign, the Truman National Security 
Project, and many others.

I strongly urge that we adopt this bill today. But I would implore 
the Members of this House, regardless of how they feel about the war in 
Iraq or its future, to join and cosponsor my legislation--broad, 
ambitious, a comprehensive response to the Iraqi refugee crisis--before 
it's too late, too


late for people whose only crime was working with Americans.

It is also clear that it is not just these Iraqis that we ought to be 
concerned about. If we cannot keep faith with refugees that the United 
States has a responsibility for, it sends a very unpleasant message 
about the reliability of working with us, and, sadly, it sows the seeds 
for additional instability in the region. With 1 million Iraqis in 
Jordan, it creates an untenable situation for the long-term stability 
of that country.

I strongly urge passage of this bill, but I do hope that each of my 
colleagues will look at the comprehensive legislation that I introduced 
and determine what they are going to do to stop the fastest-growing 
humanitarian crisis in the world today.
