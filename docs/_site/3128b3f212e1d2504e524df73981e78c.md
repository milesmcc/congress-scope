`Mr. BYRD â€” 14 February 2008`

---


Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on February 11, 2008, the Congressional 
Budget Office responded to an inquiry from Senator Kent Conrad, the 
chairman of the Committee on the Budget, regarding the costs to date of 
U.S. operations and involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Allow me to 
quote in full the critical summary line of this letter:




 If the administration's request for 2008 is funded in full, 


 appropriations for military operations and other war-related 


 activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the war on 


 terrorism will rise to $188 billion this year and to a 


 cumulative total of $752 billion since 2001.


It can be difficult to truly grasp how large a number is $752 
billion. Let me offer some comparisons. According to Forbes Magazine, 
the world's most expensive car, a 1930 Bugatti Type 41 Royale, is worth 
an estimated $10 million. For $752 billion, one could own a


fleet--a fleet--of 75,200 Bugatti Type 41 Royales; that is, if more 
than 6 had ever been made, or for $752 billion one could purchase 442 
space shuttles at $1.7 billion each, according to NASA.

Here is one final comparison: According to the Bureau of the Census, 
the average price of a home in the United States in 2007 was $311,600. 
Let me repeat: According to the Bureau of the Census, the average price 
of a home in the United States in 2007 was $311,600, assuming one could 
still get a mortgage in today's real estate market. For $752 billion, 
one could buy 2,413,000 homes--enough homes to house every family in a 
city roughly the size of Jacksonville, FL or Indianapolis, IN.

That is $752 billion and counting, as the President's fiscal year 
2009 budget request has come in, and Secretary Gates has suggested that 
after the ''surge'' troops come home, troop levels in Iraq will not--
not--drop below 130,000 for at least--at least--the remainder of this 
year. In Afghanistan, the 27,500 troops currently deployed will be 
augmented by an additional 3,200 marines this spring. So I do not 
believe that this budgetary comet will do anything but continue its 
meteoric rise.

We all might still count this $752 billion as well spent if we 
thought we were getting good value for our money, if both nations were 
being rebuilt and showing signs of stability and recovery. However, 
there is evidence that the vast sums of money being thrown at Iraq and 
Afghanistan are not all being well spent. Far too much money is being 
siphoned off to line the pockets of greedy contractors while the work 
which they are being paid to do goes undone or is poorly done. 
Alarmingly, money, weapons, and oil profits have apparently been 
delivered directly to insurgents and militias that are not under 
government control in Afghanistan and Iraq. That must be stopped.

In Afghanistan, one U.S. think tank recently estimated that only $1 
of aid out of every $10 actually reaches an Afghan. In Iraq, a local 
Iraqi businessman told a reporter that:




 I'd say that about 10 percent of business was corrupt under 


 Saddam. Now, it's about 95 percent. We used to have one 


 Saddam, now we have 25 of them.


Despite the growing reports of corrupt practices and the rising 
number of allegations of the fraud, waste, and abuse of Government 
contracts, not enough is being done to apply diplomatic pressure on the 
Governments in Iraq and Afghanistan to clean up their acts, and not 
enough resources are being applied to efforts to investigate and 
prosecute contract fraud. Congress has been watching, holding hearings, 
and complaining on behalf of the taxpayers, but much more--much more--
needs to be done. After 7 years, we cannot continue to hide behind 
feeble excuses. Too much money is being lost to continue to let the 
systemic abuses persist.

After 7 long years, 7 long years of occupation and reconstruction 
efforts, much, much remains undone that was supposed to be done long, 
long ago. As long as in-country government officials and all of the 
associated contractors continue to profit from corruption and an 
unchecked ability to commit fraud, waste, and abuse, there is little--
little, I say--incentive for anyone to make the progress that would 
assist the United States and the rest of the international community in 
departing.

American taxpayers and the Committee on Appropriations have invested 
$752 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan. We expect to see that treasure 
treated with the same respect that we give to our troops. They too have 
worked hard. They too have sacrificed much to provide the security for 
reconstruction efforts to take place. None of that sacrifice--none of 
that sacrifice--should be thrown away on cases of fraud, waste, abuse, 
and through rampant corruption. I--the personal pronoun I--intend to 
conduct a hearing on this matter as a first step, as a first step in 
what will be a long, long, hard look at just where--just where--the 
taxpayers' hard-earned money has been going.

I intend to invite Senator Dorgan, I intend to invite Senator Leahy, 
and I intend to invite Representative Waxman to testify on the findings 
of their earlier investigations. I will also invite other witnesses to 
offer their expertise on issues concerning the abuse, misuse, and loss 
of U.S. funds to corrupt practices. I appreciate the encouragement and 
support of our Democratic leader, Senator Reid, in tackling this issue.

This is not a partisan issue. Good governance and the wise use of 
taxpayer dollars are always nonpartisan goals. It is the responsibility 
of all of us--and I mean all of us--to determine the scope and the 
scale of the problems and then to devise the best--nothing but the 
best, and only the best--and fastest solutions to fix them.

I yield the floor.
