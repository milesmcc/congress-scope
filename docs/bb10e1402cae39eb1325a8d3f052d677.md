Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak and to urge our 
colleagues to please vote and pass this passage.

Now, the most important part, and, of course, all of it is very 
important, but there is one part that I want to emphasize that is so 
important on the second part; and I take quite a distaste at how the 
gentleman referred to that as pork, because the children's health 
program is not pork.

In my State of Georgia, there are 273,000 children who will go 
without their insurance or health care if we do not pass this measure.

Now, yes, we must get the funding to the troops; they are in need, 
and we certainly want to get the funding there. But let me just urge 
those in the minority on the other side of the aisle that many of these 
273,000 children who are in Georgia without health insurance belong to 
the soldiers who are serving in Iraq, and we have been working 
feverishly in each step of the way to make sure we had the SCHIP 
program included. And I want to make sure we include this all the way, 
and urge the President to sign it when we get there.
