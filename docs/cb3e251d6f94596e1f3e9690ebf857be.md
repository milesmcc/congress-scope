`Mr. CANTOR â€” 29 April 2010`

Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman.

Madam Speaker, I noticed that my friend the majority leader did not 
mention the budget or the supplemental for


Afghanistan and Iraq for next week's schedule. Obviously, both are 
extremely critical. I would like to ask, Madam Speaker, when does he 
expect those items to come to the floor?

I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
