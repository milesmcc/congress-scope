Ms. MARKEY of Colorado. Thank you, Chairman Skelton.

I rise today in support of this en bloc amendment, which contains my 
amendment to create a scholarship program for veterans to work toward 
advanced degrees in behavioral health.

One in three veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have some form of 
invisible injury like PTSD or TBI. The VA has diagnosed nearly 250,000 
vets as having some mental health injury. Yet it is well known that 
less than half of those with these injuries are ever diagnosed or 
treated.

The Department of Veteran Affairs Honor Scholarship Program is a 
critical investment in the treatment of veterans suffering from 
invisible injuries like posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic 
brain injuries.

This amendment will help veterans receive professional behavioral 
health training so that they can provide peer-to-peer training to other 
combat veterans. Who better to counsel recently returned veterans than 
those who have shared similar experiences in combat. The veterans who 
have served our country deserve the best possible mental health 
treatment.

I urge my colleagues to stand with American veterans, to honor 
America's veterans, and to support this amendment.
