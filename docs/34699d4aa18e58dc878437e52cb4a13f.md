Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker: ''Many people think the best way to escape war 
is to dwell upon its horrors and to imprint them vividly upon the minds 
of the younger generation. They flaunt the grisly photographs before 
their eyes. They fill their ears with tales of carnage. They dwell on 
the ineptitude of generals and admirals. They denounce the crime and 
the folly of human strife.''

These words of Winston Churchill in 1934 stressed upon the people of 
Great Britain that the cynics, who don't believe some things are worth 
fighting for, should not have their way. They ignore the victories and 
accomplishments and, instead, focus upon setbacks.

War is hard. It has always been hard. Congress will once again debate 
a timetable retreat for American troops to leave Iraq. The timid will 
want to turn their back on the enemy and leave a desperate people and a 
nation floundering; all this because war is hard.

Retreat tells the enemy that if they wait America out, we will bow 
out of the fight.

Mr. Speaker, Churchill also remarked, ''war is not won by 
evacuation.''

And that's just the way it is.
