Mr. HINCHEY. I thank my friend Donald Payne from New Jersey for his 
leadership and for joining us this evening.

Mr. Speaker, the point that we have made here tonight is that perhaps 
at no time in the history of this country, except for perhaps our own 
Civil War, have we faced the kind of circumstances that we are 
presently being confronted with as a result of the way in which this 
administration incompetently and corruptly has led us into this illegal 
occupation in Iraq.

We need to correct these circumstances. It is the responsibility of 
this Congress to do so. We need to hold this administration 
accountable. It is the responsibility of this Congress to do so. We 
need to remove our military forces from Iraq in an appropriate and 
timely way. And it is the responsibility of this Congress to take that 
kind of leadership.

I thank my friends and colleagues for joining us here on this very 
important 4-year anniversary of the illegal attack and subsequent 
occupation of Iraq. We need now to change these circumstances.
