Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, pursuant to the Republican 
Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following 
information regarding earmarks I received as part of H.R. 3183--Energy 
and Water Appropriations Act, 2010.

Requested by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen

Bill number: H.R. 3183

Account: Army Corps of Engineers, Construction

Amount: $500,000

Project: Florida Keys Wastewater Improvement Project

Requested by: City of Key West, City of Marathon, Key Largo 
Wastewater Treatment District

Federal funding of this project is needed to continue moving forward 
with the initiative outlined in The Florida Keys Water Quality 
Improvements Act, which authorized $100 million


for water quality improvements in the Keys. For several years there has 
been growing concern that the near-shore waters of the Florida Keys 
have been deteriorating due to inadequate wastewater and storm water 
facilities. These are the waters of the Florida Keys National Marine 
Sanctuary and home to the only living coral reef in the continental 
United States.

Requested by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen

Bill number: H.R. 3183

Account: Army Corps of Engineers, Operation and Maintenance

Amount: $4,500,000

Project: Intracoastal Waterway, Jacksonville to Miami, FL

Requested by: Florida Inland Navigation District

The Intracoastal Waterway (IWW) is a critical part of Florida's 
eastern-shore economy and therefore its timely dredging is of serious 
importance. The Waterway annually: transports over 1 million tons of 
commercial cargo and over 500,000 recreational vessels; increases 
property values by $38.4 billion; and provides $7.9 billion in economic 
output which includes $2.6 billion in personal wages and 124,857 jobs. 
Studies by FIND, the local sponsor of the IWW, have shown that these 
benefits would be reduced by 50 percent if the Waterway were not 
properly maintained.

Requested by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen

Bill number: H.R. 3183

Account: Department of Energy, EERE Account

Amount: $1,000,000

Project: Going Green Initiative

Requested by: Miami Children's Museum

This project will allow the Museum to preserve and protect the 
world's natural resources using environmentally advanced, sustainable, 
and renewable and/or recyclable materials and systems in the building. 
In addition, it will allow the Museum to educate its audience about its 
environmentally friendly building and high-performance features through 
a variety of hands-on programs and project based activities for 
classroom and home continued learning.

Requested by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen

Bill number: H.R. 3183

Account: Army Corps of Engineers, Construction

Amount: $600,000

Project: Miami Harbor Channel Dredging

Requested by: Miami-Dade County, Florida

This funding request is for the General Reevaluation Report 
Implementation, Preconstruction, Engineering, and Design for the 
dredging of Miami Harbor. The funding was authorized via 2007 (H.R. 
1495) for preconstruction, engineering, and design of the recommended 
project. This will address the federal share at 100% of the anticipated 
costs for plans and specifications preparation.

Requested by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen

Bill number: H.R. 3183

Account: Army Corps of Engineers, Operation and Maintenance

Amount: $777,000

Project: Miami River Dredging

Requested by: Miami-Dade County, Florida

This request is for the final phase of the Miami River Dredging 
Project to restore authorized depth and width to the navigation 
channel. This project, funded by the Army Corps of Engineers with a 
coalition of local sponsors led by Miami-Dade County, removes 
contaminated sediments from the Miami River--Florida's 4th largest port 
with an economic value of $4 billion. Since it was improved for 
navigation in the 1930s, the river has never received comprehensive 
maintenance dredging. Sediments have accumulated in the margins of the 
federal channel making it narrower and shallower, thereby limiting 
activities of freighters that utilize ship terminals along the river. 
Dredging and disposal of the contaminated sediments is expected to 
improve navigation and enhance the environmental quality of the River 
and downstream portions of Biscayne Bay.

Project: Bus Shelter Replacement

more adequate facilities for those waiting for public transportation in 
the hot sun, wind and rain.
