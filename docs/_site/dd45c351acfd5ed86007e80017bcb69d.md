`Mr. GOHMERT â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, when people on the other side of the aisle 
wonder how we can ask, Do you really support the troops? How about this 
quote that was contributed to Mr. Murtha? ''They won't be able to 
continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the 
equipment. They don't have the training. They won't be able to do the 
work.'' There is no question in my mind.

On his Web site that has now been taken down, it says, ''Chairman 
Murtha will describe his strategy for not only limiting the deployment 
of troops to Iraq, but undermining other aspects of the President's 
foreign and national security policy.''

He is the Commander in Chief. That is undermining the President.
