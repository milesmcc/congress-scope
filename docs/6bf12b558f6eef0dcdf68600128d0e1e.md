`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 30 July 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the gentlewoman from California, and I want to 
commend her for her support.

Madam Speaker, I am proud to lead a bipartisan coalition of Members 
from both sides of the aisle that support the cause of Liberia, and I 
want to thank and extend my gratitude to them and to all parties for 
bringing this bill to the floor today.

Minority Leader and Whip Blunt, Congressman Mike Pence, Congressman 
Tim Walberg, and my good friend from Minnesota, Jim Ramstad, have come 
together because we all believe in the Liberian-American community.

I would also like to recognize Congressman Keith Ellison, a true 
champion of the Liberian-Americans, for his steadfast support and 
dedication to this cause, as well as to Chairman Conyers and again to 
Chairwoman Lofgren on the Judiciary Committee for her strong leadership 
on this issue.

Madam Speaker, as you can hear from this debate, this is an issue 
where we have had a country that has had a unique history with our 
Nation. It is a country that was founded by former American slaves. It 
was a country that was established by this country for those liberated 
American slaves; and it was a country whose refugees came back here 
because of a war that was in part fueled by American guns, where we 
supported former General Taylor and General Doe.

So it is a tragedy that was exacerbated because America supported a 
civil war that cost the descendents of those American slaves their 
lives. There was torture and killing that forced those former American 
slaves' descendents to have to come back to the United States.

Now they are here. They have made their own lives here. And the 
thought that we would have to force them to go back instead of them 
making their own decision as to when to go back. I represent a large 
community of over 17,000 Liberian-Americans. They want to go back to 
Liberia, but they want to make the decision as to when they go back. 
They don't want to have to be forced to go back on October 1 because we 
are forcing them. They have made their lives here. They contribute 
heavily to our community.

In fact, I have spoken this afternoon to several of my constituents. 
One woman, Ms. Harris, has never missed a day of work in the 20 years 
she has been here in this country; another family, the Dennises, who 
have been here; Mr. and Mrs. Akowala. He has two degrees in engineering 
and Mrs. Akowala is a registered nurse.



Both degrees are very important in this country. Both of whom 
contribute heavily to our economy. Their children were born here. But 
if they were forced back and their children are Americans, what 
happens? They go back to a country where 85 percent of the country is 
unemployed, where there's little running water, little electricity. Can 
you imagine what we'd do to that country? It's barely on its feet right 
now. What do we do? We do not stabilize the country that's getting on 
its feet. I think we further destabilize it.

Further, I think the best policy for us to help stand up to Liberia 
is to help and give them the remittances that Americans here in this 
country, the Liberian Americans here send back every year to Liberia. 
And that, I think, is a good policy for this country.

For all of these reasons, not the least of which is Ciehanna Stevens. 
She is married to an Iraqi war veteran hero who's on his fourth tour of 
duty. He's a citizen of this country. He's a Liberian American, fourth 
tour of duty serving his country. She will be deported. Imagine, the 
wife of an Iraqi war hero on his fourth tour of duty to be deported. 
That, to me, is an outrage. We need to pass this bill for all the 
Liberian Americans who contributed to our country.
