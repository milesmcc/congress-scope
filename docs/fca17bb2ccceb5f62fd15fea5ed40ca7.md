# AMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008--
## `fca17bb2ccceb5f62fd15fea5ed40ca7`
`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 24 June 2008`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say on this occasion I almost 
entirely agree with the majority leader about what needs to be 
accomplished this week. We do indeed need to do the housing bill. We do 
indeed need to do the supplemental for the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. The FISA bill, the Medicare fix--it is a complicated 
legislative tangle which my good friend, the majority leader, has 
described, and with which he is trying to deal as we move through the 
week. But my goal is really the same as his, and we are going to 
continue talking to each other, continue to sort of run the traps


and hopefully clear the traps in such a way that we can have a highly 
successful week before the recess.

That is my goal. It is the same as his goal. I will be working with 
him to see if we can get all of those things done in the next few days.
