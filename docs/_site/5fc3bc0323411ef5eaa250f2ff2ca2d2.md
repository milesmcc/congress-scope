Mr. KINGSTON. I have found the same way. I have been to Iraq twice, 
and when I go there to talk to the troops, their biggest enemy is the 
American media. They will tell you it is so frustrating, and they never 
would have believed the media was so bad.

I want to show you some statistics that I think are important because 
you have just been there, but this was a poll that, again, good old 
American media covered up that was actually in Sunday's London Times, a 
British company, the largest poll in the history of Iraq, over 5,000 
people were surveyed.

Now, I think so often when we hear polls that CNN reports, they poll 
their newsroom, 25 people, all whose minds have made up against the war 
and against George Bush. But this was the largest poll in the history 
of the country, largest poll during the war, of over 5,000 people.

They found this: That al-Maliki's, as a Prime Minister, approval 
rating is 49 percent. In September, it was 29 percent. That is a 
significant statistic.

The other thing is we keep hearing that we are caught up in a civil 
war. Well, the flip side is this: It is 70 percent of the people do not 
believe that they are in a civil war.

Now, is it not strange that the Iraqis do not believe they are in a 
civil war, but if you poll the Democrat Members of Congress, I bet you 
90 percent would say they are in a civil war, and yet somehow the folks 
who live there do not believe they are in it. I find that a strange, 
just a very big difference, but, you know, who knows? I mean, we are 
politicians. We know everything. So certainly we know what the Iraqis 
are up to, and maybe they do not.

The other thing that that poll, and it is not on my chart, but the 
other thing that the poll showed is that 66 percent of the people say 
they are better off now than they were under Saddam Hussein, 
conveniently unreported in American news, but I would recommend to you 
all to check out Sunday's London Times.

One other statistic that was not in the poll, but this is just a 
fact. But the month before we started the surge, and the surge 
officially started the 14th of February, the month before, there were 
1,440 civilian casualties. Since that time there have been 265. You 
cannot ignore that statistic.

Now, I also want to give everybody a homework assignment. This is 
just for the folks back home. I would love you guys to see what the 
Democrat leadership says about the bill they are introducing tomorrow. 
Remember, this is a bill that is their official war plan.

Go to www.gop.gov/news/documentsingle, and what do we have? Aspx? 
This, if we can get this on camera, if anybody would come call me, I 
would love you to see the Democrat leadership explaining their plan. I 
am telling you, it is absolutely, it is almost right out of Comedy 
Central. Are they really saying this? Because everything is, well, what 
date y'all call getting out? Well, I do not know, let me ask my 
colleague here. Well, I do not know, let me ask my colleagues. It was 
kind of like, okay, can anybody tell us the capital of Iraq? This is, 
yes, it is on a GOP Web site. That is the only thing partisan about it. 
It is absolutely not touched up one bit.

I want to be sure everybody has an opportunity to look this up, but 
go to www.gop.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx? And ask for the document ID 
is 60396, and if you cannot find it, just call my office and we will 
give it to you, but it is scary. It is on one hand hilarious. On the 
other hand, it is scary that here is a leadership of a party saying 
here is our plan, and they cannot even explain it on prime-time 
television.

I wanted to say the scary part is these are high-stakes stuff, but 
please, look this up and watch this news conference. If you still think 
that this is the right thing to do, well, you are seeing something I am 
not seeing.
