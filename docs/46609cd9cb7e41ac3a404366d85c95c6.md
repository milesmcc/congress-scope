Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq is the front line in the 
war on terror. We know this because the terrorists tell us it is so. In 
poll after poll, the American people tell us they fully believe that 
what happens on the front line in Iraq affects their security every 
single day.

You know, the Democrats have every right to disagree with the 
President's plan, but a nonbinding resolution is not the way to go. It 
sends a message of no confidence and no support to our troops in the 
field, weakening their morale while encouraging and emboldening the 
enemy.

Our men and women in harm's way are fighting the insurgents and they 
are fighting the battle of ideas every day, not only in Iraq but in 30 
different countries around this globe. They know that what we have to 
do is continue to win in that battle, and they don't have time to fight 
the war of public opinion in this country, which is what some of my 
colleagues in this House would seek to have them do.

The Democrats have no alternative plan; they have no way forward. I 
welcome a responsible debate on this war, but let's make sure that we 
keep the focus on encouraging our troops, freedom, prosperity and 
ideas, and that we not encourage those who seek to do us harm.
