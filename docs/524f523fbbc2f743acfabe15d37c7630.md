`Mr. BARRASSO â€” 17 December 2010`

---


Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is indeed a privilege to join my 
friend and colleague, the ranking member of the Armed Services 
Committee. He made mention of the six Christmases he spent away from 
home. Members of this body and of this Nation know that those 
Christmases were spent in captivity as a prisoner of war in North 
Vietnam. I recommend to all of America his book ''Faith of my 
Fathers.'' I read it on a trip with Senator McCain, heading to Iraq to 
visit and thank our troops serving several years ago, on Thanksgiving, 
while we were there with the troops. We were in Baghdad, Kirkuk, and in 
the Anbar Province. I had a chance to meet, for the first time, a young 
marine who was Senator McCain's son.

As we traveled across this globe visiting our soldiers, thanking 
them--in Afghanistan as well--we had been to Georgia, where he was 
awarded and received the highest national award from the President and 
the people of Georgia. Senator McCain is recognized and respected 
worldwide for his knowledge, for his patriotism, and for his bravery. I 
think it is critical that we listen to him as we talk about this very 
important treaty.

The amendment he brings is one to strike the language in the preamble 
that limits our missile defense. It limits our ability as a nation to 
defend ourselves. I have major concerns about the Russians trying to 
limit current and future U.S. missile defense capabilities through the 
New START. I am committed to our national security and the ability of 
the United States to defend ourselves.

In my opinion, this treaty, signed by our President and by the 
Russian President on April 8, 2010, places explicit limits on U.S. 
missile defense.

There should be no place in a treaty with Russia for the United 
States to limit our ability to defend and protect our Nation.

Specifically, I believe the language in the preamble, the language in 
the unilateral statement by Russia the day the treaty was signed, and 
the language in the statements by senior Russian officials regarding 
missile defense--all of them show Russia intends to weaken the ability 
of the United States to defend ourselves.

The language in the preamble provides an explicit linkage between 
strategic nuclear offensive weapons and strategic nuclear defensive 
weapons.

The preamble implies the right of Russia to withdraw from the treaty 
based on U.S. missile defense that is beyond ''current strategic'' 
capabilities. The treaty preamble gives Russia an opportunity to turn 
their backs on the treaty at the slightest sign of a shift in American 
defensive strategy. This language is unacceptable and needs to be 
removed.

Senator McCain read from the Wall Street Journal editorial or op-ed 
by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She pointed out several 
very legitimate concerns about the New START treaty that must be 
resolved during the ratification process.

I wish to repeat and reiterate two sentences that get to the very 
heart of this amendment that Senator McCain and I are bringing to you 
today. She stated:




 . . . the Senate must make absolutely clear that in 


 ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not reestablishing the 


 Cold War link between offensive forces and missile defenses. 


 New START's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it 


 recognizes the ''interrelationship'' of the two.


Suppose the President of Russia is trying to force the United States 
to choose between missile defense and the treaty. In that case, I 
choose missile defense.

The administration continues to claim there is no limit on missile 
defense and that the administration also claims the preamble is not 
legally binding. Well, Russia clearly disagrees and believes the 
opposite to be true. They have made it quite clear they consider the 
preamble to be legally binding.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by Senator McCain 
on the floor. This very year he stated--and I will reiterate it--that 
the treaty contained a ''legally binding linkage between strategic 
offensive and strategic defensive weapons.''

There is a fundamental disagreement between the United States and 
Russia on this issue. I believe that placing constraints on future U.S. 
defense capabilities should not be up for debate, let alone placed in a 
treaty on strategic offensive nuclear weapons.

It is outrageous that this administration would make any concession 
to Russia on our national security. I think the administration's 
decision to include this language was a serious mistake. We should not 
be tying our hands behind our backs and risking the national security 
of both our Nation as well as our allies.

The United States must always remain in charge of our missile 
defense--not Russia or any other country.

As our country continues to face threats from around the world, we 
should not take any action that will hinder our missile defense 
options. With concerns over countries such as Iran and North Korea, the 
United States cannot take any chance on language that could weaken our 
missile defense capabilities. The administration claims the language in 
the preamble has no legally binding significance. Then there should be 
no problem in eliminating that language on missile defense in the 
preamble of the treaty.

That is why I am privileged to join Senator McCain in offering 
amendment No. 4814, and I ask my colleagues to give great thought and 
consideration to what the importance of this amendment is and then go 
on to adopt it.

I yield the floor.
