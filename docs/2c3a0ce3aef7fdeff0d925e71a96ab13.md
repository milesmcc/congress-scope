# FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007
## `2c3a0ce3aef7fdeff0d925e71a96ab13`
`Mr. REID â€” 1 May 2008`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, the work done on this piece of legislation 
to bring it to the floor is a good piece of work. Democrats and 
Republicans worked together to move toward solving one of America's 
major problems, and that is dealing with our aviation system. Chairman 
Rockefeller, Senator Inouye, Senator Baucus, Senator Stevens, Senator 
Grassley, Senator Hutchison, and their staffs understood that ensuring 
the safety and efficiency of America's air traffic is too important to 
fall victim to politics, slow walking, or obstruction. It even appeared 
for a while that this bill was on the path to a relatively smooth and 
easy final passage.

But now our Republican colleagues have signaled that they plan to let 
this bipartisan legislation fall victim to more obstruction. We could 
have moved to the bill yesterday, but the Republicans wouldn't let us 
do that. They forced us to spend more valuable legislative time not 
legislating, not trying to strengthen our country for the American 
people but simply overcoming procedural roadblocks that have been 
thrown at us time after time.



As we have said on a number of occasions, but certainly it is worth 
saying again, Republicans broke the 2-year filibuster record in the 
history of this Senate in just 10 months. We are now up to 68 
filibusters. That is not normal filibustering, it is filibustering on 
steroids.

Democrats want to change our country for the better. We want to 
change the status quo. We have an economy spiraling into recession. Gas 
and oil prices are at a record high. We have the war in Iraq that 70 
percent of the American people want to end. The problems we have faced 
and now face can't be solved easily.

But it would not be solved at all if Republicans refuse to let us 
legislate. The distinguished minority leader raised questions about 
offering amendments to the aviation modernization bill. As I said 
several times yesterday, we welcome their amendments. We want them to 
offer amendments. We understand there is a Bunning amendment dealing 
with turning coal into aviation fuel. I don't know much about that, but 
it is something that appears to be germane and relevant to the bill. We 
should start to debate that amendment. But it appears no matter what I 
suggest, it is obvious the Republicans don't like this bill and are not 
going to let us pass it.

It is my understanding that today they are concerned about at least 
two provisions in the bill. One deals with strengthening the passenger 
rail system we have in America and also doing something about the 
depleted highway trust fund, which is leaving States with no money to 
do road repairs, construction, and modernization. If that is the case, 
it seems to me the logical thing to do is to offer an amendment to take 
those provisions out of the bill.

Long ago, when I was an assemblyman in the Nevada State Legislature, 
it didn't take long to understand that if you don't like something, 
just move to take it out. If you can muster the votes, that works. If 
your amendment doesn't pass, at least everybody knows you have tried. 
Here the Republicans don't even try. They want to just kill things by 
doing nothing.

I told my Republican counterpart that Democrats are making every 
effort we can to allow amendments to be offered. We welcome relevant 
amendments on both sides of the aisle. That is how the legislative 
process is supposed to work. I even offered to the Republican leader 
that we can sit down and let him help me be the gatekeeper of what 
amendments should be offered. That is fair.

Do I want to avoid amendments that have nothing to do with aviation? 
I don't even care much about that. I want to move this bill forward. 
The Republicans' obstruction and claims of unfair dealings are not 
reflective of the facts or reality. I made it clear that the amendment 
process will be fair, open, and take place in the light of day. This 
legislation is far too important to fall victim to the gamesmanship we 
are now seeing. Air travel is about getting from point A to point B, 
such as going from Las Vegas to San Francisco or from San Francisco to 
Chicago. That is what it is about--connecting to family and friends, 
getting goods to businesses, and connecting Americans to the global 
community.

The Federal Aviation Administration is facing challenges like they 
have never faced before. A record 770 million passengers flew on U.S. 
commercial airlines in 2007--nearly double the number who flew just 20 
years ago.

If these trends continue, the FAA told us we will have 1 billion 
passengers in just 12 years.

Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport--the fifth busiest in 
America--now hosts 4 million passengers every month. At this rate, 
McCarran will reach maximum capacity in the next 3 to 5 years.

Every American who flies understands what this new congestion means: 
longer lines, more delays, and a more stressful, less efficient trip.

If growth in air travel in Nevada and throughout America is managed 
correctly, it represents a tremendous opportunity for airlines, 
tourism, and our economy. But the risks we face if we don't bring our 
aviation infrastructure up to speed are clear: Americans could be put 
at greater risk, our economy could suffer, and air travel could grind 
to a halt.

This Aviation Investment Modernization Act will help ensure that we 
manage this growing challenge. It will help passengers take off sooner, 
land safer, help commerce flow with fewer interruptions, and help 
carriers lower their fuel costs--which will save us all money.

The Aviation Investment Act will make air travel safer by upgrading 
aging airport infrastructure, enhancing oversight of airlines and the 
Federal Aviation Administration, and improving runway safety. There was 
an article within the past week that most airline accidents--the close 
calls--are on runways, not in the air.

Right now, the GPS in your car is more sophisticated than the system 
that guides your flight in an airplane. That is why this bill 
modernizes an obsolete air traffic control system with modern 
technology. That is why this bill requires airlines to give passengers 
better information about arrivals and delays. That is why the bill 
incorporates elements of the passenger bill of rights to protect 
consumers and deal with the most egregious flight delays and 
cancellations. That is why this bill does things that make air travel 
safer.

As Americans take to the skies in record numbers, they deserve to 
know the Government is doing everything possible to keep them safe. 
This legislation will give the American people that confidence. It will 
also make flying not only safer but less stressful, more efficient, and 
more enjoyable.

We must not let a crumbling infrastructure grind our economy to a 
halt. That is what it is doing.

I urge my colleagues, once again, to put politics aside, put 
obstruction aside, and work with us to pass the Aviation Investment 
Modernization Act.

Mr. President, if somebody wants to offer an amendment to this bill, 
they can come down and do that. They can play all the political games 
they want, saying: Senator Reid filled the tree. This is something that 
is way inside the beltway, Mr. President. On this vehicle now before 
the Senate, people can offer amendments. All they have to do is come 
and give us an idea of what the amendment is. I have been in the Senate 
a long time, and it is no new theory that you would like to know what 
the amendment is. We always give our amendments to the minority and say 
here is what it is going to be. They should see it firsthand. This does 
not prohibit them from doing that.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
