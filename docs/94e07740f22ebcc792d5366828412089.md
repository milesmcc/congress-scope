Mr. HINCHEY. Anyone who thinks back just a few years would remember 
how this administration and the Members of the Congress who were so 
complicit with them has been able to falsify information and get this 
country into such deep trouble. The situation in Iraq has got to come 
to mind. All of the deep problems we have there, based upon the 
falsification of information. That is what we are seeing here again, 
falsification of information.

The Republicans are alleging that no one wants the oil companies to 
be able to drill for oil offshore when the fact of the matter is that 
the oil companies already have leases on 68 million acres, half 
offshore, half on the dry land of this country, and they are not using 
those 68 million acres.

So what the Republicans want to do, at the request of this White 
House, is to continue to do what this administration has been doing 
since the meeting of Dick Cheney with the heads of the big oil 
companies in this country to continue to have an energy policy that is 
not in the interest of America but in the interest of the big oil 
companies.

What they want them to do is to be able to get more land, more land, 
more public land, and hang on to that public land and not produce 
anything on it.

What we are saying in this bill is use it or lose it. You already 
have the leases on 68 million acres of public land. Start using it. You 
want to drill, start drilling. We want you to drill. Drill on the 
leases that you already have. Don't pretend that you have nothing on 
which you can drill. You have 68 million acres.

What the Republicans want to do is just put more public land in the 
hands of the oil companies so that they can more completely and over a 
longer period of time control all of the energy resources, oil and 
natural gas, that the people of our country own and possess. They want 
the oil companies to possess them for long periods of time, not to use 
them. They are not drilling on what they have.

So pay attention to this bill, and vote for it. Use it or lose it.
