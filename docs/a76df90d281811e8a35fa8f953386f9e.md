Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, let me say, I see the Vice President has 
gone to Iraq to urge the Iraqis not to take a 2-month vacation. I mean, 
we have got to put some pressure on them. It hasn't been working. I 
mean, I see the Vice President also said, he said they seem to be more 
enthused than they used to be. Let me tell you something, we have got 
to do something more than be enthused when the Americans are in the 
killing zone. That's the problem.

If this amendment were adopted, we would lose all our leverage on the 
Iraqis. The Iraqis could go on as they have, and one of the biggest 
problems


we have right now is that every time the Iraqis don't do something, the 
Americans are put in a killing zone.

So I would urge the Members to reject this motion to recommit.
