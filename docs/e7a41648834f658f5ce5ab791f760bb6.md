`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 27 February 2008`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say briefly, the matter before 
us, the Feingold withdrawal amendment is in basically the form it has 
been before us, has been voted on four times before. Each of the times 
it was voted on in the past, one could argue that things were going 
less well in Iraq than they are today. The highest number of votes the 
Feingold withdrawal proposal has received at any point in these 4 votes 
is 29 votes.

It will be, should it be voted on, defeated once again. It certainly 
should be because now we have had 6 months or so of undeniable progress 
on all fronts. The security situation is dramatically improved. Even on 
the political side, where I think Members on both sides were frustrated 
with the new Iraqi democracy, they finally have begun to take the kind 
of steps that are needed--the debaathification law was approved, local 
elections have been scheduled for later in the year.

They are finally making some progress on the Government side as well 
as the undeniable progress on the security side, at this point, not 
brought about strictly by American troops but also the sons of Iraq. 
These people who decided to defend their neighborhoods and defeat, help 
us defeat al-Qaida, have grown dramatically in terms of numbers and 
commitment.

So there is, as I indicated, a lot of interest on our side in 
continuing to at least point out the progress that has been made in 
Iraq, both in terms of security and on the political side. So we will 
have that discussion later into the morning, and the majority leader 
and I will have an opportunity later in the day to discuss where we go 
from here.
