Ms. DeLAURO. I thank the gentleman.

Madam Chairman, I rise to support this amendment because no one 
should receive special privileges under our tax system.

I want to recognize Representative Ellsworth and Congressman Emanuel 
for the hard work on this important issue.

It is unacceptable for the Department of Defense to pay for this war 
by doing business with companies that siphon money from their own 
workers and from their own government. What does it say about our 
Nation and our priorities when American companies like Kellogg, Brown & 
Root, by far the largest contractor in Iraq, are allowed to take their 
Department of Defense dollars, filter them through an offshore shell 
company, all to avoid paying significant Social Security and Medicare 
taxes?

Madam Chairman, we are depleting the Social Security and Medicare 
trust funds by hundreds of millions of dollars, and this amendment says 
that must end--prohibiting Defense Department contractors from using 
foreign shell companies to employ American workers. When tax dodgers 
avoid their responsibilities, the American taxpayers suffers. We cannot 
afford this. Support this amendment.
