Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time.

Mr. Chairman, everyone acknowledges that there is no military 
solution in Afghanistan, only a political solution; but we are putting 
billions of dollars into building up our military presence without a 
clear vision of how to bring our troops home, an exit strategy, for 
lack of a better term. Every military mission has a beginning, a 
middle, a time of transition and an end. But I have yet to see that 
vision articulated in any document, speech or briefing.

We're not asking for an immediate withdrawal. We're surely not 
talking about cutting or running or retreating. Just a plan. If there's 
no military solution for Afghanistan, then please, just tell us how we 
will know when our military contribution to the political solution has 
ended. Requiring an outline for how our military operations are to 
proceed in Afghanistan so that Congress can effectively weigh the level 
of investment, both human and financial, is called doing our job, 
something this body neglected to do throughout the past 8 years.

I welcome the reports, the time frames, the matrixes included in H.R. 
2647. But once again, we're trying to define what the administration 
has failed to articulate for itself. When I first ran for Congress, I 
promised my constituents that I would never, ever send our servicemen 
and -women into a war without a clearly defined mission and a clear 
vision of how we would bring them home safely to their families and to 
their loved ones. I am sticking to that promise. Please support the 
McGovern-Jones-Lee-Pingree amendment.

I yield back the balance of my time.
