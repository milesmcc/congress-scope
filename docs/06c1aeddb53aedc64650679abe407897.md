`Mr. BAYH â€” 4 October 2007`

Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep 
sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Carmel, 
IN. Gerald Cassidy, 31 years old, died September 21 in Fort Knox, KY. 
Gerald was on medical hold after sustaining injuries in Iraq from a 
roadside bomb. With an optimistic future before him, Gerald risked 
everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, 
in a land halfway around the world.

Gerald was a dedicated and longtime member of the Army. In 1992, 
Gerald enlisted in the Army Reserve after spending his summers at 
Culver Military Academy in northern Indiana, where he was named an 
adjutant commander in charge of 85 other academy goers and was a member 
of the Black Horse Troop, an elite equestrian group. In 2003, Gerald 
joined the Indiana National Guard where he was assigned to the 152nd 
Mechanized Infantry. He served in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2004 and in 
Hurricane Katrina Operation Vigilant Relief in 2005. Sgt. Cassidy 
received the Humanitarian Service Medal for his stateside service.

Known at ''G.J.'' to his family, Gerald was a natural leader. He 
volunteered to serve in Iraq with the Minnesota National Guard, who had 
an opening in their team. He was assigned to Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 
150th Field Artillery in Lebanon. For his great service and sacrifice, 
Gerald's family was presented with the Purple Heart, the Combat Action 
Badge and the Indiana Distinguished Service Award. Gerald is survived 
by his wife Melissa Castillo Cassidy; his daughter Abbey, 5 years old; 
his son Isaac, 3 years old; his mother and stepfather John and Kay 
McMullen; his father Gerald J. Cassidy; his sister Lisa Hignite; and 
his brother Darrin Cassidy.

Today, I join Gerald's family and friends in mourning his death. 
While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take 
pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer 
place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will 
remember when they think of Gerald, a memory that will burn brightly 
during these continuing days of conflict and grief. Today and always, 
Gerald will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow 
Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made 
while dutifully serving his country.

As I search for words to do justice in honoring Gerald's sacrifice, I 
am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families 
of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ''We cannot


dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave 
men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far 
above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor 
long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did 
here.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years 
ago, as I am certain that the impact of Gerald's actions will live on 
far longer that any record of these words.

It is my sad duty to enter the name of Gerald J. Cassidy in the 
Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his 
profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about 
this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that 
comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Gerald's 
can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ''He will 
swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from 
off all faces.''

May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be 
with all of you, as I know He is with Gerald.
