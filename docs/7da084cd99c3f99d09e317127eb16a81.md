Mr. KUCINICH. In a few short days, this Congress will make a 
momentous decision as to whether or not to fund the continuation of the 
war in Iraq. And yet, at this time, the American people clearly want 
our troops brought home. Funding the war will keep the troops there. 
Stopping the funding will enable us to bring them home.

Barbara Lee has an amendment that will fund the orderly return of our 
troops. I have offered H.R. 1234, which is compatible with the Lee 
amendment. The money is there right now in the pipeline to bring the 
troops home. Once we bring the troops home or a plan is put forth to 
bring the troops home, we have to have a plan to stabilize Iraq. That's 
what H.R. 1234 will do.

This Congress cannot stand by as the casualties pile up. We have to 
remember that the families of the troops are waiting for us to take 
action. Let's act now. Support the Lee amendment and support H.R. 1234.
