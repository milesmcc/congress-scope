Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in a few hours we will be 
listening to the President provide us with a road map for the State of 
the Union. I ask the President as he comes to this House and this place 
to recognize that we are in this together and we look forward to 
working together.

But it certainly should be part of the conscience of this body and of 
America that our soldiers remain in serious jeopardy, not because they 
have not done their job, but because we have not done ours.

When soldiers can be dressed in semi-American uniforms and wage 
attacks on unsuspecting U.S. military, we have a problem.

Mr. Speaker, I am asking for a serious consideration of the cutting 
of funds to this war in terms of its plus-up, a new direction, and a 
political diplomatic approach allowing Iraq to provide its own security 
with our technical support.

It is now time to celebrate the heroes of our military and to bring 
our soldiers home. I look forward to the message on the State of the 
Union.
