Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, what do our international friends know that 
the Bush administration doesn't?

It seems everywhere you turn, the ''Coalition of the Willing'' is 
concluding it is time to get out of Iraq, while the Bush administration 
wants to send 21,500 more U.S. troops.

Just last week our biggest ally in the Iraq war, Britain, announced 
that it was withdrawing 1,600 troops from Iraq in the coming months. 
The same day Denmark said it, too, would pull out all of its 460 troops 
by the end of the summer. And then South Korea decided that 1,100 of 
its 2,300 troops would be withdrawn from Iraq in April, with the rest 
following later this year.

With this news, the ''Coalition of the Willing'' is no longer so 
willing, dwindling to about 10,000 troops. What is it that these 
countries know that the Bush administration still can't figure out?

Could it be that they see the writing on the wall; that they have 
concluded, as many others have here in the United States, that the Iraq 
war can no longer be won militarily?

Mr. Speaker, our dwindling coalition should serve as another wake-up 
call to the Bush administration that it is time for a new direction in 
Iraq.
