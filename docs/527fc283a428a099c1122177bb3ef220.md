Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairman, what this amendment says is this: Excuse 
me, Mr. And Mrs. Iraqi. Hey, we're here permanently. That's the message 
that this amendment sends. And I doubt if there are many households in 
Baghdad or Tikrit or anywhere else that will read this amendment. But 
they'll get the message, should this amendment pass. The message is, 
Mr. And Mrs. Iraqi, we're here forever.

We can't do that. I oppose this amendment.

Madam Chairman, I yield back my time.
