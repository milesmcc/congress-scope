Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Well, there are obviously needs in addition to Iraq that are being 
discussed, and I would tell my friend that those discussions are 
ongoing. A decision on what may or may not be added in addition to the 
supplemental that may be necessary for Iraq, there may be other things, 
that decision has not been made at this point in time. But I do want to 
let the gentleman know that that is under discussion.

As the gentleman will recall, last year, when we passed the 
supplemental, there were domestic priorities that were also addressed, 
in particular, Katrina, as the gentleman will recall, and some other 
matters as well. So, that's under discussion.
