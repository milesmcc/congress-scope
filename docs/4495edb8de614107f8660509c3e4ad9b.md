Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, today, we have learned of the passing of 
two of America's finest soldiers when an improvised explosive device 
exploded in Afghanistan. Killed was Private First Class Kimble Han or 
Lehi, Utah, as well as Eric Lembke of Tampa Bay, Florida.

Madam Speaker, I hope we will all pause to give thanks to the men and 
women who have served in our Armed Forces and that we remember their 
families and friends.

May God bless these fine soldiers, and may God bless the United 
States of America.
