Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment 
offered by the gentlelady from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).

Mr. Chairman, this amendment has a noble purpose, to draw attention 
to the potential erosion of the social and economic progress that has 
benefited women throughout Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban.

Many of us in Congress have remained focused on key areas addressed 
in the Afghan National Development Strategy, the basis of the 
Afghanistan Compact, which are vital for building human capital and 
creating an enabling environment for promoting equal rights and 
opportunities for women in that country.

We have also focused on ensuring the development and application of 
sustainable strategies that invest in Afghanistan's human capital, 
equipping both Afghani women and men with the skills, the support, and 
the resources needed to move their country forward into peace and 
stability.

Furthermore, we have repeatedly expressed our commitment to Afghan 
political, economic and social development and promoting the 
participation of women and, indeed, all Afghans in these processes.

I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.

I yield back the balance of my time.
