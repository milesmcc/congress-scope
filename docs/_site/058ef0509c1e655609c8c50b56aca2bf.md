`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 29 March 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Ryan, I am glad you are here to make that 
point, because we talked about it earlier.

Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for us to understand exactly, 
and I can see if it was a different President, Mr. Ryan. I can see if 
the administration has changed from the last Congress to this one. But 
it is the same President that celebrated a Congress that was willing to 
follow through his original thoughts.

During our watch on the 109th Congress and the 108th Congress, the 
President signed bills with billions of dollars in special interest tax 
breaks and subsidies to big oil, to a number of other high-level, 
connected, plugged-in, I-know-them kind of folks, and direct access to 
the Capitol and direct access to the White House, signed a bill and 
didn't even blink an eye.



And in this emergency supplemental which is a true emergency, our men 
and women need what they need now in the field, not in 2 or 3 weeks, 
now.

The real issue is we are helping and correcting the lack of 
oversight, the lack of will and the desire to correct the issues at 
Walter Reed Hospital which, when our troops are injured in the field, 
some of them, and Mr. Ryan and I have been through the whole track of 
what happens to our men and women that are injured in the field. They 
are dealt with in the field hospital, then shipped over to Germany. 
They spend some time over there, and then they are medevaced over here 
to Walter Reed Hospital. The last thing they need to see is a broken-
down, lights-out, insect-infested Walter Reed Hospital. We responded.

As a matter of fact, it makes me feel so good with this new 
Democratic Congress that we have here now, prior to the Walter Reed 
story coming out, and I need to get my chart on Walter Reed, prior to 
the Walter Reed story coming out, this Congress, through the continuing 
resolution that we passed at the end of January, because the rubber 
stamp worked on some days, the 109th Congress did not finish the 
appropriations bills, we reprioritized their priorities and put $3.6 
billion in into VA health care.

Here is a specialist here. She lost her legs. She lost her legs 
because this country asked her to go and fight in a foreign land, in 
Iraq.

This whole story here, the Newsweek cover, and Newsweek comes out 
every week, but I actually saved this. I save a number of Newsweek, 
Time and other periodicals and dailies so we can archive what has 
happened in the past so we can have a better future.

Right now what we are doing in the emergency supplemental is a better 
future for the very people we are trying to help. For the President to 
say, well, I am concerned about other things that are in the bill.

Well, he wasn't concerned when it was okay for big oil. He wasn't 
concerned about that. I am so glad we live in a democracy, and I am 
able to say this. I am very concerned. You know why I am concerned? 
Because there are some American people who woke up early one Tuesday 
and stood in line and voted for some representation.

Mr. Speaker, as sure as my name is Kendrick Meek, they are going to 
get it from this Congress. They are going to get representation from 
this Congress. We are going to make sure that their values are turned 
into not only law but to action.

Mr. Ryan, when you talk about this issue of what is in the bill, what 
is actually in the emergency supplemental, when we talk about the 
accountability measures, you can't help but get passionate about it.

Mr. Speaker, if I was an intern working in a congressman's office and 
if he or she voted against the emergency supplemental, my American 
spirit would have to come out. I would say I love the congressman or 
congresswoman, but it is the right thing to do.

So what is the problem? Maybe they need to send an e-mail. Maybe they 
need to send out an e-mail under the name John Doe or something saying, 
Mr. President, I love you and all of this, but please don't veto this 
bill. That is where we are now.
