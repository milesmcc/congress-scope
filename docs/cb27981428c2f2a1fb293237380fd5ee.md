# IRAQ RESOLUTION
## `cb27981428c2f2a1fb293237380fd5ee`
`Mr. WILSON of Ohio â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the Iraq resolution that we are 
debating here is bipartisan. Over the last 2 days, Democrats and 
Republicans have come to this floor to voice their opposition about the 
escalation plan for this war.

There is also strong bipartisan support for a resolution in the 
Senate that would express the Chamber's opposition to the President's 
plan there. Unfortunately, Senate Republican leaders are preventing the 
debate and the resolution, preferring instead to blindly follow the 
President.

Why have Democrats and Republicans come together to express our 
opposition to the President's plan? Unlike the President, we have 
listened to the military experts, his own generals, the American 
people, the troops fighting in Iraq, and the bipartisan Iraq Study 
Group that said this war no longer can be won militarily.

Congress must express an opinion to this President's plan. Over the 
last month, the House and Senate committees have conducted 52 hearings 
on Iraq, conducting oversight of an administration that is off course 
internationally. The oversight will continue and we will bring a change 
of course in Iraq
