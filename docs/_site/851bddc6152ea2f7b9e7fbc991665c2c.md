Mr. SALAZAR. I can think of no more important priority for all of us. 
As we deal with issues of crime and violence and the rule of law in 
places far away such as Iraq and Afghanistan, it ought to be an 
important priority, a high priority for us to make sure we are 
enforcing the rule of law and providing security for Americans at home; 
that we take care of the homeland first.

I strongly agree with the Senator from Maryland that, in fact, this 
bill moves us in that direction.
