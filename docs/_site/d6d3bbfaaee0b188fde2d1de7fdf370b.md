Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory and honor of 
Lance Corporal Daniel R. Scherry. He served our country courageously 
until his death on April 16, 2007. His brief but passionate career is 
an inspiration to the community and the brave Marines who continue to 
fight.

Daniel, born in Cleveland, was a graduate of Rocky River High School. 
He was an invaluable member of the varsity football team, where his 
determination and leadership helped the Pirates transform into a 
dominant football team. Daniel's presence extended off the playing 
field as he continued to mentor the students of his alma mater before 
he was deployed to Iraq.

After his graduation in 2005, Daniel continued to be an active member 
of the community and enrolled himself as a student at the Tri-C Fire 
Academy. He received hands-on training and underwent intensive classes 
that fueled his desire to serve our country. In April 2006, Daniel 
fulfilled his dream and enlisted in the Marine Corps.

In September, Daniel was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine 
Regiment, Regimental Combat Team 2 of the 2nd Marine Division, II 
Marine Expeditionary Force in Camp Lejeune, NC. Daniel served as an 
infantry mortar man and his diligence and hard work did not go 
unnoticed. Within his first year of duty, Daniel was quickly promoted 
twice to the level of Lance Corporal.

Lance Corporal Daniel Scherry is survived, but greatly missed by his 
parents, siblings, and extended family.

Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join me in honoring serviceman 
Lance Corporal Daniel Scherry. He is an American hero and his sacrifice 
will always be remembered by the lives he touched.
