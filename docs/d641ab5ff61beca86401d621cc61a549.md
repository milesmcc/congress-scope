Mr. McINTYRE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of the 
33rd anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which occurred on 
July 20, 1974. Many lost their lives and livelihoods as a result of 
that invasion. It is disappointing that 33 years later the island of 
Cyprus remains divided and contentious.

A United Nations Security Council resolution states ''a Cyprus 
settlement must be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty 
and international personality and a single citizenship, with its 
independence and territorial integrity safeguarded and comprising two 
politically equal communities as described in the relevant Security 
Council resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation and that 
such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other 
country or any form of partition or secession.'' I look forward to the 
day when such a settlement is realized.

Cyprus has been a staunch ally of the United States. It has aided our 
efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq by allowing the United States over-
flight and landing rights, as well as port access for our ships. In 
addition, Cyprus provided valuable assistance for our evacuation and 
rescue efforts after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing and the 2006 
hostilities in Lebanon.

Also, it is important that we ensure the protection of human rights 
in Cyprus and work to preserve the Cypriots' religious and cultural 
heritage. I am troubled by reports that religious sites, including 
Greek Orthodox churches, have been pillaged, destroyed, or in any way 
harmed.

I am encouraged that efforts are underway to facilitate the 
integration of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, specifically the opening of 
crossing points on this divided island. After 33 years of division and 
contention, it is time to reach a just and lasting peace that will 
unify Cyprus and allow it to grow politically, socially, and 
economically. I encourage my colleagues to support any efforts to reach 
such a settlement.
