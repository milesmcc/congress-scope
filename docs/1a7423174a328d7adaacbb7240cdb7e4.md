Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share one of the many 
stories of bravery from our Armed Forces stationed in Iraq. I want to 
tell you about Navy Petty Officer Dustin Kirby, a native of Hiram, 
Georgia, a skilled Navy corpsman attached to the 2nd Marine Division in 
Iraq.

Petty Officer Kirby was injured by sniper fire outside of Fallujah on 
Christmas Day. I had the honor of visiting him and his family at 
Bethesda Naval Hospital earlier this week, and I was deeply moved by 
his courage and dedication to the defense of our Nation.

From my visit, it was clear Petty Officer Kirby had touched many 
lives. In fact, while we visited he got a phone call from his fellow 
troops overseas.

His wife, Lauren, his parents, Jack and Gail, his brother and sister, 
all shared with me their praise of his bravery and resolve.

Mr. Speaker, it is because of soldiers like Petty Officer Dustin 
Kirby that I know we will achieve victory in Iraq. The dedication and 
determination of our Armed Forces is what protects our Nation every day 
and what will ultimately help deliver security and freedom in the 
Middle East.

I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Petty Officer Kirby 
for his service.
