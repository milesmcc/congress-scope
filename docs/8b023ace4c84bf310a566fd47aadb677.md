Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor America's brave men 
and women currently serving in the name of freedom and to oppose this 
resolution of retreat.

As Abraham Lincoln said famously in his second inaugural address: 
''Fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily 
pass away.'' As Americans we are reluctant warriors, but throughout our 
rich history, whenever our troops have been in


harm's way America has supported the men and women in uniform and made 
certain our troops have the necessary resources to accomplish their 
mission.

Without a doubt, mistakes have been made, and these mistakes are 
important to acknowledge, but we must go forward with a new strategy in 
Iraq based on quantifiable goals and measurable results. We must not 
retreat. At this critical time, the American people long for true 
leadership and resolve.

I urge my colleagues to put aside political posturing and 
partisanship and ensure our troops have the resources and support 
needed to complete this mission. Victory is the only option.
