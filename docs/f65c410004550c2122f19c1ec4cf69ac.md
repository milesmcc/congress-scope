Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, one of the things we 
really need to make sure of is that the American public as they watch 
this Blue Dog Coalition group here talk tonight, every one of us to the 
''T'' comes from rural areas basically. We love America, we love our 
troops, we visit them.

I have been to Iraq five times and Afghanistan twice. I went for a 
reason, to tell our troops thank troops thank you, we love you, we 
appreciate you. We pray that an umbrella of safety will be put over our 
troops. We work for those back home to be sure that their families are 
recognized and that our communities uphold them and undergird them.

I don't want anybody to have a misinterpretation of what we are 
saying here tonight. This is about America, and it is not about TV ads 
that try to justify a war going on in Iraq. I am ashamed those things 
are on TV. We support our troops, and we will continue to do that.
