`Mr. SERRANO â€” 28 June 2007`

---


Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I just want to, first of all, 
comment that I must have hit a nerve in telling the truth, because the 
gentleman from Georgia got so excited that he made some noise that I'm 
trying to figure out later what it means. Something, hee-haw or haw-hee 
or


something. I'll try to figure it out later.

But anyway, the point is that no one is lecturing anyone. The ones 
who've been doing lecturing, Mr. Chairman, have been people saying that 
these bills have to be cut. These bills are bare-bone bills. This one 
in particular came in under the President's request, cut the 
President's request by $245 million.

We set out to help agencies to help people. We demand, we encourage 
them, actually, to come closer to the people. We do a lot to allow the 
District of Columbia to deal with some of its issues, something that 
Mr. Regula and I believe in strongly. That's what this bill does.

But we still can't get away from the fact that when we deal with 
cuts, you could present it any way you want. There's only one cut where 
the American people will actually feel something happening, and that is 
if you cut this continued ability to allow only the richest people in 
the country, the millionaires and the zillionaires to get incredible 
tax cuts where they take home 160,000 more dollars than they took last 
year, or 220,000 more dollars than they took home last year; or if you 
ever get the courage to say to President Bush, this is your war, you 
started this war, we have to end the pain of the war, but in the 
process, we have to end the continuing waste. And I say waste, because 
it shouldn't have been there in the first place, of half a trillion 
dollars. That's a lot of money.

Cutting the Consumer Product Safety Commission, cutting the FCC, 
cutting the SEC, cutting the Small Business Administration, that's not 
going to make a difference, and you know it.

Let's have the courage to tell the President to get out of Iraq and 
save half a trillion dollars that he will now spend if we stay there, 
and then we're talking real dollars.

I hope that everybody will oppose this amendment.

I yield back the balance of my time.
