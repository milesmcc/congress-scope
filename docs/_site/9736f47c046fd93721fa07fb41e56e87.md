Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I hope the American public sees the irony in 
the votes that we are going to take this afternoon and evening. Before 
us now we are going to take a vote to pull out of Iraq immediately. 
Then, right after that, we are going to take a vote to fund the troops 
so they can stay a while.

So I guess the only difference between the House Democrats today and 
Senator Kerry a year ago, where he voted for Iraq before he voted 
against Iraq, is that our friends get to do it all in the same day.

Now, the other irony that I thought was interesting today is that we 
had a visitor, the deputy prime minister of Iraq, that was coming here 
with a message of what is really going on in Iraq. And he met with a 
group of us this morning in HC-9, separated only by a thin wall to the 
caucus that was occurring with our friends from the other side of the 
aisle where they were plotting the strategy of how to get out of Iraq.

I think it shows one of the differences between the two parties where 
we are meeting with the government officials on how to get them stood 
up, how do we strengthen the government there so they can take over 
their own operations without falling to the al Qaeda; at the same time, 
our friends are plotting on the other side to pull out and abandon 
them.

I think the day is just full of ironies, and I hope that the general 
public gets to see those today.
