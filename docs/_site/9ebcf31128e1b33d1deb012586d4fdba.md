Mr. McCONNELL. Now, to the testimony on the Iraq war in committees 
today. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will be here, as we all 
know. This is an eagerly anticipated update on political and military 
progress being made in Iraq.

Less than a year after our counterinsurgency plan went into full 
effect, we have been getting a steady flow of positive reports on the 
security situation in Iraq. Overall violence in Iraq is down. Civilian 
deaths are down. Sectarian killing is down. Attacks on American forces 
are down. As a result, thousands of U.S. troops have already begun to 
come back home.

Another measure of the Petraeus plan's success is the dramatic 
increase in Iraqi security forces since the full implementation of the 
counterinsurgency strategy last June. Between December 2007 and last 
month, Iraqi security forces have increased by more than 40,000, 
bringing the total number to more than 530,000. This includes 141,000 
assigned soldiers and officers and a police force of 347,000 strong. 
Over the last year, the so-called surge of Iraqi security forces has 
been three or four times larger than our own surge. As we stand here, 
the Iraqi security forces continue to expand, with young Iraqis signing 
up for local police forces to protect the border and for special 
operations.

As the Iraqis take over more of their own security needs, Congress 
can help by passing a supplemental appropriations bill that has been on 
request for more than a year. These funds are also needed to ensure the 
combat readiness of the force and our forces over in Afghanistan as 
well.

Increased security in Iraq has led to political progress in Iraq. 
Although significant benchmarks remain unmet, progress on other 
significant benchmarks that seemed far off a few months ago is now 
underway. These include such things as passage and approval of 
debaathification legislation, an amnesty law, and measures leading to 
greater centralization of the Iraqi security forces. It is also worth 
noting the Iraq Government has started to meet more of its own 
expenses, including three-fourths of the costs of its security forces 
and a new jobs program.

The success of General Petraeus's strategy is the best reason we have 
for listening closely to his advice as we move forward. Last August, he 
said security and local political progress will enable us to reduce the 
number of U.S. troops to presurge levels, and we have reason to hope 
the progress that has been made, both politically and in security, 
will, in fact, lead to a reduction in troop levels.

But General Petraeus has a better grasp than most on whether the 
gains we have seen are secure enough for a full reduction to begin. For 
the sake of our long-term security, we should listen very closely to 
what he has to say.

When Democrats on the campaign trail tout their plans for Iraq and 
Afghanistan, they often cite the need to listen to the generals. The 
junior Senator from New York likes to say one of her first actions as 
President would be to convene the Joint Chiefs of Staff to help her 
draw up a plan for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. If military 
advice is needed to draw up plans for withdrawal, shouldn't it be 
important to draw up plans for success?

Our friends on the other side are rightly concerned about military 
readiness. I share their concern. But the best way to ensure the 
military's readiness is not to scrap a plan that has been working in 
Iraq. The best way to improve readiness is to approve the Defense 
supplemental without arbitrary dates for withdrawal and to fully fund 
the 2009 Defense appropriations bill.



As most Americans, I am eager to hear what General Petraeus and 
Ambassador Crocker have to say about the military and political 
progress in Iraq. These men have spent literally decades mastering 
their respective professional fields. They deserve our respect, and 
over the last year they have earned our admiration. I know we will all 
welcome them and give them the fair hearing they have earned and that 
this all-important mission certainly deserves.

I yield the floor.
