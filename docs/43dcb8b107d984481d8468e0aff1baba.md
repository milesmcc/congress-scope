Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleague in support of S. 793, the 
Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008. This legislation reauthorizes 
important grant programs, which assist States, territories, and the 
District of Columbia in establishing and expanding coordinated services 
of community-based services and support for those with traumatic brain 
injuries.

Traumatic brain injuries, TBI, can happen to anyone, and occur when 
someone experiences brain damage from externally inflicted trauma to 
the head. While these injuries can impact children, teenagers and 
adults, TBI has been described as the signature wound of the war in 
Iraq.

This legislation, first authorized in 1996, was reauthorized in 2000. 
With the large number of troops returning from the battlefield 
afflicted by this injury, it is important that we continue the 
activities authorized by this legislation.

The bill ensures that we are working to improve treatment through 
research at the National Institutes of Health and are able to gather 
information about the incidence of TBI and the prevalence of TBI-
related disability.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important effort.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
