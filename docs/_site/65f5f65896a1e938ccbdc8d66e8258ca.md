`Ms. PELOSI â€” 5 March 2008`

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for 
her leadership in bringing the rule to the floor, which will enable us 
to debate legislation that is very important to many people in America. 
I thank Mr. Pallone for his leadership on the committee of 
jurisdiction, a House subcommittee of Energy and Commerce, and I thank 
Mr. Hastings as well for the opportunity to debate this important 
issue.

This is a very special day in the Congress of the United States. We 
are all very proud of our work, but there are some days that really 
stand out as historic, days that represent breakthroughs for America's 
families.

Today we are debating an issue that is relevant to the lives of so 
many people in our country. And we owe a great debt of gratitude to two 
of our colleagues, Congressman Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and 
Congressman Ramstad of Minnesota, for their great knowledge of the 
issue of mental illness and addiction, for their political astuteness 
of the political process here, and for their generosity of spirit to 
share their personal experience with us, to use their knowledge of 
issues relating to mental illness and addiction to benefit so many 
people in our country. It is painful, I know, and therefore very 
courageous of them to do so. And simply said, without their leadership, 
we would not have this opportunity today. So I am pleased to salute the 
leadership of Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Ramstad. With this 
legislation, they have given hope to millions of Americans.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation also because 
illness of the brain must be treated just like illness anywhere else in 
the body. The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act is 
a comprehensive bill to help end discrimination against those who seek 
treatment for mental illness.

There is no shame in mental illness. The great shame would be if 
Congress did not take action to ensure that individuals with mental 
health illnesses and addictions are given the attention, treatment, and 
resources they need to lead a healthy life.

This is an issue of national significance. Did you know, and I found 
the figure startling, every year mental illness results in 1.3 billion 
lost days of work or school; 1.3 billion days. That adds up to more 
lost productivity for mental illness than arthritis, stroke, heart 
attack, and cancer combined. Combined. Yet bipartisan and independent 
research shows that there is no significant cost to insuring mental 
illness like any other medical disease.

This legislation will be especially relevant for our returning 
veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who later become employed in the 
private sector. This will be potentially life-saving for those brave 
men and women who served in the National Guard and Reserves but who 
don't receive VA care for their entire lifetime.

Mr. Speaker, to help remove the stigma against mental illness, for 
the millions suffering from mental illness and addiction, and because 
it is the right thing for our Nation, I urge my colleagues to support 
the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. It is 
legislation that is long overdue. It gives hope to millions of people 
in our country and their families.

I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and honor the 
leadership, the courage, the generosity of spirit of Mr. Kennedy and 
Mr. Ramstad in making this day possible for us.
