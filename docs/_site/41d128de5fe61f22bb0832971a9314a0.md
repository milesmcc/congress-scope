Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, success in Afghanistan 
should be defined in the tradition of Ronald Reagan: we win and the 
terrorists lose.

While his decision was long overdue, I was pleased the President 
announced sending 30,000 reinforcements to Afghanistan. The President 
has listened to our commanders on the ground for a counterinsurgency to 
secure Afghanistan, which protects American families. This decision 
will defeat al Qaeda terrorists and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Along 
the border with Pakistan, U.S. troops are denying al Qaeda and Taliban 
safe havens in which to operate.

For the sake of our mission, American families at home, and our brave 
men and women in uniform, I hope the President will rally congressional 
leaders behind his strategy and our troops' mission for victory in 
Afghanistan. Supporting the President's decision shouldn't come down to 
party lines. Terrorists do not differentiate between Republicans and 
Democrats as targets.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
