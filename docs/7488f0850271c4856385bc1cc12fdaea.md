Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3087) to require the President, in coordination with the 
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to 
Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States 
Armed Forces in Iraq, as amended.
