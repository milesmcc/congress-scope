Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq is in its fifth year, but the 
Bush administration still refuses to develop a realistic, strategic 
plan for the Middle East and Iraq.

The Iraq War has destabilized the region, and the United States must 
reassert and protect its fundamental national security interests by 
actively taking the necessary steps to stabilize the Middle East.

Today Congress will debate a plan which stands in stark contrast to 
the delusional policies of the Bush administration which have sapped 
our military readiness, strengthened al Qaeda, wasted our resources and 
betrayed the trust of the American people.

There is a way forward, and we must be bold, courageous and 
strategic. Without leadership in the White House, we must continue to 
exercise leadership in the people's House. And I assure the American 
people that we will.
