# NAFTA AND THE DRUG TRADE
## `e8c3804dbcd44c7b1a9a4cdb9df813ce`
`Ms. KAPTUR â€” 23 January 2007`

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this evening we are going to listen to the 
President of the United States, and I have no doubt in the State of the 
Union he will talk about the war on terrorism, and he will talk about 
the need to create jobs in Iraq to stabilize the terrible situation 
there, and he will talk about more funds for reconstruction of Iraq. 
Our Nation has already spent over $500 billion and rising in that sad 
country.

But I would like to focus on the United States just for a second, if 
I could, and talk about the terrorism focused inside of this country 
and point out that 90 percent of all the drugs that are smuggled into 
this country enter through our border with Mexico, and that is 
according to our State Department. In fact, under NAFTA, the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, which his father negotiated, drug and 
drug-related smuggling across the Mexican border has risen to over $142 
billion a year, according to our Drug Enforcement Agency.



Every single community in our country is affected, not just border 
communities. Every single jail, every single sheriff, every single law 
enforcement official, every single prison. Our communities are infected 
with burglaries, with robberies, with personal assaults related to the 
abuse of drugs in our country. I will be very interested to see what 
the President has to say about that war on terrorism tonight that 
affects every single neighborhood in this country.

NAFTA brings a significant increase in cargo traffic across our 
southern border and thus strains the enforcement efforts of our border 
patrols and enables traffickers and terrorists. In fact, 9,300 
commercial trucks cross our border daily. 9,300 more trucks. And do you 
know how many we inspect? Five percent. Five percent. So there is a 95 
percent chance for smugglers who are out there, whatever they want to 
get into this country, that will be their rate of success.

Now, the Mexican Government is working very hard to build a four-lane 
highway which they call La Entrada al Pacifico, the Entrance from the 
Pacific. And the idea there would be to redirect so much of the traffic 
from Asia, from China, these big ships that are bound for the United 
States, from the west coast, Ports of Los Angeles and Oakland, further 
south, and stretch the actual shipping lanes into Mexico versus the 
United States. It is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the truck 
traffic will also be diverted from California and El Paso to the ports 
of entry at Presidio.

The idea is that the highway into our country would begin further 
south where goods would come in in deepwater ports, and the completed 
route would save up to 4 shipping days for goods moving between the 
Pacific Rim countries and Texas, which would be one of the major ports 
of entry into our country.

The problem is that we really haven't addressed the issue of drug 
smuggling as a part of this. Ninety percent, again, of all drugs 
smuggled into this country come over the Mexican border. That area has 
become almost lawless. Hundreds of murders related to drug trafficking 
go unaddressed both on the Mexican side of that border and our side. We 
really need to have a border enforcement organization that is 
negotiated by treaty by amending NAFTA in order that we can have proper 
enforcement along that very porous part of our country which makes us 
so vulnerable.

Our border guards are overwhelmed. We know that pedestrian traffic 
has increased by 55 percent across that border, according to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, and all kinds of vehicular traffic. Can you 
imagine that one place on that border accounts for 70 to 90 percent of 
the cocaine sold in the United States smuggled through that region? In 
fact, the drug cartels have moved up their major source of operation in 
Colombia up to the state of Juarez, and now control the state of Juarez 
just south of the State of Texas. This is real terrorism poised at our 
country.

Let's say the people in the Middle East want to get something into 
the United States. You mean to tell me they haven't thought about this? 
Of course they have. And we know that drug presence leads to more 
violence and more corruption at every level.

An unreleased Drug Enforcement Agency report notes that drugs, 
weapons, people traffickers, and terrorist organizations have to cross 
the border from Mexico into the United States, and they will use one of 
the many corridors available to them. I hope that the President of the 
United States tonight talks about securing our southern border.

Crossroads of Conflict--World Trade Bridge Has Changed the U.S.-Mexico 












Border, for Good and Bad














(By Sara A. Carter)




 Laredo, Texas.--The mammoth globe on the World Trade Bridge 


 spins in the glow of the Texas moon, welcoming hundreds of 


 cargo trucks from Mexico to the United States' largest inland 


 port.



 Nighttime is the slowest time for the bridge.



 During the day, literally thousands of trucks cross the 


 span into the U.S., headed for destinations scattered 


 throughout the Midwest and East and north into Canada.



 Traffic between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, on Mexico's side 


 of the bridge, is only expected to increase in coming years 


 with Mexico anticipating billions of dollars in new trade, 


 mainly from China, on its way to the United States, according 


 to a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration executive summary.



 Increasing trade has, however, been matched by growth in 


 corruption and death in both border cities, though U.S. and 


 Mexican officials are loathe to admit it.



 $142 billion in drug trade between the U.S. and Mexico, 


 according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.



 86,000 Transportation jobs created as a result of the World 


 Trade Bridge.



 9,300 Commercial trucks pass through the World Trade Bridge 


 daily.



 90% of all drugs smuggled into the United States enter 


 through its border with Mexico.



 The prospect of expanded trade in Mexican states controlled 


 by some of the country's most dangerous cartel leaders could 


 pose serious national security challenges for the United 


 States, an internal DEA report obtained by the Daily Bulletin 


 explains.



 The report, which has never been released, examines how 


 already strained federal law enforcement agencies monitoring 


 border security and narcotics will be challenged by not only 


 Mexican and South and Central American drug trafficking 


 organizations, but also by Asian cartels.



 With slim resources to monitor cargo and inadequate border 


 security measures in place, it will be next to impossible for 


 U.S. agencies to stem the tide of contraband expected to 


 enter the country from Mexico, the DEA report warns. Agencies 


 will be hard-pressed to monitor the billions of dollars in 


 contraband expected to enter the nation if U.S. officials 


 don't take heed.



 ''Contraband can be anything from narcotics, pirated 


 videos, humans or weapons of mass destruction,'' said David 


 Monnette, spokesman for the DEA in EI Paso, Texas. ''These 


 drug trafficking organizations know that we are spread thin, 


 and many times they use legitimate trade routes to move their 


 contraband into the United States.




 This report explains the possible dangers of not addressing 


 these issues.''

















Trade route




 A joint venture of Texas and the Mexican government, La 


 Entrada al Pacifico (Gateway to the Pacific) which also is 


 the title of the DEA report is meant to get more goods from 


 Asia north into the United States.



 The plan which involves redirecting more than half of East 


 Coast-bound Asian cargo from the ports of Long Beach and Los 


 Angeles to Mexico will stretch the power of Mexican cartels 


 while aligning them with Asian drug-trafficking 


 organizations, according to the DEA report. That report 


 focuses on the Mexican port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa, on 


 Mexico's southwestern coast.



 But Topolobampo has taken a back seat during the past year 


 to another port, Lazaro Cardenas, just 72 hours from Laredo.



 Lazaro Cardenas, the deepest container port on the Pacific, 


 is in southern Mexico, in Michoacan. The volume of re-routed 


 trade through it is expected to explode within the next four 


 years.



 And that's troubling to U.S. authorities.



 ''The (plan) represents an expanding threat to the U.S. for 


 drug, weapon and alien smuggling, as well as related crime, 


 through a 260-mile stretch of Texas into the heartland of the 


 U.S.,'' the report states. ''(Drug trafficking organizations) 


 will be able to exploit the new corridor through the use of 


 established smuggling networks and associations with Mexican 


 drug trafficking organizations.



 ''They may evade U.S. law enforcement under the guise of 


 the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and use 


 established Asian communities in the U.S. for the 


 distribution of drugs.''
















 Piggy-backing




 Ninety percent of all non-domestic narcotics enter the U.S. 


 through the Mexican border, according to a 2005 U.S. State 


 Department report.



 Drugs are a multibillion-dollar industry for cartels in 


 Latin America. The National Drug Intelligence Center 


 conservatively estimates more than $108 billion roughly equal 


 to the combined gross domestic product of Ecuador and 


 Guatemala in drugs comes into the U.S. yearly. The U.S. Drug 


 Enforcement Administration puts the figure at $142 billion in 


 drug trade just between the U.S. and Mexico. Other estimates 


 soar even higher.



 ''NAFTA has made smuggling drugs across the border easier 


 by several means,'' including via cargo trucks, the DEA 


 report notes. ''The volume of truck traffic coming across the 


 border necessitates the expediting of inspections to the 


 point that few trucks are thoroughly inspected.''



 More than 9,300 commercial trucks, carrying everything from 


 pinatas to electronics, pass through Nuevo Laredo into Laredo 


 each day, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection 


 officials. As cargo shifts from Los Angeles to Mexico, it is 


 expected to triple the amount of traffic moving from Mexico 


 through the Texas highway system.



 At the same time, drug cartels are using the trucks to 


 piggy-back more than $10 million a day in drugs through the 


 Laredo corridor into the United States, according to senior 


 DEA officials interviewed by the Daily Bulletin.



 The numbers aren't surprising, said TJ Bonner, president of 


 the National Border Patrol Council. In July, Bonner testified 


 before Congress that less than 5 percent of the 6 million 


 cargo containers entering the U.S. each year are physically 


 inspected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents.



 ''From the standpoint of homeland security, this plan 


 (Gateway to the Pacific) is a nightmare,'' Bonner said. ''Any 


 possible benefit of expedited trade is going to be totally 


 eclipsed by the increased amount of contraband . . . slipping 


 across borders.''



 Hidden among the televisions, pinatas and clothing are 


 heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, law enforcement 


 officials say. Worse are weapons and people, and the 


 possibility of terrorist organizations using gaps in border 


 security to put their agents in the United States. ''. . . 


 All such ventures have one common factor: They have to cross 


 the border from Mexico into the U.S., and they will use one 


 of several corridors available to do so,'' the DEA report 


 points out. ''La Entrada al Pacifico is one of the 


 corridors.''

















 The Bridge




 With the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles already 


 stretched to capacity, Lazaro Cardenas' ability to handle 


 billions of dollars worth of cargo from Asia is proving a 


 godsend to global corporations and city leaders in the 


 American southwest.



 For their part, Port of Los Angeles officials say they 


 don't expect the Mexican port to siphon off anywhere near the 


 amount of cargo called for in the Gateway to the Pacific 


 Plan, though they admit business is booming.



 Theresa Adams Lopez, the L.A. port's media director, said 


 she disagrees with the assumption that half of the Asian 


 cargo headed to Los Angeles will be diverted to ports in 


 Mexico.



 ''Our cargo is expected to double and triple in the 


 upcoming years,'' she said. ''The bulk of it is still going 


 to come in through the Port of L.A. and through our partner, 


 the Port of Long Beach.



 ''A lot of the problem with new developments like the one 


 in Mexico is the infrastructure rail and roads to get things 


 out. Coming here is literally one stop, and going there would 


 be two stops first from their original destination, and then 


 through Mexico to the United States.



 ''There is plenty of cargo to go around,'' she said. ''But 


 the contention that half of our business will go away is not 


 true.''



 Regardless, Laredo officials are pinning their hopes on 


 increased port business, and tout the World Trade Bridge and 


 its ability to handle cargo from places like Lazaro Cardenas 


 as the lifeblood of Webb County, Texas.



 Born out of NAFTA, the bridge signaled the beginning of a 


 bright future with Mexico as a significant partner in North 


 American trade.



 According to a 2004 U.S. Census Bureau report, the most 


 recent data available, the Port of Laredo handles more than 


 $130 billion worth of goods and merchandise each year. Nearly 


 86,000 transportation jobs have been created since the World 


 Trade Bridge was built. More than 90 percent of the truck 


 traffic between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo goes over it.



 Expansion of Lazaro Cardenas will allow delivery of cargo 


 to the East Coast via the World Trade Bridge four to five 


 days faster than from California, say proponents of the plan 


 especially officials in Laredo, which benefits every time 


 traffic and trade increase.



 ''NAFTA started moving Laredo away from being the frontier 


 land to the center of something very significant,'' said 


 Roger Creery, executive director of the Laredo Development 


 Foundation. ''We're not the U.S. vs. Mexico vs. Canada 


 anymore. We are the Americas.''



 Even as Congress held numerous immigration field hearings 


 during the summer to determine the extent of security 


 failures at the U.S. border, private corporations, local and 


 federal government officials and international investment 


 corporations were planning for trade expansion.



 Those plans include finishing the Trans-Texas Corridor, 


 which would open the highways to future shipping of cargo 


 from Lazaro Cardenas, whose biggest investors are Hong Kong-


 based Hutchison Port Holdings Group and Wal-Mart. Those two 


 firms already have invested more than $300 million to expand 


 the container port.



 For many business and political leaders, the economic 


 growth promised by Gateway to the Pacific and the Trans-Texas 


 Corridor outweighs any perceived danger about national 


 security or increased drug trafficking.



 That philosophy seems to be heard even in the words of 


 former Laredo Mayor Elizabeth Flores, who was criticized 


 publicly earlier this year for playing down the escalation of 


 violence in Nuevo Laredo.



 ''We've lived with the cartels all of our lives,'' Flores 


 said in an interview a few weeks before she left office. 


 ''They are a part of life on the border. Eventually, one will 


 take control, and the killings will slow down.''



 The business Lazaro Cardenas will bring to Laredo and Nuevo 


 Laredo could transform both cities, Flores added.



 ''It's about growth, not death,'' she said.



 With billions of dollars in legal trade at stake, bad 


 publicity simply isn't something business leaders or 


 politicians are willing to acknowledge, others say.



 ''See no evil, hear no evil,'' said Webb County Sheriff 


 Rick Flores, who testified before Congress numerous times 


 this year about growing violence in Laredo, the county's 


 largest city, and along the border. ''That's the way they 


 want it, and that's what they have done.''
















Violent Neighbor




 Lost in the talk about bigger business and improved trade 


 is the picture of life on the street in Nuevo Laredo.



 The drug cartels have compromised truck drivers, U.S. 


 Customs inspectors at ports of entry and business owners on 


 both sides of the river, according to residents and law 


 enforcement officials.



 And then there are the killings, which come on a stunningly 


 regular basis.



 The sound of gunfire in the distance doesn't seem to shock 


 residents in the heart of Nuevo Laredo. Many of their homes 


 are fortified with thick cement blocks, iron gates and barbed 


 wire protection from the high-powered weapons used by the 


 cartels.



 ''The government is owned by the cartels,'' said an older 


 woman returning home. ''As the trucks make their way to 


 America freely, we are forced to live like animals. While the 


 rich get richer, we are here dying, and nobody really 


 cares.''



 Residents in Nuevo Laredo say that the violence has only 


 become worse over the past year. Expansion of trade routes 


 will only heighten the tension and violence among Mexico's 


 cartels, they contend.



 ''They want to control the routes into the United States,'' 


 said Nacho, a Nuevo Laredo resident whose real name was 


 withheld to protect his identity. ''In a way, they already 


 do. And U.S. officials should be worried, because the cartels 


 will do anything for money. They will kill anyone, help 


 anyone, do anything to get what they need to move contraband 


 across the border for the right price.''



 The DEA report echoes what Nacho and other residents 


 believe. The possibility of a ''direct, nearly inspection-


 free route to the central U.S. and expanded market for 


 drugs'' has or will result in the following, according to the 


 report:



 Networks created by Mexican and Asian organized crime 


 organizations to smuggle illegal aliens, counterfeit products 


 and pirated intellectual property into Mexico.



 Cargo containers being used to smuggle drugs into the U.S.





 Distribution networks being created by Asian gangs in 


 communities.



 Creation of legitimate businesses in the U.S. to cover up 


 smuggling, contraband and money laundering.



 Expedited truck inspections ''to keep substantial backup of 


 trucks from regularly occurring.''



 The cartels' reach extends well beyond the streets and 


 people of Nuevo Laredo and the border, however.



 On Dec. 12, newly elected President Felipe Calderon sent 


 more than 6,500 troops to Michoacan, where the Port of Lazaro 


 Cardenas is located, in an effort to get a handle on the 


 growing violence.



 Calderon also transferred 10,000 troops from the army and 


 navy to the federal police force on Dec. 13, the largest move 


 against narcotics traffickers since his predecessor, former 


 President Vicente Fox, sent nearly 1,000 troops to Nuevo 


 Laredo to squelch a drug war that has killed more than 3,000 


 people across the country during the past two years.



 Calderon may have learned how deadly dealing with the 


 cartels can be. First Lady Margarita Zavala, Calderon's wife, 


 lost her cousin, Luis Felipe Zavala, on Dec. 12 when gunmen 


 open fired on his SUV in Mexico City.



 According to DEA intelligence officials, Zavala's 


 assassination was retaliation for Calderon's promise to take 


 down Mexico's drug kingpins. ''It was an assassination of 


 opportunity,'' said one DEA intelligence official who 


 requested anonymity. ''... It was directly related to 


 Calderon's move into Michoacan.''



 However, Mexico's attorney general, Eduardo Medina Mora, 


 told reporters the incident was a coincidence.



 ''There is at this time no indication ... that would 


 suggest or make us guess that this unfortunate event was 


 related to the Mexican government's efforts against organized 


 crime,'' he told reporters at a press conference a day after 


 the killing.



 Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Department of 


 Homeland Security has tried to beef up security along the 


 border. Officials say new technologies radiation portal 


 monitors, hand-held radiation detectors and X-ray machines 


 assist front-line agents in detecting dangerous materials 


 that may be in trucks at ports of entry.



 U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Pat Jones said 


 striking a balance between increased traffic and inspections 


 is challenging. New programs implemented by the Department of 


 Homeland Security have assisted in better checks at ports of 


 entries along the southwest border, he said.



 ''It may be possible to improve the flow of legitimate 


 trade and improve security,'' Jones said. ''Prior to 9/11, 


 the thought was that if you improve security, you're going to 


 slow down cargo trade. We've learned that if you actually 


 could identify and separate the risk-free cargo, the flow of 


 cargo could be expedited.''



 But once the illegal cargo finds its way into the U.S., 


 there's little law enforcement can do.



 Laredo police can barely keep up with the violence spilling 


 into their community from their sister city across the 


 border. Sheriff Flores said growing violence and corruption 


 in Mexico is spilling into the U.S. and becoming increasingly 


 difficult to manage.



 ''The cartels have more power, money and weaponry than we 


 do,'' he said. ''The cartels know how to get their narcotics 


 across the (World Trade) bridge. They're not afraid to lose 


 some of their loads; they expect it. The risk is worth it 


 because the possibility of getting caught is minimal, at 


 best.''
