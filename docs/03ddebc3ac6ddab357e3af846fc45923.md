`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 14 December 2009`

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, before I address the issue 
which has brought me to the floor tonight, I want to recognize the 
ultimate sacrifice made by a young man from my district in the service 
of the United States Marine Corps.

I am sad to report that my office received news last week that Marine 
Corporal Xhacob LaTorre, from Waterbury, Connecticut died due to wounds 
received in combat in the Helmand province of Afghanistan. Corporal 
LaTorre's fatal injuries were the result of a roadside bomb.

I speak for myself and for my constituents in expressing my 
appreciation for this young man's service in the defense of his 
country. Corporal LaTorre, who would have turned 22 last weekend, is 
one of America's heroes. I send my prayers and my condolences to his 
family; to his wife, Frances; to his son; and to his brother, Corporal 
Daniel LaTorre, on this tragic loss. We will never forget the sacrifice 
he has made for us.
