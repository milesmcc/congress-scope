`Mr. SHAYS â€” 12 February 2008`

---


Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, a mere 20 years old, Private First Class 
Johnathon Millican of Trafford, Alabama, displayed wisdom beyond his 
years when he once said, ''You don't have to love the war, but you have 
to love the warrior.''

It is an honor for me to speak today about Private Millican, a true 
American hero who epitomizes bravery and loyalty to his country and 
fellow comrades.

Soon after graduating high school in 2005, Johnathon Millican 
enlisted into the Army and was assigned to the 377th Parachute Field 
Artillery Regiment from Fort Richardson, Alaska. In Karbala, Iraq, on 
January 20, 2007, Private Millican was off duty in a communications 
room talking with his wife, Shannon, when an attack started. The 
attackers fired several rounds and a grenade into the room, and 
tragically, he and four fellow officers lost their lives. Private 
Millican had been in Iraq for just 3 months.

Family and friends will forever remember Johnathon Millican's 
dedication to the cause of freedom and his commitment to bringing that 
cherished freedom to the people around the world where he served. It is 
with gratitude for his bravery and sacrifice and for the sacrifice of 
those who loved him that I ask all Members to join me in naming the 
Lula, Georgia, postal facility located on McLeod Street in his honor.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
