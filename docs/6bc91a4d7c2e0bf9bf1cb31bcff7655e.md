`Mr. WALZ of Minnesota â€” 23 May 2007`

Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
2199. I want to thank my colleague from Maine for sponsoring this piece 
of legislation; also thank my colleague from Maine (Mr. Michaud), who's 
been a leader on this issue and veterans issues in general; grateful 
that he introduced this piece of legislation, and grateful that he 
allowed a piece of legislation that I had introduced establishing the 
five TBI centers around the country.

I'd also like to thank the ranking member, the gentleman from 
Indiana, for his thoughtful guidance on the colocation of those 
facilities. I think it's absolutely the right thing to do. I think it 
concentrates our resources and our expertise. So I thank him for that 
addition to it.

The colocation at the polytrauma centers is the right thing to do. 
The research that's being done there is world class. And I think an 
example of how we can enhance that comes from, and you just heard one 
of my colleagues speaking about this injury.

I visit the VA centers every Veterans Day for the last quite some 
time. And several years ago there was a young man from Michigan there, 
and he had suffered a traumatic brain injury. He had survived a 
shrapnel wound, but his brain had literally been turned inside of his 
head. And because of the great care he was receiving there, he was 
stabilized, and he was starting to rehabilitate. This bill will allow 
us to enhance his recovery, starting to reintegrate him back to the 
life that he knows and that he should be able to live.

On this floor we're going to continue to debate the wars. We're going 
to continue to see the debates divide us on the war in Iraq. This 
Congress, and I thank the ranking member, and the chairman for allowing 
the care of our veterans to bring us back together. Regardless of how 
we feel on this war, this Congress and this committee is proving that 
the 110th Congress can and will advance crucial legislation like H.R. 
2199. So I thank you both. I thank my colleagues.
