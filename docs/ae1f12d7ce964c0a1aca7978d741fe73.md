Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day--a day in which a 
domestic social agenda has hijacked the Defense Authorization bill. The 
men and women in our armed services should be the first and foremost 
priority of this bill. Instead, this domestic social agenda is being 
strapped on the backs of our troops. We should not do it.

Creating new ''hate crimes'' is controversial. A stand-alone bill has 
passed the House, but apparently its advocates do not believe they can 
get it through the Senate. So they have attached it to the Defense 
Authorization Bill.

However one feels about hate crimes, it is wrong to include that 
provision in this bill. The hate crimes provisions have nothing to do 
with the Defense Authorization Bill, and it should not be here.

There are a number of good things in this bill--provisions I support 
and issues I have worked on. But I cannot condone forcing a domestic 
political issue into a national security bill.

And I worry that doing this makes it less likely than ever that 
national security will stay above domestic politics.

We are faced with a serious situation in Afghanistan which requires 
our best efforts and our concentrated focus. Mr. Speaker, our troops 
and our nation expect better of us than this.
