Mr. OBEY. Drone on, drone on, O ship of State. That's what I'm 
tempted to recite when I hear these repetitious dronings on bill after 
bill after bill.

Let me simply say, I think it is legitimate for individual Members of 
this body to offer amendments in order to illustrate their concern 
about a larger question. I've done that many times myself in this 
institution.

But I think that after 3 weeks of hearing the same point made again 
and again, we understand that these gentlemen believe that we are 
putting too much money into education and health care and science and 
other areas that we regard as crucial investments, and that's a 
perfectly legitimate position to have. But please spare me the 
sanctimony, spare me the nonsense that somehow these amendments will 
contribute in any meaningful way to significant deficit reduction.

Let me simply point out, if people were interested in significant 
deficit reduction, they would not be supporting an Iraqi war which has 
already spent over $400 billion and which we'll spend another 140 
billion bucks by the time we pass the President's supplemental. They 
would not be insisting that we provide $57 billion in tax cuts to 
people making a million bucks a year. No, they don't argue about those 
two things.

What do they do? They come to the floor and squawk about an $8 
million program to help the poorest rural communities in this country 
get basic services like sewer and water. I represent many towns in my 
District with populations of less than a thousand people. At least half 
the households in many of those towns are headed either by senior 
citizens or a woman with a low income, and that means that when they 
get hit with the DNR order to clean up their water or clean up their 
sewer, they do not have the tax base to proceed, and they don't have 
technical expertise even to know how to begin going about it.

We've got a $385 billion backlog in this country of sewer and water 
needs, and yet we're hearing these complaints about this tiny little 
program and what terrible abuse it is for the taxpayer.

Imagine a congressional committee trying to do something to help poor 
communities deal with their sewer and water problems. Isn't that awful? 
Isn't that wasteful? Good God, Almighty, we ought to be putting that $8 
million into the pockets of millionaires in additional tax cuts, right? 
At least that's what their record shows they believe. Nonsense.

I'm getting up once on this amendment, but I don't intend to 
continually get up in what is a filibuster by amendment. So I wanted to 
get that off my chest once, and then I'm just going to sit back and let 
people drone on, drone on, O ship of State, and occasionally I might 
even listen.

Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
