Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I have so many concerns about this 
supplemental, I don't know where to start. But I'm going to start at 
one point. And I believe the most important point is, this supplemental 
keeps us involved in Iraq, and it sets up an unending occupation of 
Afghanistan.

The cost of the supplemental is just too great without a defined 
stated mission, without redeployment plans. We're going to look at an 
endless military presence in Afghanistan. That will just serve to fuel 
anti-Americanism throughout the region, and it will continue to promote 
the instability.

Sadly, the rule does not provide Members a chance to remedy the 
situation. Proposals providing accountability and transparency from my 
colleague Barbara Lee, from Jim McGovern, from John Tierney actually 
haven't had a chance for an up or down vote. It could have made a 
difference when we voted on the floor today.

The American people deserve much better than that. I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this funding and promote a foreign policy based on 
SMART security, humanitarian assistance, development and diplomacy.
