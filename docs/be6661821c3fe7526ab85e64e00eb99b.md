# UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST
## `be6661821c3fe7526ab85e64e00eb99b`
`Mr. REID â€” 6 February 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, this is 
basically the same thing that has been asked before. The issue before 
the American people is whether the President of the United States, on 
his own, should be able to send 48,000 American soldiers to Iraq, 
costing approximately $30 billion extra.

The Republicans can run, as I said yesterday, but they cannot hide. 
That is the issue before the American people. We all support the 
troops, and we have fought very hard, in spite of our misgivings about 
this war, to make sure they have everything they have needed.

It is interesting that there is a lot of talk about the Gregg 
amendment. But if you look at the Gregg amendment and at page 2--the 
last paragraph on page 2 of his amendment--and you look in the Warner 
amendment on page 3, paragraph 4, it is identical language. Warner has 
encapsulated within his amendment what Gregg wanted, which is the so-
called ''resolve clause.''

This is all a game to divert attention from the fact that we have 
before us now an issue that the American people want us to address: 
whether there should be a surge, an escalation, an augmentation of the 
already disastrous war taking place in Iraq, causing 3,100 American 
deaths, approximately; 24,000 wounded American soldiers, a third of 
whom are hurt very badly; 2,000 are missing multiple limbs--brain 
injuries, blindness, paralysis. That is what 8,000 American soldiers 
now are going through--men and women.

So I ask my friend to amend his request in the following manner:

I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be 
discharged from further consideration of S. Con. Res. 7, by Senator 
Warner, and S. Res. 70, by Senator McCain, and the Senate proceed to 
their consideration en bloc; that there be 6 hours for debate equally 
divided between the two leaders or their designees on both resolutions, 
to be debated concurrently; that no amendments or motions be in order 
to either resolution; that at the conclusion or yielding back of the 
time, the Senate vote on Senator McCain's resolution, followed by a 
vote on Senator Warner's resolution; that if either resolution fails to 
garner 60 votes, the vote be vitiated and the resolution be returned to 
its prior status; that immediately following the votes on the 
resolutions I have just mentioned, the Senate turn to the consideration 
of H.J. Res. 20, the infamous continuing resolution, funding the 
Government after February 15 for the rest of the fiscal year; that 
there be 4 hours for debate on the joint resolution; that no amendments 
or motions be in order in relation to it; that at the conclusion or 
yielding back of the time, the Senate vote on final passage of the 
joint resolution; that if the joint resolution fails to get 60 votes, 
the vote be vitiated and the joint resolution be returned to the 
calendar.


I announce that if we are able to do that--dispose of these three 
items I have mentioned--this week, or whenever we finish them, then we 
would begin the Presidents Day recess at the conclusion of this week. 
One of the things we found is that because of the accelerated work 
schedule, people are having a lot of work to do at home. So that is why 
we would do this.

Madam President, there would be no amendments to the CR from either 
side. I mention that because, in getting to the point where we are, 
there has been total consultation by the majority and minority, each 
subcommittee, and the majority and ranking members. The chair and 
ranking members work very closely. One of the people heavily involved 
in this, for example, is Senator Domenici, my long-term partner on the 
Energy and Water Subcommittee on Appropriations. He fought for more, 
and he got more. That happened with many Republicans who spoke out, and 
most of them did.

I further say that if there were ever a bipartisan measure, it is the 
continuing resolution. But we have to finish before February 15.

So I ask my friend, the Republican leader, to accept my alteration to 
his unanimous consent request.
