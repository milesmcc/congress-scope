`Ms. PELOSI â€” 15 May 2008`

---


Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I want to commend 
you, Chairman Obey, and Mr. Murtha, for your tireless work on behalf of 
our men and women in uniform, and for bringing this critical 
legislation to the floor today. I am particularly interested in part 
two and three of the resolution.

We're all grateful for the fact that this will be the last time we 
will vote on an Iraq supplemental in the House of Representatives. 
Again, I thank the chairman and the chairman for their important work 
in this regard.

When the House completes its work today, we will have achieved three 
goals. First, we will have set a new direction in Iraq that will end 
this sad chapter in American history and bring our brave men and women 
home. That is necessary because President Bush, in his request to the 
Congress, insists on his failed course of action in Iraq, failed from 
day one; day one, when they went in and thought the war would end in 
one day.

They're asking us to trust the same impaired judgment that took us 
into this war on a false premise, without the proper training and 
equipment for our troops, without a strategy for success or an exit 
strategy from Iraq.

Isn't it sad that here we are, over 5 years later, over 4,000 of our 
precious treasure have died, tens of thousands of our men and women in 
uniform have been wounded, many of them permanently. Our reputation in 
the world has been greatly diminished, harming our ability to stop the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and eradicate disease and 
alleviate poverty, and all of the other leadership roles we have played 
in the past. It has come at a tremendous cost in dollars to American 
taxpayers, trillions of dollars, which have taken us deeply into debt, 
which has taken us into recession. More on that later. But think of the 
opportunity cost of that money, what we could have done to invest in 
education and health care. We will pay any price any time to protect 
the American people, but not to follow the whim of the impaired 
judgment of this Bush administration.

Only when we finally end this war can we rebuild our military. And 
that is another cost of this war, diminishing the capacity of our 
military to meet challenges and threats to our security wherever they 
may occur. When we do that, we will be able to refocus our attention on 
the real war on terror.

So this action that we are proposing today, a new direction in Iraq 
that will end the war, will rebuild our military, refocus on the real 
war on terror, and restore our reputation in the world. That is why 
this legislation directs that a redeployment begin within 30 days of 
this bill's enactment, and with the goal of being completed by December 
2009, be completed by then. The new President will have the flexibility 
to bring our troops home safely, honorably, responsibly, and soon.

Essential to restoring our reputation in the world is to regain our 
moral authority, which has been lost in this war. That is why under the 
conditions of this legislation torture is banned. Thank you, Mr. 
Murtha, for your leadership on this subject. This condition has passed 
this House overwhelmingly in the defense appropriation bill.

It will also ban permanent bases in Iraq. This condition has passed 
this House overwhelmingly on any number of occasions, over 300 votes. 
Insist that the Iraqis pay their fair share for reconstruction. This is 
a relatively new condition, but a necessary one predicated on the fact 
that the Iraqis are amassing a budget surplus while we're going deeply 
in debt to pay for their reconstruction. We're saying if we put up a 
dollar, you put up a dollar, dollar for dollar to participate in their 
reconstruction. They have to be at least as interested in rebuilding 
Iraq as we are, especially when we are doing it to the neglect of our 
own reconstruction needs in the United States.

This legislation will also ensure that our military pays only its 
fair share for fuel. Do you know that in Iraq, we pay almost 2/1/2/ 
times as much for gasoline, our military does, than the Iraqi people 
do? The Iraqi Government subsidizes the Iraqi people and makes our 
military pay more than double. And that's a new condition.

The conditions here calling for the cleaning up of waste, fraud and 
abuse in Iraq and reviewing of contracting passed by suspension. Over 
two-thirds of the House voted for this legislation that is contained in 
this condition. And require that any agreements with Iraq that commit 
U.S. forces for the protection of the Iraqi Government from an external 
force or from a civil war internally must be approved by the Congress 
of the United States.

Under the guise of a Status of Forces Agreement, the administration 
is committing the United States to a treaty without congressional 
approval. I remind the President of article I. Read the Constitution, 
Mr. President.

I believe that these provisions should receive bipartisan support. 
They have every time they have come to the floor. The only two new ones 
are about the cost of fuel and the dollar for dollar.

What we will also accomplish in this bill is to honor our 
responsibility to our men and women in uniform. I have been to the 
theater, to the war area, five or six times in the course of this 
military action, sometimes with Mr. Murtha, with Mr. Skelton, with Mr. 
Lantos, with our committee Chairs of jurisdiction.



And when we meet the young people there, they always say the same 
thing: ''What is going to happen to me when I go home?'' ''What is 
going to happen to me when I go home?''

Some of the soldiers were telling me about their lives at home, and 
one of them was very quiet, and I said to him, ''What did you do before 
you came to Iraq?''

He said, ''I was in high school, ma'am.'' He was in high school. He 
was a teenager with a gun over his shoulder. If that's necessary for 
our country's security, it has to happen. But this young man, a 
teenager, fighting that fight without any thought about what was going 
to happen to him when he came home.

Well, what we would like to say in the final amendment here is that 
when you come home, young man, we will thank you for your service to 
our country by sending you to college. That's what the student veterans 
have asked us for. That is what we have done for veterans in the past. 
That is what we owe these young people now. And in doing so, we will be 
doing a great thing not only for them but for our country because their 
education will be part of the economic recovery of our country. In the 
security of our country, they have led the way. In the economic 
recovery of our country, they will be in the lead.

Third in this bill, we will begin to address America's domestic 
priorities. We will address the deep economic pain facing many 
families. As I mentioned, this war, President Bush's war, which is 
enabled by the complicity of the Republicans in Congress, has taken us 
deeply into debt, which has taken us deeply into recession, and now has 
taken our economy to a place where we have record numbers of people 
unemployed. Today 7.6 million people are unemployed. Of these, 1.4 
million Americans, jobless Americans, have been looking for work for 
over 6 months. And our economy has lost 260,000 jobs this year so far 
alone. These people need our help as they continue to seek work in this 
difficult economy.

Thank you, Mr. Obey, for including the unemployment insurance for 
America's workers in this legislation.

The contrast, I believe, Mr. Speaker, is clear. President Bush and 
the Republicans in Congress insist on a war without end in Iraq. 
Democrats, Independents, and Republicans across the country, but, 
sadly, too few Republicans in this House, are insisting on a New 
Direction. A New Direction that strengthens America's military by 
ending the war in Iraq. A New Direction that strengthens America's 
economy by investing in our veterans and our workers here at home.

We have said over and over again that one way to support our troops 
is to build a future worthy of their sacrifice. We can begin building 
that future worthy of their sacrifice by saying ''thank you'' to them 
and, when they come home, to send them to college.

I urge my colleagues to support the second and the third amendments 
that are being presented today. And in closing, I want to, as always, 
salute our men and women in uniform for their service, their sacrifice, 
their courage,


their patriotism, and with our commitment, again, to build a future 
worthy of their sacrifice.
