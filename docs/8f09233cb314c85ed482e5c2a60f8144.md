Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, throughout our history, 
Americans have risen up to help our troops win wars--from merchants and 
storekeepers in the Revolutionary War to Rosie the Riveter in World War 
II. Today, that tradition continues, as average citizens directly 
support our troops in Iraq and in Afghanistan.

A non-profit charity called Troops Need You delivers resources our 
troops need--from medical supplies and equipment to school supplies and 
water purification systems, Troops Need You was founded by a military 
man himself, Major Eric Egland, an intelligence officer and former 
counter-terrorism operative who has served around the world, including 
in Afghanistan and Iraq. He knows what it takes to win.

Troops Need You has already mobilized over one thousand Americans, 
and is based on innovations so effective that they earned not only a 
partnership with General David Petraeus but even praise from the 
President of the United States himself.

We are at a critical point in Iraq, defeating the terrorists to deny 
them a safe haven to attack American families and our allies. Success 
requires more Americans to rise up and help our troops succeed. A great 
way to do that is through Troops Need You.
