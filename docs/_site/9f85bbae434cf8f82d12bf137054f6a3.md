Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. It 
contains language that I introduced to help us avoid a case of 
unintended consequences.

This spring, a provision was slipped into the Iraq War Supplemental 
appropriation that requires Medicaid prescriptions to be written on 
tamper-resistant pads for Medicaid reimbursements starting October 1. 
The tamper-proof pad mandate was designed to fight fraud, and that's a 
good thing, but this October 1 deadline isn't enough time for States to 
inform providers and patients about the new requirements. This could 
mean patients are turned away from pharmacies as of this next week and 
their prescriptions not be filled. And that paper isn't widely 
available. Pharmacies that fill prescriptions not written on that 
special paper may be forced out of business if they're not getting 
reimbursed by Medicaid. All we need is a 6-month delay. The clock is 
ticking on this, and I'm asking for your help.
