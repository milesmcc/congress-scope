# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Mr. WU. Fanaticism, George Santyana famously said, is ''redoubling 
your effort when you have forgotten your aim.''

Let us measure our efforts against our aims in Iraq. After great 
effort, Saddam is dead. After long effort, we have established there 
are no WMD. We have eliminated Iraq as a threat to its neighbors. We 
have achieved the President's Iraq war aims.

Why are we sending 21,000 more troops there, rather than redeploying 
all our troops out of Iraq? Because we have forgotten our aims. Now we 
referee a civil war between the peoples of Iraq. The President admitted 
as much in his State of the Union, saying ''This is not the war we 
entered but the war that we are in.''

The use of force resolution we passed in 2002 nowhere authorizes our 
participation in an Iraqi civil war. It has, therefore, expired. The 
President must come back to Congress for reauthorization if he wishes 
to war further in Iraq or to extend the war to Iran.

The fact that we are in a civil war is backed up by our own national 
intelligence estimate, as well as my conversations with soldiers who 
served, serve or who will serve in Iraq.

I share with you a typical comment: ''I joined the Army, and I will 
go as many times as they send me. But I will tell you what. These folks 
have been killing each other for 1,000 years. They are killing each 
other today and may kill each other for another thousand years. I just 
don't see what good we are doing there.''

This loyal soldier deserves our support and our protection.

John Murtha's efforts to craft an emergency supplemental 
appropriations bill to protect our troops is commendable. No soldier 
should be repeatedly deployed to Iraq without being rested, retrained 
and ready. To do so otherwise is an abuse of our citizen soldiers. It 
is a criminal dereliction of duty. It is an abuse of power.

The Constitution gives Congress the express power to regulate the 
military. We must exercise this responsibility and stop the abuse of 
our troops by building thoughtful guidelines into our defense 
appropriations bills.

Some want us to believe that we must either stand aside and let the 
President have his way or use the blunt axe of cutting off all funding 
for the Iraq war. Not true. Not only does the Constitution give to 
Congress, not the President, the power and responsibility to regulate 
the military, there is ample precedent to support Congress's authority 
in wartime.

In the 19th century, Congress went so far as to require President 
Andrew Johnson to obtain the signature of General Ulysses S. Grant to 
any of the President's military orders before it could become valid. 
The President obeyed.

President Truman was forced in the Youngstown Steel case to recognize 
that his powers as Commander in Chief were severely limited when they 
undermined congressional decisions. Even though a steel strike 
seriously affected our ability to fight the Korean war, the Commander 
in Chief could not act independently of Nation's laws.

President Bush needs to learn that we are a Nation of laws and that 
no one in America is above the law. He needs to listen to the American 
people. He should heed our professional military, rather than shop for 
a convenient opinion.

The American people understand the challenges in Iraq are political 
and that no amount of military force can retrieve the situation. Only 
the Iraqis can solve the problems of Iraq. Our staying merely delays 
their day of full responsibility, and that is why this Iraqi government 
asked us not to escalate until, like our own generals, they were 
browbeaten into submission by President Bush.

We must end this war with a minimum of domestic recrimination, a 
maximum of motive and opportunity for the many peoples of Iraq to solve 
their own problems without genocide, one last chance to win the war in 
Afghanistan, the last known mailing address of Osama bin Laden, and we 
must begin the long task of rebuilding America's foreign policy on its 
traditional bipartisan basis.

We must forsake fanaticism and never forget our national aims.

My colleagues, this President has never had the authorization from 
Congress to enter a civil war in Iraq. Our mission is done. Bring the 
troops home.
