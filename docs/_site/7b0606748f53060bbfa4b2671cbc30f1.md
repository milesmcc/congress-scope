Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Green 
amendment that would extend FEMA housing assistance to Hurricane 
Katrina victims through December 31, 2007.

A year and a half after the terrible disaster, Gulf Coast residents 
still face unfulfilled promises, bureaucratic red tape, public neglect, 
environmental squalor and private exploitation.

This is outrageous and should be condemned. Yet again, the 
administration's failure to provide for the residents of the region has 
left it to Congress to make things right. That we are still making the 
same arguments over and over again to ensure that Gulf Coast residents 
get what's only fair is unacceptable.



The unnecessary Iraq war has diverted precious resources away from 
domestic emergencies. Our brothers and sisters here at home are waiting 
to re-build their lives and homes.

That is why the Green Amendment is so important.

Specifically, the Green Amendment would extend the safety-net of FEMA 
housing assistance until December 31, 2007 and thereafter transfer 
eligible households to HUD's tenant-based rental assistance program. 
Through this amendment, Section 8 vouchers would also be available to 
households in trailers and mobile homes.

If we do not adopt this amendment, over 120,000 families housed in 
FEMA-funded trailers, mobile homes and who barely cope in other rental 
assistance situations could be thrown into further chaos and 
homelessness when current assistance ends in August. This would further 
compound the dire affordable housing situation relating to low-income, 
elderly, and disabled evacuees across the country.

The region is still not back to normal. Consider the fact that there 
are 51 percent fewer hospital beds in New Orleans than were available 
pre-Hurricane Katrina according to data released by the NAACP.

Public infrastructure and public institutions are operating below 
capacity. In New Orleans, only about one-third of the public schools 
have re-opened. These statistics are staggering.

It is not only a responsibility but a moral duty to do all in our 
power to restore the dignity and quality of life to all citizens of the 
Gulf Coast region regardless of their socio-economic, cultural and 
political status. They are counting on us. I urge my colleagues to 
support the Green Amendment.
