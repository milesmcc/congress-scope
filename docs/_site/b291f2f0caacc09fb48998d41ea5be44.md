Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special 
person, U.S. Army SPC Justin Pellerin of Concord, NH, for his service 
and supreme sacrifice for our Nation.

Tragically, on August 20, 2009, this courageous young soldier, only 
21 years of age, gave his last full measure of devotion when an 
explosive device detonated near his vehicle in Wardak Province, 
Afghanistan. At the time of the incident, Specialist Pellerin was 
serving as an infantryman assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry 
Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division based at Fort 
Drum, NY.

Justin joined the U.S. Army in June 2007 after graduating from 
Concord High School and deployed in January in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom. This decorated patriot is the recipient of the 
National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War 
on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, NATO Service Medal, 
and most recently, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star.

Heroes from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with 
honor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Afghanistan. Undoubtedly, 
Justin has advanced that fine tradition. Daniel Webster said: ''God 
grants liberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to guard 
and defend it.'' Justin chose to serve our Nation, guard our precious 
liberties, and answer the call of freedom. Our debt of gratitude will 
never be fully repaid to Justin or his loved ones.

The sudden death of a young person is especially difficult for family 
and friends. In November 1864, President Abraham Lincoln was informed 
by the War Department of a mother who had lost five sons in the Civil 
War. He wrote the mother: ''I feel how weak and fruitless must be any 
word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a 
loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the 
consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died 
to save.''

My heartfelt sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Justin's 
wife Chelsey; his parents Dale and Melissa, and family and friends. The 
death of Justin, on a battlefield far from New Hampshire, is a true 
loss for our State and Nation, and a grievous pain for those who knew 
him best and loved him most. Although he will be sorely missed by all, 
it is my hope that his family and friends may find some comfort in 
knowing that Justin's devotion, sense of duty, and selfless dedication 
have made the safety and liberty of each and every American more 
secure. May God bless SPC Justin Pellerin.
