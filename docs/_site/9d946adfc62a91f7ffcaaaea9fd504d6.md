Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of two 
members of the Armed Forces from my home state of Arizona. Every month 
Scottsdale Healthcare honors service members that perform diligent 
service to this country. This month, they have recognized two siblings: 
Sergeant Chauncey K. Lovell and Airman 1st Class Althea Lovell.

I commend Scottsdale Healthcare for paying tribute to such 
outstanding service members for their bravery and service to our 
country.

Sergeant Chauncey Lovell has been in the Marine Corps for six and a 
half years, which he has included three deployments to Iraq in 2004, 
2006, and 2008. He is currently deployed and will be transferred in 
November to his home station, Marine Corps Base Kaneohe, on the island 
of Oahu, Hawaii. His record includes the National Defense Service 
Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, a 
Meritorious Mast and a Certificate of Commendation among others.

Airman First Class Althea Lovell is also on active duty as a Dental 
Hygienist at the Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany. Having joined the 
Air Force three years ago, this is her first deployment. She is 
accompanied by her husband, Gil, who is a Tech Sergeant working in the 
operating room on the same base, and their six-month-old daughter, 
Chloe. Airman First Class Lovell and her family expect to be reassigned 
to Hickham Air Force Base in Hawaii.

Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing the inspiring combined 
efforts of this brother and sister who are serving our country and 
protecting the lives of their fellow servicemen in combat.
