Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for 
yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the rule and also the underlying bill, 
the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. We can't afford to spend 
$10 billion a month on this failed war and continue to see the loss of 
lives, 3,600 now. From my district alone, 14 individuals have not come 
home to see their families. 27,000 have come home injured from the war.

I want to tell you that in March I had the opportunity to visit some 
of our troops in Iraq, many from California representing southern 
California's San Gabriel Valley. Many of them told me they did not have 
appropriate equipment, that they were there for an insurmountable time, 
many on their second, third and fourth tour. One family member from the 
City of Azusa told me that he had not even seen his child. It had been 
already 14 months.

I would ask Members of Congress to remember who our constituents are. 
I have the adjoining district next to Congressman Dreier. In my 
district alone, 4-1 in a survey said, Republican and Democrat, we want 
the Congress to get us out of the war.

I ask for support of our bill and the rule.
