Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I rise today in support of H. Res. 944, honoring the service and 
accomplishments of Lieutenant General Russel L. Honore, United States 
Army, for his 37 years of service on behalf of the United States.

And let me first take a moment to thank Representative David Scott of 
Georgia for helping us to recognize General Honore and getting this 
resolution to the floor here today. And I want to certainly allow him 
the spotlight in terms of talking about this extraordinary gentleman.

Very briefly, he is a native of Lakeland, Louisiana, graduated from 
Southern University and A&M College in 1971. Upon graduation, he was 
commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army.

During his career, General Honore has served a number of infantry 
command positions in the Army, including tours in Germany and as 
commanding officer of the Second Infantry Division in Korea. He had 
also seen action in Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm and 
served as Vice Director for Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
here in Washington, DC.

Through his efforts and command, he was responsible for the training 
and deployment of a half million National Guard and Reserve members. In 
addition, he led the Joint Task Force Katrina following the hurricane's 
destruction of the gulf coast in 2005, where he commanded all active 
duty troops from all branches dedicated to storm recovery operations.

This Nation owes a debt of gratitude to General Honore for his 
commitment to the defense of our great Nation.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
