Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, while I was back in the 
Fourth Congressional District of Minnesota, I met with Wes Davey, a 
constituent and master sergeant in the Army Retired Reserves. He fought 
in Operation Iraqi Freedom and is concerned about the funding of the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As Congress begins to debate providing 
supplemental appropriations for these wars, I would like to enter Wes's 
thoughtful words into the Congressional Record.


























 St. Paul, MN,

 Hon. Betty McCollum,


 Western Avenue North,


 St. Paul, MN.



 Dear Representative McCollum:
The President has requested 


 additional funding to continue the war in Iraq. Before the 


 members of Congress approve this budget, they should consider 


 doing three things.



 First, increase taxes in order to at least partially pay 


 for the current and future war funding requests. If these 


 wars are in our national interest as President Bush and 


 others have often told us, we should be willing to pay for 


 them; if these wars are not in our national interest, we 


 should get out of both countries.



 It is wrong for our generation to pass off the entire Iraq 


 and Afghanistan war debt to the future generations of 


 taxpayers, and it is also wrong for President Bush and 


 Congress to abrogate their fiscal responsibilities and expect 


 future presidents and future members of Congress to sort out 


 the funding mess from these wars.



 Second, the United States Treasury should sell war bonds 


 (as we did during WW2) to finance the portion of the war 


 costs not funded by increased taxes. We need to stop 


 borrowing money from foreign countries to finance our wars. 


 Countries such as Saudi Arabia and China are not loaning us 


 money because they have America's best interest at heart, and 


 their economic influence in our country is already too great.



 Third, Congress should set up a government internet website 


 which explains in detail to the American public how the wars 


 in Iraq and Afghanistan have been and will be financed. More 


 specifically, where the money has come from, be it China, 


 Saudi Arabia, or other countries, how much each foreign 


 country has loaned us, at what interest rates, and exactly 


 when and how those loans will be repaid.



 Thus far in these wars, President Bush has done his very 


 best to place an opaque window between war funding and the 


 American public, which goes against the belief by the 


 founders of our country that good government should transact 


 its business in the open.





 Sincerely,


 Wesley E. Davey.
