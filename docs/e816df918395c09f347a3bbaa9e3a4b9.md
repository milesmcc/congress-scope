Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, being from Tennessee, the 
Volunteer State, I volunteered to visit the men and women in uniform in 
Iraq this past weekend. I wasn't disappointed. Our troops are well 
trained, well motivated, and successful.

During my visit to Iraq, I visited Ramadi, which until just a few 
months ago was a killing field overrun by al Qaeda. For the past 4 
years, the people of Ramadi were caught in a decision-making battle of 
which group, us or the extremists, offered them the best chance for a 
normal and free existence.

The insurgent extremists chose to win the local people over with the 
use of force, force against our American troops and against any local 
who did not support their radical agenda. Our troops, on the other 
hand, have reached out with friendship and support.

The local people, seeing the difference, have chosen to have their 
lives return to normal and live in freedom. Ramadi has gone from a city 
of death and destruction to one of rebuilding and hope. I was able to 
see it firsthand.

The cost to the American family is just too great to allow any other 
outcome than success in the global war on terror. We must win this war 
to protect our American way of life, now and into the future.
