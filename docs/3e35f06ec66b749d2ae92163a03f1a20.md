## `3e35f06ec66b749d2ae92163a03f1a20`

Mr. HODES. I thank the gentleman from Ohio. In terms of the energy 
independence, the program we are going to advance as leaders in this 
Congress is designed to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of this 
country.

Mr. Speaker, last year the Federal Government only spend $2 billion, 
one week in Iraq, on all of its research into alternative and renewable 
energy forms. By setting up the kind of reserve we have now, rolling 
back the subsidies for Big Oil and putting it into a reserve for 
Federal research and research into alternative energy, just think about 
how we are going to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of this country 
for new jobs and economic prosperity on into the century.

It is now my pleasure to yield to the distinguished gentleman from 
Connecticut.
