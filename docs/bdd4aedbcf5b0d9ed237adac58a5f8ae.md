`Mr. UDALL of Colorado â€” 14 May 2010`

Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, before I ask a unanimous 
consent on an amendment, I will comment on Senator Casey's remarks that 
were just delivered so powerfully and eloquently. He is right on point 
that the efforts underway in Afghanistan are crucial to our country's 
national security.

It was important, as well, that he talked about the three main 
factors that are in play there in our ultimate success. This week, we 
had President Karzai and much of his Cabinet in Washington. I certainly 
appreciate the effort President Karzai made to show his respect for 
those who have fallen in Afghanistan in the war there. I also note 
General McChrystal was here briefing many of us. I think the Presiding 
Officer, as well, heard from him on the state of the situation in 
Afghanistan.

This isn't going to be easy. I am heartened by what I heard. I 
express my appreciation for the valor, commitment, and honor that our 
forces in Afghanistan have displayed.










Amendment No. 4016 to Amendment No. 3739
