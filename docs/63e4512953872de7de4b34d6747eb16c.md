Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the 
distinguished ranking member for the fine work he is doing on the 
Defense authorization bill. We have to get this done at a later time 
because there will not be time.

Right now I would like to address some of the comments that were made 
in the last few minutes about what some people misinterpret as not a 
successful operation in Iraq. I think it is amazing that you can be 
successful, all of our troops over there bathe in the success we have 
had in Iraq and still refer to it as an invasion instead of a 
liberation. Later on I will address those remarks.

Right now it is my understanding--I would ask if it is accurate--that 
the chairman and myself, the ranking member of the Environment and 
Public Works Committee, will be involved in about either 1 hour or 90 
minutes equally divided, I would ask the Chair. This is on the highway 
trust fund fix.
