Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, today it is my honor to welcome Major 
Jonathan Etterbeek to the House of Representatives to deliver the House 
invocation. He is a native of Holland, Michigan, and he is a chaplain 
of the U.S. Army's 32nd Medical Brigade.

The House is honored to have you with us today. We appreciate you 
being here to deliver this invocation. It is a time-honored tradition 
in this historic Chamber to request God's guidance as Congress conducts 
the business of the American people. We thank you for doing that.

Major Etterbeek is a graduate of Holland High School, Hope College, 
and Western Theological Seminary, and he is currently stationed in Fort 
Sam Houston, Texas.

While he has many accomplishments and a distinguished record in the 
military, it was especially important in 2005 where I had the 
opportunity in front of a hometown audience to present him with the 
medals that he earned for his distinguished service while he was in 
Iraq. I was honored to award him the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the 
Meritorious Service Medal, the Iraq Medal, the Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal, and the Combat Action Badge.

Major Etterbeek, thank you for being here today. Thank you for your 
service to this country.
