Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 988 is legislation introduced by Representative Ken 
Calvert to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service 
located at 5757 Tilton Avenue in Riverside, California, as the 
Lieutenant Todd Jason Bryant Post Office.

On October 31, 2003, somewhere in the Iraqi desert between Fallujah 
and Baghdad, First Lieutenant Todd Jason Bryant was killed when his 
Humvee was struck head-on by a rocket-propelled grenade. His life was 
taken instantly at age 23. He was assigned to C Company, 1-34 AR where 
he assumed duties as platoon leader, 3rd Platoon.



First Lieutenant Todd Bryant received the Bronze Star, the Purple 
Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal, the National Defense Service 
Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon for his distinguished service to his 
country.

First Lieutenant Todd Bryant is survived by his wife, Jenifer, his 
parents, Larry and Linda Bryant, his brother, Major Timothy Bryant, 
USMC, and his sister, Tiffany Bryant.

The memory of this jovial fun-loving man will live on forever through 
his family and friends. Jenifer Bryant said, ''There was a lot more to 
him than just a soldier. He was my best friend. His goal in life was to 
make people think that he was the most hilarious man alive.''

I support H.R. 988 and urge its passage.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
