Mr. SESSIONS. I agree. That is why we have passed the Military 
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, why


we have expanded it, under the leadership of the chairman. I supported 
making sure that contractors were fully covered from the original act 
based on a crime that came to my attention where a young person was 
sexually molested and the host country didn't want to prosecute it and 
they couldn't be tried and court-martialed because the person was a 
contractor, not a military person. We made that possible.

Since we are in a world in which some of these authorizations to use 
military force may be very long indeed, it is determined not by what we 
do so much as by the actions of the enemy; that is, if they continue to 
attack us, I think our authorization of military force will continue 
many years perhaps. If the conflict ends, it could be ended sooner. So 
we could be in a position, just as a matter of law, of limiting the 
amount we are exposing a contractor to of criminal prosecutions for 
something that happened many years before, when actually in the fog of 
war, sometimes it is more difficult to handle things correctly. It 
would be certainly more difficult to gather evidence, and it is more 
difficult to get witnesses here and that kind of thing.

My suggestion would be that we do as we did with the statute of 
limitations on S&L fraud but have some sort of definite end to it 
because some of these extended wartime efforts could go on for a number 
of years. I don't see as a matter of principle, not specific facts, why 
a contractor who commits fraud in the United States gets the protection 
of a 5-year statute, even if it is against the Department of Defense, 
but one in Iraq, in the chaos of war that even affects them--their 
ability to maintain discipline over their workers is sometimes more 
difficult, frankly--that they would be prosecuted with an unlimited 
statute of limitations. That is something we could discuss, and I ask 
the Senator to think about it. I don't take any fundamental objection 
to the work he is doing. It is fundamentally sound and good, and I 
support it.

I will say this, if I could: In Toussie v. United States, the Supreme 
Court held:




 The purpose of a statute of limitations--


Which I want to say is available in all cases, for all kinds of 
crimes, except very few, such as murder--




 The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit 


 exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain fixed period of 


 time following the occurrence of those acts the legislature 


 has decided to punish by criminal sanctions. Such a 


 limitation is designed to protect individuals from having to 


 defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may 


 have become obscured by the passage of time and to minimize 


 the danger of official punishment because of acts in the far-


 distant past. Such a time limit may also have the salutary 


 effect of encouraging law enforcement officials promptly to 


 investigate suspected criminal activity.


The Court has further held:




 Passage of time, whether before or after arrest, may impair 


 memories, cause evidence to be lost, deprive the defendant of 


 witnesses, and otherwise interfere with his ability to defend 


 himself. . . .Possible prejudice is inherent in any delay, 


 however short; it may also weaken the Government's case. . . 


 .Such a [statute of] limitation is designed to protect 


 individuals from having to defend themselves against charges 


 when the basic facts may have become obscured by the passage 


 of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment 


 because of acts in the far-distant past. Such a time limit 


 may also have the salutary effect of encouraging [cases to be 


 prosecuted promptly].


But I will say that is the only concern I have. I thank the Senator 
for raising this issue. It will definitely close a loophole.

I would note I had the honor last night to be on an airplane coming 
back from Alabama sitting by a young individual who served 2 years as a 
contractor in Iraq. He is going back for a third year. We talked about 
some of these things. I did not know this amendment was coming up. But 
he talked about that some of the people do not perform very well. Many 
of them are very hard working. Many of them are former military people 
who served with great distinction.

But in this time of war, some people do lose their discipline, and 
fraud is a matter of real risk. We do need to watch every penny, and we 
certainly do not need to have unscrupulous contractors billing the 
American people for work they do not perform, for making false claims 
to the Government. I think a statute of limitations probably needs to 
be extended in this case.

I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
