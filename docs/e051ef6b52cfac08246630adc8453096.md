Mr. McCAIN. I think it might be appropriate, given the Senator's 
recent probably longer stay than any Member of Congress has ever had in 
Iraq, maybe he can talk to us a bit on the record not only about where 
the troops' morale is, what they believe in, and about the issue that 
was the reason he went there, and that is this enormous challenge of 
the rule of law, and whether we are making progress in that area, and 
what he expects, particularly in the area of the prisoner situation.
