Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, after my oversight trips to Iraq in July and 
August of 2006, I concluded we needed to encourage the Iraqi 
government, and specifically Prime Minister Maliki, to take stronger 
action to improve the situation in their country, and that the best way 
to do this was to set firm timelines for Iraqi security forces to 
replace our troops who are doing police work.

I believe a workable timeline will incentivize the Iraqis to make the 
hard choices necessary to ensure stability among the three primary 
sects--Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds. We need to motivate the Iraqis to set 
firm deadlines for provincial elections, reconciliation and amnesty, 
and a final drafting of their constitution.

During 2005, Iraqis set timelines to establish and ratify a 
constitution and hold national elections. They accomplished each 
benchmark successfully. I do not believe they would have achieved this 
success if we had not pushed Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds to resolve their 
differences and compromise in order to meet the timelines we helped 
set.

The United States went into Iraq on a bipartisan basis, with two-
thirds of the House and three-quarters of the Senate voting to 
authorize the use of force. I believe we need to draw down the majority 
of our troops on a bipartisan basis, and have sought to achieve 
bipartisan solutions to improve our operations and reduce the violence.

While H.R. 4156 is by no means a perfect solution, it does propose a 
tight, but arguably reasonable, timeline for drawdown of troops in Iraq 
similar to one I proposed earlier this year. It should help bridge the 
gap between Republicans and Democrats on the most important issue of 
our time. The bill would require our commanders to begin a redeployment 
of our troops in harms way within a month, and set a target date of 
December 15, 2008, to complete the task.

For me, a better bill would have been to give Iraqis and our troops 
an additional six months to complete the drawdown, but given this bill 
sets a target date, rather than a withdrawal date, it gives needed 
flexibility to our military leadership.

I do not believe we have the force structure to maintain the number 
of troops in Iraq now, and certainly do not have the capacity to 
increase the force.

Our troops have performed extraordinarily well, but it is 
unreasonable for us to ask them to return to Iraq for a third or fourth 
tour. I also believe it was a significant mistake to extend


their tours from 12 to 15 months and would be unconscionable to 
consider extending their tours beyond 15 months. Based on our 
military's current manpower, we will need to begin to draw down our 
forces by the beginning of 2008, and it would be wise to let the Iraqis 
know now this reduction will take place.

While I support this bill, I am disappointed the majority still has 
not allowed a single amendment on any Iraq-related bill. As I have said 
before, it is pretty arrogant to think we would criticize Iraqis for 
not being able to compromise and find common ground when Republicans 
and Democrats are unable to compromise and find common ground on the 
most important issue facing our Nation.
