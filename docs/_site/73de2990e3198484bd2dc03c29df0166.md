Mr. PERLMUTTER. It's a long time, and it means that we've given young 
men and women to this fight in Iraq, we've given our treasure to Iraq, 
and we did it without the sacrifice that ordinarily comes when you 
fight a war and that is through taxes. So we ran this gigantic deficit.

Now, the Republican Congress last year didn't even pass a budget, and 
this year the Congress sent a budget to the President that balances the 
budget within 5 years, as opposed to continuing to run deficit and 
deficit and grow the debt and grow the debt. We will balance this 
budget within 5 years. Quite a feat. There's some places where we've 
got to tighten the belt, but as you said, we rolled up our sleeve, made 
some tough decisions and took on a budget that was absolutely out of 
control under the prior Congress, and we're doing something to benefit 
the American public and not saddle them with debt.
