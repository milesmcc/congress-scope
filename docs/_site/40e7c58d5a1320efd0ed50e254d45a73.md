Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to express my concern about 
amendment No. 3017, the Kyl-Lieberman amendment, which among other 
things--and most troubling--would designate the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act.

I think we all have a great deal of concern about the activities of 
Iran. We as a nation have stood strongly and will continue to speak 
strongly about those activities. We have taken no options off the 
table. I fully support all of those precepts.

At the same time, I do not believe that any serious student of 
American foreign policy could support this amendment as it now exists. 
We know there are problems in Iraq. We are trying to decipher the 
extent of those problems as they relate to Iranian weapons systems and 
the allegations of covert involvement. We also know that in Iraq other 
nations are playing covertly. The Saudis, for instance, are said to 
have the plurality of the foreign insurgents operating in Iraq and the 
majority of the suicide bombers in Iraq. We also know there is 
potential for volatility in the Kurdish area of Iraq with respect to 
the relations with Turkey.

We are addressing these problems. In fact, the ''whereas'' clauses in 
this amendment speak clearly as to how our troops on the ground are 
addressing these problems.

I fought in Vietnam. We had similar problems throughout the Vietnam 
war because of the location of Vietnam, the propinquity of China. I 
think it can fairly be said that in virtually every engagement in which 
I was involved in Vietnam, we were being shot at with weapons made 
either in China or in Eastern Europe. There is a reality to these kinds 
of wars, and we are addressing those realities. But they need to be 
addressed in a proper way.

Probably the best historical parallel comes from the situation with 
China during the Vietnam war. China was a rogue state, had nuclear 
weapons, would spout a lot of rhetoric about the United States, and had 
an American war on its border. We created the conditions in which we 
engaged China aggressively, through diplomatic and economic and other 
means. And we have arguably succeeded, along with the rest of the world 
community, in bringing China into a proper place in that world 
community.

That is not what this amendment is about. The first concern I have, 
when we are talking about making the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a 
terrorist organization, is, who actually defines a terrorist 
organization? The Congress, to my knowledge, has never defined a 
terrorist organization. The State Department defines terrorist 
organizations. At last count, from the information that I have 
received, there are 42 such organizations that have been identified by 
the State Department in accordance with the laws the Congress passed.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in 
the Record.
