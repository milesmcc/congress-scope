Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

If I could point out that the most recent reincarnation of this very 
same issue was passed earlier this year in this very House, and I would 
like to read verbatim what it said. I was proud to vote for it, and I 
will vote for it.

Sec. 1222. Continuation of prohibition on establishment of permanent 
military installations in Iraq or United States control over oil 
resources of Iraq.

Section 1519 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109-364; 120 Stat. 2444) is amended by 
inserting after ''this Act'' the following: ''or any other Act for any 
fiscal year''.

Mr. Speaker, with that I am pleased to yield with great pleasure such 
time as he may consume to a great American, the ranking member of the 
Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), 
who has also voted for this measure six times.
