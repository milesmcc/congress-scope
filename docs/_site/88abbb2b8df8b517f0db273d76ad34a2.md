Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to another great 
American hero. On July 15, 2006, Specialist Nathan Gurley of 
Fayetteville, North Carolina, though wounded, fiercely pulled 
Specialist Josh Eckley of Little York, Illinois and another crew member 
from a military vehicle that had been hit by an IED while on combat 
logistics control in Al Anbar Province in Iraq. For his heroism, 
Specialist Gurley was awarded a Bronze Star with Valor and the Purple 
Heart.

Madam Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of the 17th District of 
Illinois, I thank Specialist Gurley for saving the life of one of our 
beloved sons. Specialist Gurley and Specialist Eckley represent the 
best the United States military has to offer in Iraq. These two brave 
soldiers risked their lives to fight an unrelenting insurgency in one 
of our country's most dangerous areas. For their service, the American 
people will be forever indebted.

Madam Speaker, brave men such as Specialist Gurley and Specialist 
Eckley are hard to come by, so for their sake and for all those 
continuing to fight, it is my sincere hope that at the conclusion of 
this war their sacrifice will not be in vain.
