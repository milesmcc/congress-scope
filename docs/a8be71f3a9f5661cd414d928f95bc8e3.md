`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 1 November 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when most people get a letter from the 
IRS, they get scared. But the Democrats didn't even blink. They don't 
seem all that concerned about forcing 50 million Americans to write an 
interest-free loan to the Government in the form of unpaid tax returns 
worth about $75 billion--75 billion dollars. That is more than the 
gross domestic product of a hundred different countries--just sitting 
in the Treasury instead of the bank accounts and pockets of Americans 
who earned it.

Now, if this were the only thing Senate Democrats were 
procrastinating over, Americans would have reason enough to be angry. 
But it is not. It is just the latest in a string of core duties they 
promised they would address before election day but put back on the 
shelf after all the votes were counted.

Instead of fulfilling their campaign promises, they launched into a 
series of legislative misadventures that have put us 5 weeks into the 
new fiscal year with the same number of appropriations bills we started 
with, which is zero, a Justice Department with more empty offices than 
the Dirksen building in August, and no indication from anyone on the 
other side that any of this will change.

Regarding appropriations, the President has already said he will veto 
spending bills that exceed the budget request. Yet Democrats will now 
knowingly pass a Labor/HHS bill that exceeds the President's budget by 
billions of dollars and attach it to the MilCon/Veterans appropriations 
bill. We already know the result. These bills are coming right back to 
the Senate for a do-over. This is a waste of time, and just more of the 
same from a party that has been intent all year on using this Chamber 
as a stage for political theater rather than a workshop to actually get 
things accomplished.

Over at the Justice Department, Democrats have been clamoring for new 
leadership all year. The senior Senator from New York was the loudest 
of them all. More than 5 months ago, he told us ''the Nation needs a 
new Attorney General, and it can't afford to wait.'' The President 
responded in good faith by nominating the very man the senior Senator 
from New York recommended for the job.

Yet America has now waited longer for a vote on Michael Mukasey than 
on any other Attorney General nominee in decades. They have waited more 
than 40 days now. Compare that to Janet Reno, whose confirmation came 
less than 2 weeks after she was named.

Democrats have found plenty of time for votes that didn't matter. Now 
it is time to turn to votes that do. They found time for midnight votes 
on political Iraq resolutions. Now Americans are wondering when we will 
have a midnight vote to fix an error in the Tax Code that promises to 
leave more than one-third of them high and dry come April.

They found time for a vote on how we felt about the last Attorney 
General. Now people want to know when we will have the midnight vote on 
restoring leadership at the Justice Department.

They had the time to vote again and again to cut off funds to our 
troops in the field--voted on the Feingold amendment to cut off funds 
three times. Now Americans want to know when they will have a midnight 
vote to send the rest of the money to the troops--or on any one of the 
12 appropriations bills in a form that we can expect the President to 
sign.

This fixation on political gamesmanship has come at a serious cost. 
What we are seeing here goes far beyond mismanagement. And the American 
people have caught on. For the sake of the taxpayers, for the sake of 
the justice system, for the sake of the men and women who wear the 
uniform, it is time to put politics aside and do the work of today.

No more gimmicks, no more games. Time is short. The stakes are high. 
Let's get on with it.
