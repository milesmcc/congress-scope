Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to the nomination being taken up, let 
me say that I met General Petraeus in Iraq. At that time, the 
Republican leader was Senator Frist, who is a doctor, as we all know. 
General Petraeus said, ''I want you to take this back to Dr. Frist and 
remind him that he saved my life.'' There was a training exercise going 
on with live ammunition, and somebody tripped and fell with live 
ammunition and General Petraeus was shot in the heart. Dr. Frist saved 
his life. The surgery was complicated and important.

So I wish Senator/Dr. Frist were here today to be able to express his 
appreciation for General Petraeus. I brought that medal back from Iraq 
to give to Leader Frist and he remembered the surgery. He saved the 
life of a great man.
