Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res. 897 
recognizing the importance of teaching elementary and secondary school 
students about the sacrifices that veterans have made throughout the 
history of the Nation.

While this resolution is new to the House, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, 
Holland Elementary School has made a special effort to recognize 
veterans for years. In November 2001, in response to the terrorist 
attacks on September 11, 2001, Holland Elementary School started their 
annual Veterans Day Recognition Program.

Created by Principal Mike Caywood (a Vietnam veteran himself) and 
music teacher Jane Zweinink, the Veterans Day Recognition Program 
invites veterans to come to Holland Elementary on Veterans Day and 
share their stories with students. Principal Caywood has invited 
veterans from all over the local community and specifically veterans 
from local senior care homes. Ms. Zweinink has taught students 
patriotic songs that are performed for guests when they came to school. 
The veterans have enjoyed seeing the students perform, singing songs 
and sharing their patriotic message.

Over the years, Holland Elementary has seen a decrease in the number 
of World War II vets attending and the Korean and Vietnam vets are 
getting older. In response, the school has proactively reached out to 
veterans from Desert Storm, Iraq and Afghanistan. They have also had an 
increase in the number of active duty soldiers participating, including 
mothers and fathers of students. Many of these veterans come from the 
school system itself. Fort Wayne Community Schools currently employs 
over 100 veterans.

Holland Elementary's Veterans Day Recognition Program is a great 
example of how H. Res. 897 can be implemented. I want to thank Mr. 
Caywood and Ms. Zweinink for their hard work in recognizing local 
veterans and making sure elementary students understand the sacrifices 
of generations before them.

I yield back the balance of my time.
