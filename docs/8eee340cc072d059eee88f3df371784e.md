Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
because today marks the 4-year anniversary of the war in Iraq. I would 
like to offer a moment of silence for the 19 members of my unit that 
did not make it home from Iraq, and for the thousands of brave 
Americans that have fallen.

On this somber occasion, we must commit ourselves to honoring the 
memories of the fallen, and continue to do right by our troops still 
fighting.
