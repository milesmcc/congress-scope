Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, Texas' mothers have sent more sons and 
daughters overseas for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
Freedom than any other state in America. We have endured more 
casualties than any other state but one.

The American Gold Star Mothers in Texas and throughout this great 
nation have suffered the supreme sacrifice of motherhood by losing a 
child who served in the Armed Forces, and thus perpetuate the memory of 
all whose lives are sacrificed in war. Their sons and daughters served 
their country honorably and gave what Lincoln called ''last full 
measure of devotion.''

To these soldiers, we are grateful and humbled by their sacrifice. 
And to the Gold Star Mothers who have lost children our thoughts and 
prayers are with you always.
