Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the service of 
General Casey and speak in support of his confirmation as Chief of 
Staff of the Army.

General Casey has had a long and distinguished career. After his 
graduation from Georgetown University in 1970, he received his 
commission and served in the mechanized infantry. During his career, he 
has commanded the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division and acted as 
the assistant division commander of the 1st Armored Division. In 1999, 
General Casey assumed command of the 1st Armored Division. 
Additionally, General Casey has served as Director of Strategic Plans 
and Policy at the Pentagon and as Director of the Joint Staff.

As we all know, General Casey has most recently served as the 
commander of Multi-National Forces--Iraq. As commander of our forces in 
Iraq, General Casey faced extremely difficult issues everyday.

I believe General Casey to be a good man, and I would like to again 
congratulate him on his promotion and thank him for his continued 
service to our country. I look forward to working with him while he 
serves as Chief of Staff of the Army.
