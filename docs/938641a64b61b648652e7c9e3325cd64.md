`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 7 February 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. Just a final point. Madam President, the Senator has 
stated it well. Basically, the recommendations of those generals I 
mentioned--and General Abizaid said he had inquired of all the combat 
commanders--all of the combat commanders--whether there should be an 
enhanced presence in Baghdad, and he testified before the Armed 
Services Committee that we should not.

But isn't the point the Senator is making is to underline what all of 
the generals have said and Maliki has said; that is, it is a political 
resolution, it is a political decision? What we are seeing now is 
resorting to a military solution when the independent study commission, 
the generals on the ground, and the political leaders in that country 
have said what is necessary now is a political resolution, a political 
decision, and we find an administration that has effectively discarded 
that as an option and is going to the military option.

As I understand, the Senator believes we ought to have a political 
resolution, political courage by the parties in power there; that we 
here and the U.S. troops can't care more about the freedom of the 
Iraqis than the Iraqi people and they have to stand up, step up, and be 
willing to make their judgments.
