`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 9 April 2008`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say briefly, I wish to offer my 
congratulations, along with those of others, to both General Petraeus 
and Ambassador Crocker for their astonishingly good work over the last 
9 to 12 months. In virtually every measurable way that you can look at 
Iraq, conditions have dramatically improved. That is a direct result of 
the smart military strategy that has put Iraq in a position where it 
can realistically aspire to be a relatively normal country by the 
standards of the Middle East and certainly an ally on the war on 
terror, which is extremely important.

I also think it is important for all of us to remember we have not 
been attacked here at home for almost 7 years--a direct result of the 
strategy of getting on the offense and pushing back against those who 
would attack us here at home, which we have done both in Afghanistan 
and in Iraq.

So it was an opportunity, with the appearance of the general and the 
ambassador, to congratulate them for their outstanding work over the 
last year. We look forward to going forward in Iraq in a way that 
leaves behind a stable country that can make a positive contribution to 
the security of the United States here at home and in the Middle East.

I yield the floor.
