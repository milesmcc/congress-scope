Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the kind remarks 
of Senator Schumer with regard to a proposal I have made. For the 
public's edification and amplification, nobody over here is just saying 
no, except the majority leader just said no to offering our amendments 
to the stimulus package we want cloture on. What we are going through 
right now are some gymnastics and the gymnastics are this. Members on 
both sides of the aisle want to do something because we do recognize 
there is a housing problem, because there are ways we can help the 
American public. But you can't address all those ways if you don't 
allow all those ideas to be debated as a part of the amendment process 
on the legislation.

So I appreciate the kind remarks of the Senator regarding my 
proposal, but a favorable comment doesn't do us any good if you can't 
offer the amendment on the floor. I don't think I have all the good 
ideas. I don't think they have all the good ideas. I think, 
collectively, we probably do have all the good ideas. But this is not 
about just saying no. This is us saying yes to a process that is open, 
a process that is debatable, a process where we can reach out and try 
and help the American people, particularly those who are having great 
difficulty because of the housing market today.

So I wished to throw that in. My remarks were intended to be about 
Iraq, which I am going to close with, but I had to respond to the 
statements the Senator from New York made.
