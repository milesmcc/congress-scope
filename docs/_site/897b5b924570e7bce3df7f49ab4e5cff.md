Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the people of Ashe 
County, North Carolina, for their strong support for our men and women 
in uniform.

Any time there is an opportunity to honor our active military and our 
veterans, such as Memorial Day or Veterans Day, the folks in Ashe 
County show their support in the strongest way possible. But on August 
23rd of this year, Ashe County hosted its Armed Forces Tribute and 
showed what a remarkable place Ashe County is and how remarkable the 
people there are.

This event was a fitting way to honor our country's brave veterans 
and those who are serving around the world to keep our Nation safe. 
True to the organizers' goal for the event, it was a time to reflect on 
the sacrifices of those who


willingly put their lives on the line for the cause of freedom. It made 
me proud once again to be an American and proud to represent the fine 
people of Ashe County who made this special time possible.

The Armed Forces Tribute was broadcast worldwide to military 
personnel by the military's Pentagon Channel and aired across the State 
of North Carolina on public television's UNC-TV. The use of technology 
that day in this small county in western North Carolina was phenomenal. 
It was a proud day in Ashe County for those who serve our Nation.

The tribute was filled with memorable moments of honoring those who 
serve and have served in our military. Lieutenant General Thomas F. 
Metz gave a stirring speech that will not soon be forgotten. North 
Carolina's own 82nd Airborne parachuted from the skies over Ashe 
County, not once but twice during the celebration.

And participants were even connected via satellite to our troops 
serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, family members came from all 
over the United States to be able to talk electronically with their 
member serving in the military overseas. And once again we heard the 
extremely articulate men and women serving in the military describe 
their experiences and their positive outlook on what is happening in 
Iraq in particular, and all of us were extremely pleased to hear that.

Were it not for the generous spirit of patriotism and volunteerism of 
the people of the High Country, this event would not have been 
possible. I would like to thank everyone who gave their time and their 
money to ensure the success of the Armed Forces Tribute.

But there is someone who deserves special thanks and recognition for 
the passion and dedication she brings to make this tribute happen. 
Vicky Moody, president of the Jefferson, North Carolina, Rotary Club, 
once again brought the people of Ashe County together to pull off a 
spectacular salute to our troops and led her fellow Rotarians, who 
served as volunteers for this event, in the cause.

Thank you, Vicky, for your work and your love of country and our 
military men and women. Thank you, Jefferson Rotarians, for all of the 
work, effort and money that you put into making this a wonderful event.

It is always fitting to honor those who put their lives on the line 
for our Nation and make tremendous sacrifices for our freedom, and 
today is no exception. Thank you to our veterans, their families, and 
to the patriotic Americans like Vicky Moody and Ashe County who stand 
behind our active duty military as they defend the front lines of the 
fight for liberty. May God continue to bless you, and may God continue 
to bless the United States of America.
