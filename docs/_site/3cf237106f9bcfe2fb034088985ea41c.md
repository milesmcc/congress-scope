Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 4454) to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 3050 Hunsinger Lane in Louisville, 
Kentucky, as the ''Iraq and Afghanistan Fallen Military Heroes of 
Louisville Memorial Post Office Building'', in honor of the service men 
and women from Louisville, Kentucky, who died in service during 
Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
