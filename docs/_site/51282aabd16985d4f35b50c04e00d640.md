`Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois â€” 16 October 2007`

---


Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately today, October 
16, 2007, I was unable to cast my votes on H. Res. 734, H.R. 2295, and 
H. Con. Res. 182 and wish the Record to reflect my intentions had I 
been able to vote.

Had I been present for rollcall No. 969 on passing H. Res. 734, 
expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
withholding of information relating to corruption in Iraq, I would have 
''aye.''

Had I been present for rollcall No. 970 on suspending the rules and 
passing H.R. 2295, the ALS Registry Act, I would have voted ''aye.''

Had I been present for rollcall No. 971 on suspending the rules and 
passing H. Con. Res. 182, supporting the goals and ideals of National 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week, I would have voted 
''aye.''
