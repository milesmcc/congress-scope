Mr. McCAIN. Excuse me--sailor, and later in the Marine Corps. He went 
wrong--I mean he did very well by serving both in the U.S. Navy and the 
U.S. Marine Corps, and then, of course, as Assistant Secretary of the 
Navy and as an outstanding chairman of the Armed Services Committee. So 
I thank him for his in-depth analysis, I thank him for his leadership 
and guidance to all of us and to all of our citizens, and for a very 
thoughtful and persuasive discussion.

As we move forward on this issue, no matter what happens with the 
Webb amendment, we will be faced with the situation in Iraq. I hope the 
situation improves and these debates can be eliminated over time. I am 
not sure they can. I hope and pray they can, but in the meantime we 
will rely on the judgment and guidance of our friend from Virginia.
