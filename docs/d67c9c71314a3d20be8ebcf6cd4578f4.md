`Mrs. MALONEY of New York â€” 27 July 2007`

Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 2929, a bill that would ensure that no permanent U.S. military 
bases are established in Iraq. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I 
believe that H.R. 2929 sends an important message to the Iraqi people 
that we respect their sovereignty. We can take the wind out of the 
sails of extremists and insurgents who benefit enormously from the 
Iraqi public perception that the United States intends to maintain 
permanent bases and troop presence within the nation.

In December 2006 the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommended that the 
United States clearly state that our Nation does not seek permanent 
bases in Iraq or to control Iraq's oil. We must speak out now to show 
the Iraqi people and the international community that we support full 
sovereignty for Iraq, entrusted to a functioning Iraqi government. 
Although this body previously has approved provisions banning permanent 
bases in Iraq, these provisions are due to expire on September 30, 
2007. H.R. 2929 would make this ban permanent.

Congress has made clear that there should be no permanent U.S. bases 
in Iraq, despite the Administration's warnings for a prolonged military 
presence in Iraq. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
