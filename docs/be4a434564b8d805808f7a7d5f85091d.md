`Mr. EMANUEL â€” 3 October 2007`

Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, the President has asked for another 190 
billion more dollars for the war in Iraq. That's 190 billion more 
dollars for more of the same.

For 41 days for the cost of the war, 10 million American children 
would get their health care. For 1 month for the cost of the war, 7/1/
2/ million American children would get their health care. And for 1 
week for the cost of this war, 2/1/2/ million would get their health 
care.

The President is asking for an open-ended, open-wallet commitment to 
Iraq, and the American children get an empty stocking.

Meanwhile, under the President's own plan, 1 million American 
children would lose their health care, according to the experts. Nearly 
1 million children would create a very long line in America's emergency 
rooms. The emergency rooms are President Bush's answer to America's 
health care crisis.

Seventy-two percent of Americans support our reauthorization of the 
children's health care bill. The President and 15 Republicans stand in 
the way of 10 million children receiving the health care that we 
receive here as Members of Congress.

There have been three vetoes in President Bush's term: one to end the 
war, one to permit stem cell research, and now one to allow 10 million 
children to get their health care. That says it all about President 
Bush.
