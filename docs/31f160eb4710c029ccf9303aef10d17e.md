Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me just echo the remarks of the 
majority leader. We are continuing to discuss the consent request under 
which we would consider various options for our Iraq debate beginning 
next week. We are making substantial progress and, hopefully, we will 
have something soon to announce on that issue.
