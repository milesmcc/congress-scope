Mr. BARROW. I thank the gentlelady for yielding her leadership on 
this issue.

Madam Speaker, in October of 2009, the Army Corps of Engineers used 
temporary funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to 
begin the Veterans' Curation project to employ and train wounded Iraq 
and Afghanistan veterans in archeological processing. The project gives 
these veterans an opportunity to learn transferable job skills and earn 
a fair wage while cataloging artifacts that the Corps has discovered 
and is required to preserve. The project now employs about 50 veterans 
in Augusta, Georgia; St. Louis, Missouri; and Washington, D.C.

Unfortunately, temporary funding for the Veterans' Curation project 
is set to run out just when our returning veterans and our economy need 
it the most. H.R. 5282 provides long-term authorization for the program 
and will preserve the program and allow it to grow.

The Veterans' Curation project not only helps educate, train, and 
employ veterans, but it allows them to heal through the power of 
meaningful work. Since the Army Corps of Engineers has to catalog these 
artifacts anyway, there can be no better qualified or more deserving 
group than our own veterans to help get the job done. We owe no debt as 
citizens that is greater than the debt we owe to the veterans who 
fought for our freedoms. We literally owe them everything.

That is why I urge my colleagues to support this worthy program to 
help our wounded veterans heal and get good job skills at the same 
time. It's not only the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do.
