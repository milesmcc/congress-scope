`Mrs. CLINTON â€” 11 January 2007`

Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the honorable 
and heroic actions demonstrated by the late Marine Cpl Jason Dunham of 
Scio, NY.

Today, the President of the United States presented the Medal of 
Honor, the Nation's highest decoration for combat heroism, to the 
family of Cpl Jason Dunham during a ceremony in the White House.

Cpl Jason Dunham was 22 years old in mid-April of 2004 and serving in 
Husaybah, Iraq. An Iraqi terrorist attacked Dunham, and Dunham 
selflessly acted to shield his squad members from a hand grenade blast. 
The blast severely wounded Dunham and he was flown to Bethesda Naval 
Hospital outside of Washington, DC where he died April 22, 2004.

Corporal Dunham is the first marine to earn the Medal of Honor in 
more than 30 years and one of only two U.S. service members to be 
awarded the medal since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began.

Corporal Dunham's actions in Iraq were truly humbling and worthy of 
the greatest honor. This medal is a fitting tribute to a true hero who 
made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of his Nation and the marines 
with whom he proudly served.

I was honored to have sponsored the legislation last year to 
designate the U.S. Postal Service facility located at 4422 West Sciota 
Street in Scio, NY, as the ''Corporal Jason L. Dunham Post Office''.

Today, as their son is honored as the incredible hero that he was, I 
send my thoughts and prayers to Corporal Dunham's family and to all the 
brave men and women of our Armed Forces.
