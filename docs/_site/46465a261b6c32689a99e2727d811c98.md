`Mr. SESSIONS â€” 18 December 2007`

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we know what the situation is, and we 
are a great nation. We are not at liberty to flip-flop around every 
time there is some change afoot in some polling data. We voted this 
summer 80 to 14 to give General Petraeus a chance. We funded the surge 
and we funded his new strategy. At the time we did that, things were 
not going well in Iraq. We had a tough year, there is no doubt about 
it. In the last few months and in the last few weeks, we have seen 
dramatic changes under the surge and under the classic 
counterinsurgency strategy this brilliant general is conducting. So I 
say let's allow him to conduct this war. Let's allow General Petraeus, 
a proven leader, to do so. Let's reject the tactical decisions of 
''General'' Feingold and ''General'' Kennedy. We have a professional 
there who is achieving things beyond what I would have thought possible 
a few months ago, actually. I hoped and believed we were going to see 
progress, but the extent of it is remarkable.

The last thing we need to do is to take action to pull the rug out 
from under the fabulous men and women who are serving us at great risk 
this very moment, whose highest and deepest wish is to be successful, 
to execute the policy we gave them by a three-fourths-plus vote several 
years ago.

I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of the time.
