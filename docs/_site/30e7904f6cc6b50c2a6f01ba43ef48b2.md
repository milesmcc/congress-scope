`Mr. KYL â€” 20 September 2007`

---


Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in view of the fact that there are a series 
of other speakers who wish to address this matter, I am going to ask 
unanimous consent to put an article in the Record to respond to one of 
the arguments that has been made, and then I will briefly respond to 
the others.

To the point that this is a civil war in Iraq and that is the 
justification for American forces being withdrawn, I ask unanimous 
consent that an article by Frederick Kagan entitled ''Al Qaeda in 
Iraq,'' dated September 10 and appearing in the Weekly Standard, be 
printed in the Record after my comments.
