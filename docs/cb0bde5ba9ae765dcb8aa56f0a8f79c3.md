`Mr. BERMAN â€” 11 June 2009`

Mr. BERMAN. I made a mistake earlier. I objected to the reading of 
the motion to recommit. I should have asked for a reading of the bill. 
As much as I admire the gentleman, the one thing that is clear to me 
from his comments is he didn't read the bill.

We have absolutely no conditions or restrictions or efforts to 
earmark or tie up any of the economic assistance in this bill. Why you 
would say that is only because someone told you that. Because when you 
look at the bill, we have some principles, we have suggestions, we lay 
out things that need to be done to build democratic institutions in 
Pakistan, to build a school system.

We know that we are providing up to $12 billion, much of it in 
economic assistance for schools that have no teachers. We're providing 
money for teachers who have no education and don't know how to teach 
science and math. So we suggest in this bill some guidelines and tie no 
one's hands. We don't tie the Secretary's hands; we don't tie the 
Pakistanis' hands.

Now, the state of play is that when we put together our Pakistan 
bill, we went to the minority and said, let's work on a Pakistan/
Afghanistan bill. They weren't interested. The problem with the 
minority's way to do a motion to recommit is the leadership meets in 
some office--they don't bring in the Republicans from the committee--
and they come up with a motion to recommit, let's join Afghanistan with 
Pakistan. We've been trying to do that for 4 months in our committee, 
but the minority didn't want to do it that way.



And by the way, we just had a little vote. We had a vote on a 
Republican substitute that, on security assistance, had no monitoring 
provisions, no auditing provisions, no evaluation provisions. This is 
in the context of $12 billion that's been spent, a huge amount on 
reimbursements for which there are no receipts for money, that we 
cannot find what it went for. If you like what's been going on there, 
you're praising the right of Pakistan to do what it wants to do.

When Musharraf kept making appeasement agreements with different 
elements of the Taliban, was that a wise thing to be encouraging? I 
don't think so. The only thing we provide any benchmarks on is the 
security assistance. And what we say there is, Mr. President, look at 
how that money is being spent and make a determination whether or not 
Pakistan has a commitment--that they are now, by the way, 
demonstrating--to combating the insurgency and fighting the terrorists, 
and whether they're making progress. And are they cooperating in the 
efforts to dismantle the proliferation regime, and are they doing 
things to secure it? And, Mr. President, you make the determination and 
you make the decision.

We have worked with the leadership of the Armed Services Committee to 
make sure that the security assistance gets to the Pakistani military 
as quickly as possible, but not equipment that has nothing to do with 
the counterinsurgency. We want the equipment, the helicopters, the 
night-vision goggles, the training, the IMET programs to go as fast as 
they can. So in our bill, not in yours, but in our bill we waive all 
the traditions that now exist on traditional security assistance 
programs.

So this is a motion to recommit that includes an Afghan bill that 
says, continue as usual, where the lack of end-use monitoring has meant 
that we have been arming the Taliban because they steal the guns we 
provide and use them against our forces and the Afghan forces, and 
repeat in toto the Republican substitute we just rejected.

Let's vote against it. We did it once; let's do it again. Let's try 
to reestablish some sense of bipartisan collaboration. These 
differences aren't that great. We can work them out if the majority and 
the minority cooperate. I say, as the chairman of the committee with 
jurisdiction over these issues, I would love to put together a 
bipartisan approach. Maybe we can start working on that for the 
conference committee.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
