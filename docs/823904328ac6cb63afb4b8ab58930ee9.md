`Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico â€” 14 February 2007`

Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I wonder if my colleague from 
Massachusetts, given his comments about the resolution and the support 
for the troops we are deploying, would join me in a unanimous concept 
request to amend the resolution to express our intent and the intent of 
this House to support those in the U.S. Armed Forces who are serving 
and who will serve in Iraq.
