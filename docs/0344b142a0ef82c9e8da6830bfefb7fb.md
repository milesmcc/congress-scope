Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, my colleagues, yes, we're looking at an 
anniversary of Iraq here. But let's talk about things that the American 
people can relate to immediately. Cost of eggs going up 35 percent in 
the last year, cost of milk going up about 23 percent, bread going up 
about 16 percent.

Now we know that Americans going to the gas pump are paying near $4 a 
gallon in many areas.

What does this all have to do with Iraq?

Well, we're in Iraq for oil. The oil companies are running our 
domestic energy policy. It's having an impact on the price of food. 
It's causing a great transfer of wealth upwards away from the working 
people and the middle class of this country into the hands of a few 
wealthy oil company owners.

We need to get out of Iraq. We need to end the occupation, close the 
bases, bring the troops home. We need to set in motion an international 
security and peacekeeping force that can stabilize Iraq as our troops 
leave.

We need to start taking care of things here at home. Americans are 
losing their homes, they're losing their jobs, they're losing their 
health care, they're losing their retirement security. It's time we 
started to take care of things here at home and get out of Iraq.
