Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I thank the distinguished gentleman. Let me 
quickly thank you for your leadership and thank the ranking member of 
our Committee on Foreign Affairs, who I know is involved in this 
action.

And let me applaud the approach. That's what I want to reaffirm. 
Diplomatic and economic sanctions have not been used effectively 
against Iran. And with the more publicized National Intelligence 
Estimates that indicates that terrorism is franchising around the 
world, the troubling activities of Iran with Iraq and the actions that 
seem to be moving Iran toward nuclear creativity, if you will, warrants 
a strong statement by the United States. And it also is warranted 
because of the active middle class who wants a democratic and free 
Iran.

This is a right way to go. It is a different approach from a military 
strike and the representations of this administration about attacking 
Iran militarily. The American people want to see us act, and I believe 
that this legislation dealing with a list of those investing and giving 
guidance to the economic sector is the right direction to take.

And I am also grateful that this does not preempt State law and 
States that


have already gone further in divestment.

So I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I hope my colleagues will 
support this legislation
