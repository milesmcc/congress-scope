`Mr. THUNE â€” 12 April 2007`

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Alabama 
because I think it is an important point to make--I have heard the 
debate here a lot, and, again, as it continues in this city and across 
the country, that there has to be a political or diplomatic solution 
that somehow we have to reach; the sides have to come together, which I 
do not disagree with. However, I would also argue, in order for that to 
happen, you have to have security. You cannot have a functioning 
democracy or government absent security; in the last several hours, a 
couple of lawmakers in Iraq were killed in the Green Zone.

How is a government to function, how is a political process to work, 
if there is not adequate security, which is the point I believe many of 
us have made all along. I say to my colleague from Alabama, there has 
to be not only a political solution, but there has to be security 
established. That is what this new strategy is designed to accomplish, 
to allow that process to work. We ought to allow this strategy an 
opportunity to work, rather than pass bills out of here that tie the 
hands of the President, tie the hands of our generals, substitute the 
judgment of politicians in Washington for the judgment of our generals 
in the field. Furthermore, we need to get funding to our troops.

So I think the Senator from Alabama has put it very eloquently, and I 
join him in urging the rest of our colleagues in the Senate--and, 
obviously, hopefully, very soon in the House--to get this process 
wrapped up, to get a bill to the President that he will ultimately 
veto, send it back here, start over again, and let's at least get the 
funding to our troops so we can get this situation in Iraq secure so 
this political process can function and work and, hopefully, create a 
stable democracy.
