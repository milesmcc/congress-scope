# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `01a61e0ef8d592c900f79c7102bb48f7`
`Mr. SHIMKUS â€” 15 February 2007`

---


Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, these are real e-mails from veterans, 
active duty members, and National Guard and Reservists:

''John, my son, a Marine gunny sergeant embedded with the Iraqi Army 
around Rimadi, called a few weeks ago. I asked him if he knew about the 
President's plan for more troops. He hadn't heard about it, but his 
only comment to me was 'We can use them.' Please support the President 
and the troops. It may be our last, best chance to win this thing. 
Winning is the imperative. Semper Fi.''

And another: ''We have to let our generals be generals and wage this 
war as only they are trained to do and have hope that the announced 
troop buildup will be the final key that is needed by the Iraqis to 
build a secure, united country.''



We have to hope that it is not too late for the U.S. to make a 
difference in Iraq.''

Another: ''We need to send the message to our troops that America 
wants them to succeed in Iraq by giving the buildup a chance to 
succeed.''

Still another: ''My fellow Guardsmen are ready. We will do whatever 
is asked of us. Please ensure that the resources, funds and equipment 
continue to flow. Supporting the troops means giving us the means to do 
our job.''

And another: ''We also need to stay in Iraq and put forth the 
necessary will and resources that will allow our strategy to succeed.''



And another: ''Moreover, our troops need more open rules of 
engagement to do their job effectively.''

Another e-mail: ''Elections have consequences, and for our recent 
election the consequences have been a major setback in the war on 
terror and a greater threat to terrorist attack at home.''

Still another: ''Like Vietnam, our enemies view us as not having the 
stomach to fight a protracted war. If we withdraw, however, the 
credibility of the U.S., our military, and our assurances would be lost 
for years, probably decades.''

Another: ''The overwhelming response among officers is we must stay 
and finish what we have started. Many of these officers have built 
strong relationships with local Iraqi and Afghan citizens who want to 
raise their family in peace.''

Another: ''We do in fact have many more Iraqi Army and National 
Police units moving into Baghdad and many are effectively partnering 
with U.S. units.''

Another: ''They did pass their budget for 2007 last week,'' sooner 
than the U.S. Congress, incidentally, ''and have made some progress 
with other legislation, which indicates they can work some political 
compromises.''

I will end with this: ''I would hope that your colleagues would be 
able to continue to support what we are doing, because it honestly does 
have a reasonable chance at success.''

These are real communications with real soldiers, Active Duty, in 
Iraq, National Guardsmen, reservists, and veterans throughout our 
country who say there is no substitute for victory. We have to win this 
campaign. It is in our national security interest to support moderate 
Arab states.

John, my son, a Marine Gunny Sgt. imbedded with the Iraqi army around 
Rimadi, called a few weeks ago. I asked him if he knew about the 
President's plan for more troops. He hadn't heard about it, but his 
only comment to me was: ''We can use them!'' Please support the 
President and the Troops. Maybe our last, best chance to win this 
thing. Winning is the imperative. Semper Fi!

We have to let our generals be generals and wage this war as only 
they are trained to do, and have hope that the announced troop buildup 
will be the final 3 key that's needed by the Iraqis to build a secure 
and united country.

We have to have hope that it's not too late for the U.S. to make a 
difference in Iraq.

We need to send the message to our troops that America wants them to 
succeed in Iraq by giving the buildup a chance to succeed.

The main effort is really the political reconciliation and the 
security of the population is the key precondition to that. The 
language and some action from the Iraqi government and Army leaders 
have been good in the past several weeks. The next several months will 
be critical--probably decisive--and I believe there is reason to be 
realistically hopeful.

I believe that what we are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan supports the 
NSS. What I have heard in the debate is that we no longer have a 
security interest in Iraq. What part of out NSS is to support moderate 
Muslim governments? Another part of the NSS addresses humanitarian 
rights, to include rights of women.

My fellow Guardsmen are ready. We will do whatever is asked of us. 
Please, ensure that the resources, funds and equipment, continue to 
flow. Supporting the troops means giving us the means to do our jobs.

We have not had a failed Iraq policy--we have just had overly 
optimistic expectations of how fast the Iraqis would be able to 
establish a stable government and a unified country that functions in a 
manner to our satisfaction. Ironically, we want the Iraqis to pursue a 
unity government and national reconciliation, but we don't do that 
ourselves. The partisanship that we are seeing here in the U.S. is no 
different that the partisanship that we are seeing in Iraq.


We also need to stay in Iraq and put forth the necessary will and 
resources that will allow our strategy to succeed. Imagine a Super Bowl 
football team quitting the game in the third quarter simply because 
they were behind. The premise is so absurd it is inconceivable so too 
would be our quitting a war to protect our way of life simply because 
battlefield conditions are not going perfectly.

Moreover, our troops need more open rules of engagement to do their 
job effectively. This is war, and they are soldiers, not police 
officers. The U.S. and Iraqi governments must expect civilian 
casualties and collateral damage. It's unavoidable. The irony in this 
matter is that most Iraqi people would welcome the increase security.

Elections have consequences. And for our recent election, the 
consequences have been a major set back in the war on terror and a 
greater threat to terrorist attack at home.

Like Vietnam, our enemies view us as not having the stomach to fight 
a protracted war. If we withdraw, however, the credibility of the U.S., 
our military, and our assurances would be lost for years, probably 
decades.

The Iraqis are watching all of this, and they can see which way the 
wind is blowing. They know if we leave either the Sunni insurgency or 
the Iranians would likely come in, and their newly gained freedoms 
would be lost. This reality shapes the thoughts and actions of all 
Iraqi officials, from Prime Minister al-Maliki, down to the police 
officers on the street.


Many Americans are in denial about the threat from radical Islam. 
Unfortunately, it may take another 9/11 before they wake up. God help 
us if one of our cities gets nuked when that happens.

The overwhelming response among officers is that we must stay and 
finish what we started. Many of these officers have built strong 
relationships with local Iraqi and Afghan citizens who want to raise 
their families in peace. They feel we have given our word as a country 
that we will stand by them. I agree with this sentiment.

Lincoln/Sherman figured out that to truly defeat the south, he had to 
march to Savannah to convince the locals that it was not worth 
continued conflict. WWII had similar actions for resolution like 
Hiroshima. While these were waged against conventional forces, Congress 
must understand that the current conflict is more than between 
insurgents and U.S./Coalition forces.

If we do not have the will to do this hard work, we need to get out 
now. We cannot continue to try to get the job done with the minimum 
force. If anything we should send more than we think we need. Our focus 
on being liberators has caused us to misjudge what is needed. You 
cannot liberate until you have gained control. We never got there and 
must do so now.

Speaking of which, my two cents. The most basic job of government is 
to protect its citizens. If the Surge is properly designed to do that, 
then it is a good idea. I say give it a chance, even though it should 
have been that way to begin with. From my experiences in Desert Storm 
'91, I firmly believe that most people, Middles Easterners included, 
just want to protect their family, practice their religion, and have an 
opportunity to prosper.


We have to be able to go after all the killers regardless of who or 
where they are. The Iraqi follow-on forces then have to maintain the 
peace, not bring in their individual hatreds to the power vacuum. 
Helping them secure their borders from fighters through Jordan and 
Syria and equipment from Iran is also critical (Navy and Air Force 
tasks with limited ground support?). Getting the ''Rule of Law'' 
established will eventually replace the need for ''Self Protection'' 
(Militias).

The biggest hurdle is at home. If the media continues its selective 
reporting (failures only), then even if its an unqualified success on 
the ground, it will be perceived as a loss at home due to its depiction 
on TV and Press reports. Tying Iraqis to a yardstick measuring success 
or failure seems to be a good idea.

Press the Senate not to pass the latest Resolution limiting support--
it is just a grand standing event for presidential hopefuls.

We do in fact have many more Iraqi Army and National Police units 
moving into Baghdad and many are effectively partnering with U.S. 
units.


They did pass their budget for 2007 last week (sooner than the U.S. 
Congress, incidentally) and have made some progress with other 
legislation, which indicates they can work some political compromises.

Everyone is forced to telescope political, economic, and security 
reforms that would normally take 7-10 years into 7-10 months.

So the question that you are debating is whether or not $100 billions 
(less than 0.8% GDP) and tragically, probably 700-900 U.S. soldiers' 
lives is worth a 50% chance of preventing a national security crisis 
that will set back U.S. policy for decades.

If you are the parent or spouse of one of those soldiers who may die, 
it is GD probably not worth it. But if you are a national leader, I 
would hope that your colleagues would be able to continue to support 
what we are doing because it honestly does have a reasonable chance of 
success.
