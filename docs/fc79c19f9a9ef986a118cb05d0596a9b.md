`Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 6 February 2007`

Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. I so often hear that cut and run is a 
strategy from Democrats. That is not the case. When we finished the war 
in 1945, military bases were established in western Europe, in Turkey 
and other places throughout the world. They are still there. As we 
finished our endeavors, as many people thought during the Korean War, 
our military bases are still located in South Korea.

We will never leave the Middle East, if the American people think 
that is the case. What we are talking about is being able to redeploy 
and do certain other endeavors that have not been done to make sure we 
win this war, win the peace, and have success in Iraq. We will be in 
the Middle East for a long, long time. My great-grandchildren will 
still see us be there. That is an area in which we have to defend 
America's freedom and liberty.

But we have got to take another look at having success, because what 
we are doing now is not having the success the American people demand, 
expect and we should have for them, and our troops deserve better than 
that.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remaining portion of my time.
