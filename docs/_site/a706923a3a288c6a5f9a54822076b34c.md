`Mrs. HUTCHISON â€” 15 November 2007`

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the bridge 
fund bill that passed the House of Representatives last night. I don't 
know why it has to be so hard to pass an emergency supplemental to 
assure that our troops in the field get the money they need to support 
them in the job we are asking them to do.

The President has asked for almost $200 billion to get us through 
some point in January or possibly into the spring. But the bill that 
has come over is roughly in the $50 billion range and it has all kinds 
of constraints and strings and mandates from the Congress.

Our military strategies should not be determined by events 6,000 
miles from the theater where our young men and women have boots on the 
ground. This bridge fund bill is the latest attempt in a year-long 
effort to constrain the ability of our generals and our brave men and 
women in uniform to fight this war effectively.

During the past year, the Senate has been forced to vote 40 times on 
bills limiting the generals' war strategy. None of those bills passed 
but one, and it was vetoed.

Since this assembly line of bills started last February, the 
situation in Iraq has changed so much. General Petraeus has implemented 
a strategic readjustment that has produced encouraging progress. Last 
week, U.S. commanders and the Iraqi Government proclaimed that al-Qaida 
had been routed in every neighborhood in Baghdad, citing an 80-percent 
drop in the murder rate since its peak.

The British Broadcasting Corporation reports:




 All across Baghdad . . . streets are springing back to 


 life. Shops and restaurants which closed down are back in 


 business. People walk in crowded streets in the evening, 


 where just a few months ago they would have been huddled 


 behind locked doors in their homes.


This is from the BBC.

Some 67,000 Iraqis have joined U.S.-organized citizens watch groups. 
Roadside bomb attacks have receded to a 3-year low, while finds of 
weapons caches have doubled in the last year. The progress has been so 
impressive that General Petraeus has recommended a drawdown of troops 
because conditions on the ground merit such action.

In the last 10 months, so much has changed in Iraq, and yet on the 
floor of the Senate, nothing has changed at all. We are still voting on 
bills for premature withdrawal, not taking into consideration what is 
happening on the ground, even when victory is in sight.

This is a new day in Iraq, and the Senate should recognize that fact 
by providing a vote of confidence in our generals instead of 
threatening to pull the rug out from under them.

If there are Senators who believe the war is lost, they should vote 
to defund the war instead of threatening to tie the hands of our 
commanders which would needlessly endanger our troops.

We know from our troops in the field that we must keep our 
commitment. This war has been costly for America in lives and dollars. 
The consequences of failure, after all we have spent in our treasure 
and our young men and women, would be catastrophic. If we abandon Iraq 
prematurely, it will become a sanctuary for terrorists, and they will 
launch attacks on the American people.



There is also a real danger that Iraq could become a satellite of 
Iran. The Iranian Government has a long record of sponsoring terrorism 
and arming the insurgents who are killing our brave soldiers in Iraq.

For all these reasons, we cannot abandon Iraq. We can leave when the 
generals say it is safe to leave because Iraq will be stable, that it 
will not be a terrorist training ground, and that is the only way we 
can leave Iraq, if we are to uphold the integrity of the United States 
of America.

We must persevere and succeed in this war, just as generations before 
us have done when we fought and defeated fascism, communism, and 
nazism. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guard have 
sacrificed greatly to keep us safe and free, and we must support them 
in this mission. The mission of a stable Iraq rather than a breeding 
ground for terrorists must be accomplished.

The bill is coming to the Senate from the House which passed it after 
a long, arduous debate last night. I urge my colleagues not to do 
something that would so damage the integrity of the United States of 
America and hurt our troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan by 
putting them in danger by underfunding them, by not giving them the 
vote of confidence they deserve. It would be unthinkable.

Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a 
quorum.
