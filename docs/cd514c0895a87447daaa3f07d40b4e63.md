`Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, February 
13th, I was unavoidably delayed and was unable to cast a vote on H. 
Res. 157 Providing for consideration of the concurrent resolution (H. 
Con. Res. 63) disapproving of the decision of the President announced 
on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United 
States combat troops to Iraq.

I would like the Record to reflect that if I had not been delayed, I 
would have voted ''no'' on H. Res. 157.
