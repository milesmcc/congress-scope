Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering tonight 
provides $400 million towards new construction projects. This money 
will be used to put American workers, pipe fitters, engineers, 
construction workers to work and build refineries that produce the 
specialized types and grades of fuel used by each branch of the service 
for their equipment. The refineries will be located on existing or 
former bases under the purview of the Department of Defense, and will 
represent the first refineries built in the United States since 1976. 
And the time to do it is now.

The Air Force isn't going to have a fleet of plug-in hybrid fighter 
jets, and the Navy isn't going to have a solar battleship in the near 
future. They need fuel, plain and simple.

Investing in critical infrastructure and protecting the Nation are 
our top responsibilities in the Federal Government. Today I am offering 
an amendment that provides Federal funds for the construction and 
design of one refinery for each branch of the military to produce the 
petroleum products required by that branch, combining these two 
critical roles for the public good.

Prices are high. So is demand. Let's address both sides of the energy 
equation, and let's put our Americans back to work to help the military 
protect the Nation.

We have heard a lot about exploring and drilling for American sources 
of energy. Hands down, Americans agree on this point. It is an 80 
percent issue across the country and, indeed, it is even higher in my 
district and other districts of north and central Texas. Polls show the 
vast majority of Americans favor drilling offshore in the ANWR.

The United States Department of Defense is straining under record 
high prices. In 2007, with operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the 
United States armed service consumed 16 gallons of fuel per soldier per 
day, or about $3 million worth of fuel every day. That is a lot of 
fuel, and that is a lot of opportunity for American energy and American 
jobs.

But this is not regular gasoline. All military planes, vehicles, 
generators and heavy equipment in areas of foreign operation use jet 
petroleum to avoid transporting and carrying different fuel grades and 
accidentally putting the wrong type of fuel in their equipment.

Right now global refineries are operating at a very tight capacity. 
This, in turn, limits the quantity of gasoline and other products that 
they can produce. This squeeze impacts the consumers, domestic refiners 
and the military as the cost of refining comprises between 10 and 20 
percent of the price at the pump. It means the taxpayers are getting 
hit with higher costs twice, and it also leaves military fuel supplies 
vulnerable to disruptions from terrorist attacks and natural disasters.

And then there's the question of importing refined products. We 
already heard under the colloquy about how important it is to use an 
American product, American-made steel. Well, how about we use American-
made gasoline? Use the gasoline that is produced here in America.

Domestic refinery production has declined as industry operates with 
tight profit margins and lower inventories of crude oil to cut gasoline 
costs, and these constraints mean a greater proportion of gasoline 
demand has to be met with imported products. We know what that means. 
We buy it from people who don't like us. We are funding both sides in 
the war on terror.

Four of five of the top suppliers of military fuel are foreign 
companies or foreign state-owned entities. This poses a serious threat 
to our national and our economic security and must be addressed.

Let me stress that this is a win/win for America. These military 
specific refineries could produce and protect specialized military 
fuels from capacity limitations that squeeze supply and increase prices 
for everyone; would free up commercial refining capacity and ensure 
that we are not forced to outsource a significant portion of our 
defense when we buy from foreign refineries.

Military commanders say you can't kick behind without tanker gas, or 
something like that. The Air Force isn't going to have a fleet of plug-
in hybrids, as I already said. Our national defense and our national 
economic security are too important to risk on shortages of refinery 
capacities when we are faced with natural disasters.

We have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. What good is it if there is no 
strategic way to refine it?

And this amendment would provide the beginning of that strategic way 
to put the refineries in areas that are already cleared 
environmentally, already have the security in place, and it makes 
sense.

We have also heard tonight that we need to pass a clean bill. It is 
important to get this bill done because our veterans and our military 
need the monies that will be appropriated in this bill, and I agree 
with that very much. It is my understanding this bill has been ready to 
go for 4 or 5 weeks.

I don't know why we have not seen fit to bring it up before tonight. 
I don't know why we had to bring it up under a modified closed rule. 
But those are the rules the majority has set. Those are the rules under 
which we will play.

So I thank the chairman for hearing this amendment. I think it is an 
important concept that needs to be furthered.

I yield back the balance of my time.
