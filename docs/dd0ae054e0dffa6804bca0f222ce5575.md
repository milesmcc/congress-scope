 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I join the citizens of New 
Mexico and the United States in celebrating the 100th anniversary of 
the United States Army Reserve. In 1916 Congress passed the National 
Defense Act, creating the Officers' Reserve Corps, later named the 
Organized Reserve Corps, all of which are forerunners of the current 
Army Reserve.

The Army Reserve has been an integral part of numerous conflicts. In 
both World Wars, Army Reserve soldiers answered the call of duty. In 
World War I, 89,500 reserve officers were mobilized and during World 
War II, 200,000 members of the Organized Reserve Corps served, with 
reserve officers providing 29 percent of the Army's officers. More than 
70 Army Reserve units were deployed to the Korean Peninsula providing 
combat support and combat service. Army Reserve members have also 
participated in Operation Desert Shield/Storm, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, 
Kosovo, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The Army Reserve mission has changed over time. Today, the Army 
Reserve has partnered with FEMA, State, and local agencies in defending 
the American homeland against terrorist attacks, providing resources 
and training to ''first responder'' organizations across the Nation.

New Mexico started deploying Army Reserve soldiers after September 
11, 2001; in fact, as early as December 2001, in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom, OEF. New Mexico Army Reserve soldiers are currently 
deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF. Over 50 percent of New 
Mexico's Army Reserve force have deployed in support of both campaigns.

Once again I would like to congratulate the Army Reserve on their 
centennial. I wish them continued success as they help protect our 
Nation.
