`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 23 July 2009`

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will read from the letter. It is three paragraphs:




 The Department of Defense supports striking from 


 legislation any provision that would require the development 


 or procurement of an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 


 Joint Strike Fighter.



 The current engine is performing well with more than 11,000 


 test hours. In addition, the risks associated with a single 


 engine provider are manageable as evidenced by the 


 performance of the F-22 and F/A-18/F, both Air Force and Navy 


 programs supplied by a single engine provider. The Air Force 


 currently has several fleets that operate on a single engine 


 source.


I draw back from the letter. What is unusual is to have a second 
engine. Logically, if we want to buy a car, it would be nice to have a 
second engine in the garage but would we pay the extra money for it if 
we had a perfectly good engine in the car? Back to the letter:




 Thus, further expenditures on a second engine are 


 unnecessary and will likely impede the progress of the 


 overall F-35 program.



 It is my belief that the JSF program presented in the 


 President's budget request is in the best interests of 


 national security. If a final bill is presented to the 


 President containing provisions that would seriously disrupt 


 the F-35 program, the President's senior advisors will 


 recommend that the President veto the bill.


I intend to show in my argument this morning that, in fact, this 
Armed Services Committee bill--if the amendment Senator McCain and I 
are proposing is not adopted--will seriously disrupt the F-35 program, 
the Joint Strike Fighter program and, therefore, will be occasion for 
the President's advisers to recommend he veto this entire and 
critically necessary bill.

I thank Secretary Gates for expressing support for the amendment 
Senator McCain and I and others--Senator Schumer, Senator Dodd, Senator 
Kyl--have offered to strip this unnecessary expenditure of money from 
the bill.

Our amendment, as I have said, would restore funding that was taken 
from the U.S. Marine Corps helicopter, the Huey, when the committee 
voted to fund the alternate engine. The vote to cut 10 Marine Corps 
helicopters comes at a time the Marines are conducting a major 
offensive in the mountains of Afghanistan where the high altitudes and 
hot weather require the best capabilities Congress can provide them, 
including these Hueys.

In fact, in recent statements from the Joint Staff and Marine Corps 
leadership, it is clear how urgently the Marines need the enhanced 
capabilities of the UH-1 Huey on the battlefield. Speaking before the 
Armed Services Committee of the Senate on Thursday, July 9, the Vice 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Cartwright, said to the members 
of the committee:




 Those helicopters are, in fact, critical.


He continued:




 The helicopter for the Marines is one of their most lethal 


 weapons. They are the most effective in the battlefield, 


 particularly in the counterinsurgency arena.


They are effective in built-up urban areas and in compounds because 
they can be discreet, so the value of those helicopters is significant.

The day after General Cartwright appeared, I received a letter from 
the Commandant of the Marine Corps, GEN James Conway.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the 
Record the letter from General Conway.
