Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I ask my fellow colleagues 
to join me in congratulating the 2009-2010 Congressional Youth Advisory 
Council. This year 45 students from public, private, and home schools 
in grades 9 through 12 made their voices heard and made a difference in 
their communities, their country and their Congress. These students 
volunteered their time, effort, and talent to inform me about the 
important issues facing their generation. As young leaders within their 
communities and their schools, these students boldly represent the 
promise and the hope we all have for their very bright future.

President Ronald Reagan said, ''Freedom is never more than one 
generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in 
the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for 
them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling 
our children and our children's children what it was once like in the 
United States where men were free.''

To ensure that the blessing of freedom is passed from one generation 
to the next, the members of the CYAC spent time interviewing a veteran 
and documenting the experience for the ''Preserving History Project.'' 
Today I'm proud to submit the brief summaries provided so the patriotic 
service of our dedicated veterans and the thoughtful work of the CYAC 
may be preserved for antiquity in the Congressional Record. A copy of 
each submitted student summary follows.

To each member of the Congressional Youth Advisory Council, thank you 
for making this year and this group a success. It is not a coincidence 
that this congressional tribute celebrates two generations of service. 
Each of you is trusted with the precious gift of freedom.

You are the voices of the future and I salute you. God bless you and 
God bless America.

The summary follows:




 I had the honor to sit down with Sergeant Goins, a member 


 of the United States Army, in his Plano West classroom to 


 learn about his intriguing assignments overseas. Chad Goins 


 is currently a teacher at Plano West Senior High School where 


 he instructs students in Introduction to Criminal Justice and 


 Criminal Investigation classes. Just under two years ago, in 


 June 2008, Sgt. Goins left to endure an eight month training 


 followed by ten months at Bagram Airfield in If Afghanistan. 


 His many awards and achievements clearly demonstrate the 


 integrity and valor with which he has served his country, 


 such as the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and the Combat Action 


 Badge. Due to the nature of Sgt. Goins' duties of Military 


 Intelligence, he was unable to discuss many of the specifics. 


 However, because he saw a lot of the local population, he 


 discussed with me just why the war in Afghanistan is so 


 difficult to fight. From this experience, I am now better 


 able to understand the war in Afghanistan and the reason to 


 why it is such a non-traditional war. The religious and 


 cultural differences and the thousands of familial tribes in 


 Afghanistan make continuity nearly impossible with Americans 


 to Afghans, and even Afghans to Afghans. Thank you, Sergeant 


 Goins and all other members of the U.S. Military for 


 everything you do to protect our country. For it is because 


 of you that we can live the life we do. I am thankful to add, 


 Sergeant Goins' duty ended on Thanksgiving Day of 2009, and 


 he returned home shortly after, injury free.--Laura Schuller.
