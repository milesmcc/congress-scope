`Mr. DURBIN â€” 11 December 2007`

Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object--and I will object to this 
request--let me say at the outset that what the Senator has asked for 
is to return to a bill which was considered by the Senate on November 
16, 2007. There was a failure of a cloture vote, which is a vote 
requiring 60 Senators to vote affirmatively before the bill goes 
forward. The final vote was 45 to 53. In fact, three Republican 
colleagues of the Senator from Texas joined in opposing that cloture 
vote. This is a Senate appropriations bill. As the Senator from Texas 
knows, the Constitution requires that spending bills originate in the 
House. So the House would either object or ignore this bill or blue 
slip the bill in a way that would mean that whatever we would do here 
would not achieve the result asked for by the Senator from Texas.

As of today, we have lost 3,888 American lives in Iraq. The amount of 
money which we have provided, according to the administration, would 
allow them to continue the war at least to the end of March and perhaps 
beyond. So the troops are not without the resources they need. What the 
Senator from Texas has proposed is an approach which is on its face 
unconstitutional and has been rejected by the Senate on November 16, 
including three Republican Senators. For that reason, I object.
