Mr. ARCURI. Just a point that I'd like to make on something that you 
said earlier, if you could comment on that.

We talk about money costs, but think of the amount of money that this 
Congress has had to appropriate for veterans benefits as a result of 
the staggering injuries, the staggering effects that this war has had 
on our veterans and on our military personnel, and I just think that 
that's something that I don't think that this administration thought 
about when they planned out Iraq. They didn't think about the number of 
wounded because, while our medical teams get better and better, we save 
many more lives, but obviously many, many more people receive injuries 
that they will suffer from the rest of their lives. And it's our duty 
and our responsibility as a Nation to take care


of those individuals, and the emotional costs to their family and 
obviously financial cost to this country of taking care of them is 
great.

And I just wanted to add that because that's something else that I 
don't think anyone thought about before we went into Iraq.
