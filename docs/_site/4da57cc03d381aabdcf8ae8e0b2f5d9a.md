Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to U.S. Army 
SGT Jose Regalado who died while serving our country.

SGT Jose Regalado was from El Sereno, California. He was born on May 
11, 1985, and attended Sierra Park Elementary School, El Sereno Middle 
School, and Woodrow Wilson High School. As a high school student, 
Sergeant Regalado joined the Junior ROTC where he worked hard to move 
up the JROTC ranks. He earned the position of cadet battalion command 
sergeant major, the highest noncommissioned officer position in the 
battalion, and received several of the highest awards possible.

Sergeant Regalado enlisted in the United States Army on July 22, 
2003. He was a member of K Troop, 3rd Squadron, 3rd Armored Calvary 
Regiment from Fort Hood, Texas.

On May 3, 2007 Sergeant Regalado married Sharri J. Ford, and on 
August 6, 2008, they were blessed with the birth of their daughter, 
Jaime. Sergeant Regalado was allowed to return to the United States for 
18 days to meet his daughter; it would be the first and last time he 
would spend time with her. Sergeant Regalado lost his life on November 
12, 2008, in Mosul, Iraq, as the result of injuries sustained from 
small arms fire.

As a young man, Sergeant Regalado enriched the lives of his 
surrounding El Sereno community. His JROTC instructors recall his 
competitive spirit and noted that while he was very demanding of his 
cadets, he was well liked and respected. He was a devoted father, even 
carrying the ultrasound of his unborn daughter in his pocket while in 
Iraq. He was a loving husband and the proud son of Jose and Raquel 
Regalado.

Sergeant Regalado served this country with courage, pride and 
loyalty. He gave the ultimate sacrifice to our country and for that we 
will be forever grateful to him and his family. My prayers and deepest 
sympathy go out to his wife and young daughter, family and friends.
