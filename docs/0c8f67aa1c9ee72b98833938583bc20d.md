`Mr. NEUGEBAUER â€” 23 May 2007`

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. And the gentleman's correct. In fact, the money that 
was taken out to fund the studying of global warming and intelligence 
was taken out of some of our more crucial intelligence areas, the 
intelligence that's used to help our young men and women in the 
battlefield know where the bad guys are before the bad guys know where 
they are. So that just doesn't make sense.

We're joined by some additional colleagues this evening, and 
certainly my good friend from Georgia, Congressman Gingrey, he's 
another Member that's been to Iraq three times. That seems to be the 
theme tonight. And I'm pleased to yield to the gentleman from Georgia.
