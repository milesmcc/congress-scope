Mr. SMITH of Washington. I rise in support of the National Defense 
Authorization Act and to discuss briefly the portions of the bill 
contained under the subcommittee that I chair on Terrorism and 
Unconventional Threats and Capabilities. And I want to begin by 
thanking Ranking Member Miller from the great State of Florida for his 
support for this bill. We work in true bipartisan fashion on the 
subcommittee, following the lead of our able chairman, who does the 
same with the full committee, and I think, in large part as a result of 
that, we produce a very good product.

I also want to thank the chairman for his overall leadership on the 
committee in putting together this mark. It places the priorities 
exactly where they belong, first and foremost, on our troops and their 
families, giving them the support they need to continue to fight and 
defend our country.

In program after program, you can see the priority that that is put 
in this bill. I really appreciate the chairman's work on that and, 
particularly, the 3.4 percent pay raise across the board for our 
military.

The bill also prioritizes our fight in Afghanistan, the central front 
now in the war against al Qaeda. It is absolutely clear that the battle 
over there has a profound impact on the national security of this 
country. This bill gives our troops over there the resources and 
equipment they need to fight the fight, to defeat al Qaeda, and to 
protect us against the violent extremists in that region.

In particular, it also recognizes the battle in Pakistan by funding 
counterinsurgency efforts there that are so critical not just to 
success in Pakistan but to success in Afghanistan as well.

On the subcommittee portion of our mark on the Terrorism 
Subcommittee, we are focused on three main issues: First of all, 
support for counterterrorism efforts, the fight against al Qaeda, and 
broader counterinsurgency and counterterrorism efforts across the 
globe; second, the support for innovative new technologies to give our 
troops the updated equipment that they need to best fight those fights; 
and lastly, to protect our homeland against unconventional threats.

All of these areas are focused on irregular warfare, unconventional 
threats, and the emerging threats that we face. And I want to take just 
a moment to thank Secretary Gates for his leadership in funding the 
money necessary, the programs necessary, the troops necessary to fight 
these fights. He made some bold steps in this bill to move us past a 
cold war mentality to focus on the threats that are right there before 
us from al Qaeda and other violent extremist groups. I think that makes 
an enormous difference.

In particular, in our mark we do everything we can to support our 
troops with the special operations command. They are the tip of the 
spear in fighting terrorism, in fighting insurgencies throughout the 
globe. We are growing their force--in the process of growing their 
force. It is necessary to fund that growth and fully support their 
outstanding efforts in protecting us across the globe.

We are very pleased with the operations and always make a high 
priority funding their efforts. We fully fund all of their unfunded 
requirements in this mark.

So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I simply again want to compliment 
Chairman Skelton, Ranking Member McKeon, also Ranking Member McHugh for 
all of his work on this committee and on this bill and Ranking Member 
Miller for his support as well. I think we have put together an 
outstanding bill that will best protect the national security interests 
of this country.
