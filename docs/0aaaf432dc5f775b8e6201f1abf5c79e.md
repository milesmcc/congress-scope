Mr. DREIER. And let me just briefly say that that amendment says that


when the President of the United States reports to the Congress that on 
the success in training or lack of success in training the Iraqi 
security forces, that that report not be made available to the 
leadership of al Qaeda by way of the Internet.

The amendment that I am going to offer when we defeat the previous 
question, Mr. Speaker, is an amendment that will allow us to say that 
we will strike the provision that says that the report from the 
President to the Congress is provided on the Internet for the world to 
see. We should not be feeding our enemies, those who want to kill us, 
with this kind of information.

And so, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to urge defeat of the previous 
question, and when we defeat that, I urge support of my quest to make 
the amendment in order that will allow us to prevent the President's 
report from getting on to the Internet for our enemy to see, and if by 
chance I am not successful, I urge defeat of the rule.
