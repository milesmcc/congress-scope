Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I was home last week, and although there 
was a great deal of discussion about gas prices, still the number one 
issue among the people of my district in Missouri is the military 
action in Iraq. And one of the things they are confused about is the 
fact that this is the most unpopular war in the history of our Republic 
and yet nothing seems to change. Over 70 percent of the American public 
is against the war, and we continue to travel down the same road over 
and over again.

One of the reasons I believe we have two ears and just one mouth is 
that we are to listen more than we speak. Therefore, it seems to me 
that the people of this country are speaking but we are simply not 
listening.

It is my hope that all blank checks and rubber stamps will be put 
away. And while we are waiting to discuss this, the Democrats are 
moving forward with our commitment to make serious changes in Iraq.
