Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I'll bet Osama bin Laden and 
his buddies are high-fiving each other in their caves after hearing 
that the administration is soft-pedaling on its promise for an 
aggressive fight in Afghanistan.

In March, the President unveiled a new plan for success for 
Afghanistan and Pakistan. Sadly, now he's singing a different tune at 
just the wrong time. General McChrystal recently warned that America 
and our allies are in danger of losing the war if we do not create a 
bold, new strategy for America that requires more troops.

The President should heed the general's advice and should stand 
strong for freedom and security by giving our troops the tools they 
want, need, and deserve for victory so they can return home with honor.

To quote the President: The world cannot afford the price that will 
come


due if Afghanistan slides back into chaos.
