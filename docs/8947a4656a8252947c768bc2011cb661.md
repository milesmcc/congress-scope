Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, last week, I introduced the Combat 
Troops Tax Relief Act. From Fort Huachuca in Arizona to Iraq and 
Afghanistan, members of our armed services make the defense of our 
great Nation their number one priority. With unflinching honor and 
dedication, our military families inspire us by sending their husbands 
and their wives and their sons and daughters off to war to protect our 
freedoms.

My bill calls on Congress to honor their patriotism and commitment to 
the military families with more than rhetoric. This bill would give 
them concrete tax relief. This Congress is setting new priorities, 
including policies impacting military families. This bill does more by 
cutting taxes for middle-class military families. It increases the 
standard tax deduction for our soldiers and protects military families' 
eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Tax 
Credit.

Military families in southern Arizona and across the country deserve 
nothing less.
