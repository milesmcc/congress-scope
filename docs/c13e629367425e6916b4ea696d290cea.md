# RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT
## `c13e629367425e6916b4ea696d290cea`
`Mr. SAXTON â€” 12 July 2007`

---


Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise with great respect for the chairman of the Armed 
Services Committee and the author of this bill, but with strong 
opposition to H.R. 2956.

Mr. Speaker, the short title of this bill is the ''Responsible 
Redeployment from Iraq Act.'' But, Mr. Speaker, this bill is not 
responsible. It is irresponsible. This bill is an irresponsible 
political act that will put our troops in danger and will result in 
catastrophic consequences for the United States, for the Iraqi people, 
for Israel, for the greater Middle Eastern region, and for the rest of 
the world.

As The Washington Post said in this morning's paper, this bill is 
being considered today for ''reasons having more to do with American 
politics than with Iraqi reality.''

We must oppose this bill for numerous reasons, but let me mention 
just three. First, this bill fails to highlight the consequences of 
reducing our force levels too early. Such consequences would have a 
devastating effect on Iraq, would embolden al Qaeda in Iran, and would 
have severe security impacts on Israel and throughout the Middle East.

Al Qaeda and its proxies are engaged in a jihad against the United 
States and against the West. Al Qaeda's second in command, al Zawahiri, 
reaffirmed in a July 4 speech an al Qaeda plan to use Iraq, Afghanistan 
and Somalia for jihadi planning and training against us.

Second, instead of putting forward legislation that offers an 
alternative to the plan being implemented by General Petraeus and 
Ambassador Crocker, this political ploy calls for a vague ''troop 
reduction'' to be a ''limited presence'' in a ''safe and orderly 
manner'' within 120 days; but it fails to define any of these terms.

Specifically, this bill does not define what ''limited presence'' 
means. Does it mean 50,000 troops or 100,000 troops or 137,000 troops? 
What is a limited presence? No one knows. This is not a serious bill; 
it is a political bill.

Third, the bill requires the President to address whether it is 
necessary for our Armed Forces to carry out missions such as, listen to 
this, protecting diplomatic facilities and U.S. citizens, whether it is 
necessary to carry out acts like acting to disrupt or eliminate al 
Qaeda, or if it is necessary to carry out acts including training and 
equipping members of Iraqi security forces. Let me ask my friends on 
the other side of the aisle, for goodness sake, what else would we do 
there?

It is illogical to ask whether these missions are necessary and only 
proves once again that this bill is a political tool and not an 
alternative plan.

There are also two other points that my colleagues should consider. 
First, the situation in Iraq is not conducive to a force reduction. As 
an example of why this is true, the British have indicated their intent 
to draw down and have pulled back to the Basra airport. And as a 
result, Basra is now in the center of a power struggle between Shiite 
elements and tribal leaders over control of oil and political power. 
Local governance control has fractured along militia lines because of a 
British redeployment like the ones we are talking about in this bill.

Second, we need to remind ourselves of what happened in Beirut and 
Afghanistan when forces precipitously withdrew there. In October 1983, 
our Marine barracks in Beirut was bombed by Hezbollah with support from 
Iran. We withdrew our Marines in February 1984, and by that April, the 
remainder of the peacekeeping force had followed. That civil war 
continued until 1990 and Hezbollah emerged as a much stronger force, 
which to this day threatens the West. We should ask ourselves: Could 
the U.S. have prevented the rise of Hezbollah and the influence of 
Tehran


had we not had a precipitous withdrawal like the one provided for in 
this bill?

Second, in the 1980s, the Afghan resistance built momentum by 
recruiting Muslim fighters to wage jihad against the Soviets. The 
Soviet withdrawal of 1989 was followed by a civil war and the collapse 
of the government. The Taliban rose in 1993 and gained control of 
Afghanistan.

In 1996, bin-Laden moved to Afghanistan where he forged an alliance 
between al-Qaeda and the Taliban. What followed were al-Qaeda attacks 
on the WorId Trade Center, Khobar Towers, the embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania, the USS Cole, and then September 11th. My colleagues, ask 
yourself this: ''Could the U.S. have prevented the rise of al-Qaeda by 
responding to these threats?''

I want to urge my colleagues to keep in mind that the world is 
watching how the United States handles this tough challenge in Iraq. If 
we concede defeat and retreat, we will send a strong message of 
weakness and inability to remain committed to our allies and to our 
enemies.

Tom Friedman noted in the New York Times this week that our 
withdrawal will mean ''more ethnic, religious and tribal killings 
across Iraq,'' adding, ''it will be one of the most morally ugly scenes 
you can imagine, no less than Darfur.'' The Post today also stated that 
a withdrawal will result in a ''full-blown civil war, conflicts 
spreading beyond Iraq's borders, or genocide.'' Picture the Iraqis who 
have helped us, picture them watch as we prepare to leave and picture 
them clinging to our vehicles in fear of their very lives as we start 
down the road from Baghdad.

I believe this reckless abandonment of the mission in Iraq would send 
a clear message to the Iraqi people, our allies, and potential partners 
around the world that Americans are weak and cannot be trusted. In this 
world of transnational terrorism and proliferation we can not afford to 
stand alone.

It is critical that we give General Petraeus the months we gave him 
to implement his strategy, and I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this dangerous bill. In this case national security should trump 
national politics.
