Mr. REYES. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
couldn't agree more with his comments on how serious this authorization 
is and our duty to do what we have been sent here to do, especially 
today for our military.

So with that, Madam Chair, I rise to express strong support for H.R. 
1585. And I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), 
our chairman, and the ranking member, Mr. Hunter, for the great job 
that they have done on crafting together a piece of legislation that is 
so vital and important.

Having said that, Madam Chair, in July of 2008, the Army will conduct 
a limited user test with soldiers from the Army Evaluation Task Force 
based at Fort Bliss using the first spinout of the FCS technologies. I 
know that the gentleman from Missouri understands how critical the 
first spinout of FCS technologies is for our Nation's warfighters, our 
warfighters that are currently at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

So I would now like to yield to the chairman of the Armed Services 
Committee in the hope of entering into a colloquy so that he can 
discuss how the bill addresses this very important and vital issue.

I yield to the chairman.
