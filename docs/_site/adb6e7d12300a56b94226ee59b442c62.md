Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, last year I was in Afghanistan. Some 
paratroopers were transporting me outside the city of Kandahar, and one 
of them stopped and turned to me and said, Are you a Congressman? I 
said yes. He said, Can you help us? We haven't had a pay raise in 10 
years. I said, Can I help you? You bet I can.

Upon returning, I introduced the COMBAT Act to increase specialty pay 
for troops serving overseas and separated from their families. Over the 
past several months, I have worked to incorporate hostile fire, 
imminent danger, and family separation allowance pay increases into the 
2011 National Defense Authorization Act. This increase will help 
hundreds of thousands of servicemembers and their families.

Our servicemembers and their families have made enormous sacrifices 
to keep us safe. They deserve this pay raise, and I am proud to see 
that the increases are included in the 2011 defense authorization bill.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your efforts, and for working with me on 
this issue, and for all the work that you have done for our Armed 
Forces. I support this important legislation.
