# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `d1db0e2c0afd13b3dc4e03170cfc2edb`
`Mr. GONZALEZ â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to establish a ground rule 
for all my colleagues, and that is, regardless of how you vote on this 
resolution, no one will question your patriotism. If we can just start 
with that benchmark, I think we will have a higher degree of debate and 
in good faith.

Mr. Speaker, this resolution is about duty and responsibility, the 
duty and responsibility that Congress owes to our men and women in 
uniform. Our first duty is to make wise and educated choices in 
identifying a threat, the necessity of action and the legitimacy of the 
goal before committing or continuing to commit more of our troops to 
the war.

When considering this resolution, which reflects that an escalation 
of the war is unwarranted and is not in the best interests of our 
Nation and our troops, each of us must ask one fundamental question: Is 
escalating and continuing the war in Iraq worth fighting and dying for? 
Because that, in the final analysis, is what we decide. We seek an 
answer to this question, but we must be ever mindful that the courage 
and bravery of our troops is never questioned. Our soldiers' valor and 
commitment are not diminished by the errors in judgment made by their 
civilian leaders. The question is whether the mission in Iraq is worth 
their sacrifice. As we move forward with this decision, we must 
recognize the lessons of history, or we are doomed to repeat its grave 
mistakes.



For example, ''The public has been led into a trap from which it will 
be hard to escape with dignity and honor. They have been tricked into 
it by a steady withholding of information. The Baghdad communiques are 
belated, insincere, and incomplete. Things have been far worse than we 
have been told, our administration more bloody and inefficient than any 
that public knows. We are, today, not far from a disaster.''

Now, the parallels are uncanny, and you are wondering who may have 
said that. The quote was 86 years ago, and it was a communication from 
T.E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, in August of 1920, 
from Baghdad.

Continuing. ''The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. In 
addition, there is significant underreporting of violence in Iraq. The 
standard for recording attacks acts as a filter to keep events out of 
reports and databases.'' More Lawrence of Arabia? More 1920? No. 2006, 
the Iraq Study Group report.

Let me continue. 1992, General Colin Powell. ''The Gulf War was a 
limited objective war. If it had not been, we would be ruling Baghdad 
today, at unpardonable expense in terms of money, lives lost, and 
regional relationships.''

Now, a year earlier there was an observation, ''Once you got Baghdad, 
it's not clear what you do with it. It's not clear what kind of 
government you would put in place of the one that is there now, Saddam 
Hussein. Is it going to be a Shia regime, a Sunni regime, or a Kurdish 
regime? Or one that tilts towards the Baathists, or one that tilts 
towards the Islamic fundamentalists? How much credibility is that 
government going to have if it is set up by the United States military 
when it is there? How long does the United States military have to stay 
to protect the people that sign on for that government? And what 
happens to it once you leave?'' That was 1991, spoken by then-Secretary 
of Defense and current Vice President of the United States, Dick 
Cheney.

We remain a good and great Nation, but we have done all the good in 
Iraq that we are going to do. An escalation only delays the day that 
the Iraqis assume the responsibility of setting aside their sectarian 
differences and embrace the promise of democracy that we have delivered 
to them. We cannot do this for them, whether we send in 20,000 or 
200,000 more troops. And we cannot ignore the lessons of history, the 
views of military experts and the will of the American people.

It is time for our troops to start coming home. And it is time for 
the Iraqis to start building a home. Vote ''yes'' on this resolution.
