Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, due to being unavoidably delayed, I 
missed a vote on H.R. 1591, U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, 
Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007--
Passage, Objections of the President Not Withstanding (rollcall No. 
276). I would have voted ''nay'' had I been present to record my vote.
