`Mr. REID â€” 5 June 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, my counterpart, the distinguished Senator 
from Kentucky, said this is a 2-week bill, and we are in the second 
week of this bill.

I will also state--and I am not as much of a poll watcher as my 
caucus would tell me I should be--that the polls also show the 
Republican Members of Congress are not as well thought of as Democratic 
Members of Congress.

As far as success, I think we have done pretty well this past 6 
months. We now have a bill that has been signed by the President where, 
for the first time in 10 years, we give a raise to the people who need 
it worst, the people who rely on the minimum wage. Keep in mind that 60 
percent of those who draw a minimum wage are women. For the vast 
majority of those women, that is the only money they have for 
themselves and their families.

We have tried for 3 years to get disaster assistance for farmers, and 
we were able to get that. That is now signed into law. The President 
has made many trips to the gulf, but in this supplemental bill, which 
we forced the President to sign, we now have monetary relief for people 
in the gulf affected by Katrina.

We were able to extend the SCHIP program for children's health care. 
That is a significant accomplishment. That will take care of things 
until October. We were also--in the legislation that the President 
signed, that we forced--able to get more than he gave us in the 
supplemental appropriations bill. We had more money for the troops in 
Iraq and Afghanistan--$4 billion more for medicine and veterans' 
benefits.

We have been trying for years to get money for homeland security. In 
this bill, we got it, a billion dollars for homeland security that has 
long been necessary.

Within the next week or two, we are going to have a conference report 
that will come forward, sending to the President legislation on stem 
cell research that will give hope to millions.

I worked, in fact, as late as yesterday with the distinguished 
Republican leader, and I think we are in a position where we can come 
up with a satisfactory conference report on ethics and lobbying reform.

So I think we should not be denigrating the work of this Congress and 
the things we have been able to accomplish, which has been done on a 
bipartisan basis. We have had to push and pull a little, getting 
motions to proceed on various pieces of legislation that were 
necessary, but we were able to do that. So I don't think it is time to 
denigrate or belittle the Congress based on the polls we have seen.

I repeat, let us not get into poll watching, because if you look at 
the polls, Democratic Congressmen, Democrats generally, are scored much 
higher than Republicans. But I repeat, I don't follow polls. I think we 
should be doing a lot more by what we feel is right to do than what 
polls show.

I hope the immigration matter can move along. I think the two leaders 
of the Senate have stated how we feel about this, and now we turn it 
over to the good hands of our experienced managers.
