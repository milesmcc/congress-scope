Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, as we stand here today, 
the Iraqi people enjoy a freedom and sense of self-government they were 
not afforded 4 years ago. Since the United States originally liberated 
the Iraqis, they have established a democracy, ratified a constitution, 
and elected a representative government. Such rights were denied under 
the totalitarian regime of Saddam Hussein.

General David Petraeus, the new commander of coalition forces in 
Iraq, is an expert in fighting insurgencies by murderers who defy laws 
of war. Our military officials have made necessary adjustments, and we 
are seeing signs of progress. Cutting funding, limiting reinforcements 
and setting artificial timetables only serve to undermine this end. 
Together, as Democrats and Republicans, we must achieve victory in Iraq 
to achieve victory in the global war on terrorism to protect American 
families. We must face the terrorists overseas, or we will face them 
again in the streets of America.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
