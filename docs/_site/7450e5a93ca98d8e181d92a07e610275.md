# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `7450e5a93ca98d8e181d92a07e610275`
`Mr. WATT â€” 14 February 2007`

---


Mr. WATT. Madam Speaker, in October of 2002 I worked meticulously 
with Members of the Congressional Black Caucus to craft a statement of 
principles that has proven to be so absolutely prophetic. Listen to 
what our 2002 principle said, and it will put in context why I feel so 
strongly that this war has taken us in the wrong direction and why this 
resolution is so necessary and worthy of our support.

First principle: ''We oppose a unilateral first strike action by the 
United States without a clearly demonstrated and imminent threat of 
attack on the United States.''

My colleagues, history will record that the President took first 
strike action, and that there was neither a clearly demonstrated nor an 
imminent threat of attack on the United States.

Second principle: ''Only Congress has the authority to declare war.''

History will record that Congress delegated that authority to the 
President, but I say unapologetically that history will also record 
that I voted against that delegation of authority. I never believed 
that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; and, even if it did, I never 
believed that they posed any imminent threat to the United States.

Third principle: ''Every conceivable diplomatic option must be 
exhausted.''

History will record that our President instead thumbed his nose at 
the United Nations and at almost all diplomatic options in his rush to 
lead us into this foolhardy war.

Fourth principle: ''A unilateral first strike would undermine the 
moral authority of the United States, destabilize the Middle East 
region, and undermine the ability of our Nation to address unmet 
domestic priorities.''

The passage of time has demonstrated and history will record that 
every single one of these concerns was legitimate and warranted.

Fifth principle: ''Any post-strike plan for maintaining stability in 
the region would be costly and require a long-term commitment.''

We haven't yet gotten to a level of stability that we are trying to 
maintain, but the cost of this war today exceeds $500 billion. That is 
costly and with no end in sight. If we continue to follow the 
President, the duration of our commitment has no end in sight and no 
plan to bring home or redeploy our troops.

Increasing the number of troops in Iraq does not make ending the war 
more foreseeable. Past troop increases in Iraq have paraded under 
different names than surge, but make no mistake about it, this is not 
the first time the United States will have increased troop levels, and 
each time they have been met with greater levels of violence.

From December of 2003 to April 2004, the troop increase paraded under 
the name ''troop rotation'' and resulted in an increase from 122,000 to 
137,000 troops; yet April of 2004 was the second deadliest month for 
U.S. forces.

From November 2004 to March 2005, the increase paraded under the name 
''improving counterinsurgency operations after the Fallujah 
offensive,'' or ''increasing security after January 2005.'' We 
increased our troop level to 150,000 troops; the result, no impact on 
violence increase. And again, September to December of 2005, we went to 
160,000 troops, still no decrease in violence.

In most respects, what the President has proposed is business as 
usual, simply under a different name. It did not work before, and there 
is no prospect that it will work this time. Madam Speaker, this 
resolution is one that we should support and bring our troops home.

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Resolution. Simply 
stated, as the Resolution says, I support the troops and I oppose the 
increase in the number of troops. Simply stated, I support a 
redeployment of the rest of our troops from Iraq as soon as possible.

But I can't go forward before I review how we got here in the first 
place. Looking back helps me to put a time perspective on this because 
this War is now approaching 5 years in duration, a period longer than 
the Second World War. And looking back also helps me to put a 
substantive perspective on this that I think is absolutely critical to 
an understanding of my vote.

It's gut wrenching for me to recall that as early as October 2002--
several months before the President proceeded to war in Iraq and long 
before I was later elected to serve the 2-year term that I have now 
completed as Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus--I worked 
meticulously with every single member of the Congressional Black Caucus 
to craft a Statement of Principles that have proven to be so absolutely 
prophetic. Listen to what our 2002 Principles said and it will put in 
context why I feel so strongly that this War has taken us in the wrong 
direction and why this Resolution is so necessary and worthy of 
support:

First 2002 Congressional Black Caucus Principle: ''We oppose a 
unilateral, first-strike action by the United States without a clearly 
demonstrated and imminent threat of attack on the United States.'' My 
colleagues, history will record that the President took first strike 
action and that there was neither a clearly demonstrated nor an 
imminent threat of attack on the United States.

Second Principle: ''Only Congress has the authority to declare war.'' 
History will record that Congress delegated that authority to the 
President, but I say unapologetically that history will also record 
that I voted against that delegation of authority. I never believed 
that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and--perhaps more 
importantly--even if they did, I never believed that they posed any 
imminent threat to the United States. Saddam Hussein was a dastardly 
tyrant and bully toward his own people, but was a coward and no threat 
to the United States.

Third Principle: ''Every conceivable diplomatic option must be 
exhausted.'' History will record that our President, instead, thumbed 
his nose at the United Nations and at almost all diplomatic options in 
his rush to lead us into this foolhardy war.

Fourth Principle: ''A unilateral first strike would undermine the 
moral authority of the United States, destabilize the Middle East 
region and undermine the ability of our Nation to address unmet 
domestic priorities.'' The passage of time has demonstrated and history 
will record that every single one of those concerns was legitimate and 
warranted.

Fifth Principle: ''Any post-strike plan for maintaining stability in 
the region would be costly and require a long-term commitment.'' We 
haven't yet gotten to a level of stability that we're trying to 
maintain, but the cost of this War to date exceeds $500 billion. That's 
''costly'' and with no end in sight. If we continue to follow the 
President, the duration of our commitment has no end in sight and no 
plan to bring home or redeploy our troops.

Increasing the number of troops in Iraq does not make ending the War 
more foreseeable. It will only escalate the number of troops and the 
prospects of casualties and will likely only increase the resolve of 
the enemy, the same thing that increases in troop levels have done in 
the past. Past troop increases in Iraq have paraded under different 
names than ''surge''. But, make no mistake about it, this is not the 
first time the United States will have increased troop levels. And each 
time they have been met with greater violence.

From December of 2003 to April of 2004, the troop increase paraded 
under the name ''troop rotation'' and resulted in an increase from 
122,000 to 137,000 troops. Yet April of 2004 was the second deadliest 
month for U.S. forces.

From November 2004 to March 2005, the increase paraded under the name 
''improving counterinsurgency operations after the Fallujah offensive'' 
or ''increasing security before the January 2005 constitutional 
elections'' and increased troops to 150,000. Result: short term 
positive impact, but longer term increase in violence and resistance.

Between September and December 2005, troop levels were increased 
again, taking the


number up to 160,000, around the constitutional referendum and 
parliamentary elections. The referendum and elections proceeded without 
major violence, but the increase had little long term impact on 
sectarian violence.

In most respects, what the President has proposed is business as 
usual, simply under a different name. It did not work before and there 
is little prospect that it will work this time.

Madam Speaker, this Resolution is our attempt to make it clear that 
we do not support a troop increase or an escalation of this War. I 
intend to vote for the Resolution. I just hope the President is 
listening.
