Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Corporal David 
McConnell of Altoona, Pennsylvania. CPL McConnell is currently serving 
in Iraq as part of the United States Marine Corps. He has served our 
country since 2005 when he first enlisted in the Marine Corps.

Corporal McConnell was deployed to Iraq on December 31, 2006, 
initially serving as an Infantryman. He was stationed in Fallujah as 
part of the Regimental Combat Team 6 Security Platoon, where he acted 
as convey security. Promoted to corporal in August, McConnell is 
currently stationed in Fallujah to provide protection services for the 
team directing leader engagement with Iraqi diplomats.

A dedicated and enthusiastic leader, Corporal McConnell is committed 
to furthering the cause he believes so much in. He is proud of the work 
of his unit and believes that the contributions and sacrifices they 
have made are well worth it to be able to assist in expanding freedom 
in Iraq.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank and recognize David and 
the rest of our troops for their efforts in serving our military. He 
and his unit should be very proud of the work they are doing in Iraq 
and the sacrifices they have made for their country. Their courage and 
devotion do not go unnoticed, and they are all in our thoughts and 
prayers for a safe return home.
