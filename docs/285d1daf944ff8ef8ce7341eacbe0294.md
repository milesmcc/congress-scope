Mr. LEE of New York. I rise today to honor a great man, Marine Lance 
Corporal Timothy G. Serwinowski. Just 21 years old, Lance Corporal 
Serwinowski was killed in action while serving in southern Afghanistan 
this past Sunday. A native of Tonawanda, New York, and a 2007 graduate 
of North Tonawanda High School, Tim enjoyed singing and playing the 
guitar. He played football throughout high school and was honored by 
his coaches during his senior year for his ''excellence and 
leadership,'' and he took those traits to the marines.

When asked why he wanted to enlist with the marines, he said, ''If 
you're going to do it, you go with the best.'' Tim strove to be the 
best, and his life was taken far too soon. Both Tim and his family--
some who I know personally--have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our 
country, and we owe it to them our renewed commitment to bring our men 
and women home as soon as possible. Tim served our Nation with valor 
and with honor, and he will be deeply missed by the many whose lives he 
has touched.
