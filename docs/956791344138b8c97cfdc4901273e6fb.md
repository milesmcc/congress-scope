Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1424, 
the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act.

In recent years, many brave Americans serving in the National Guard 
and Reserves returned home after fighting for our freedom in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. They return to their civilian jobs and are subject to 
their private health insurance. The all-too-common tale, however, is 
that our veterans have witnessed horrors that many cannot even imagine. 
One in six of these veterans will experience symptoms of post-traumatic 
stress disorder, or PTSD, that can impair them for many years beyond 
their homecoming.

Many of these veterans choose to seek treatment at their local VA 
hospital or clinic. But for some of our veterans in rural areas of our 
country, like mine, it is far easier to use their private insurance and 
seek treatment from their local private doctor. Unfortunately, some of 
these veterans quickly find that PTSD is not covered in their health 
insurance plan.

Our veterans shouldn't have to travel for hours simply to meet with a 
qualified mental health professional. H.R. 1424 fixes this injustice 
and ensures that our veterans have the choice to seek treatment for 
PTSD through their private insurance plan.
