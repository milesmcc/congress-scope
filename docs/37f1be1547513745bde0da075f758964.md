Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart 
that I pay tribute to Cpl Tyler Seth Trovillion, USMC. Corporal 
Trovillion, a 23-year-old resident of Richardson, Texas, answered his 
country's call and paid the ultimate price.

He belonged to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, Alpha Company, 
2nd Platoon of Camp Pendleton, California. He died on June 15, 2005, 
when his vehicle hit an improvised explosive device while conducting 
combat operations near Ar Ramadi, Iraq.

We Texans are so proud of the men and women we have serving in Iraq 
and appreciate their dedication to defending freedom and promoting 
democracy.

To his family, our prayers are with you, and we are grateful for 
Tyler's courage and service to the United States of America.

As President Ronald Reagan once said, ''Some people spend an entire 
lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world. But, the 
Marines don't have that problem.''

Tyler, God bless you and God bless America. Semper Fidelis.
