Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let's just step back. There is no question 
when you are talking about where do American people stand on the 
redeployment of the troops out of Iraq. None of these bills suggest to 
do it tomorrow or the week after. This is the responsible redeployment 
of troops out of Iraq. Do it in a planful way that maintains the safety 
of those troops as they leave, and tries to do our best to try to 
maintain a stable government that we leave behind. There is no question 
where the American people stand on that. That is not just you and me 
listening to people when we go back home; that is also every poll that 
we have seen of the American public over the last 2 years.

There is no question, Mr. Meek, where people stand on the GI bill. 
The numbers are off the charts when you ask folks if they think that 
this country should guarantee a college education to every returning 
warrior from Iraq and Afghanistan. There is no guesswork involved here.



Now, I don't know where the President gets his direction from on his 
veto threats. But for all of us that are sitting here deciding whether 
we vote for these things in the first place or override the President's 
veto when they come back, there is no research that has to be done in 
the public opinion. There are no guesses that have to be made. This is 
all just common sense, whether you are listening to it when you go back 
to the district or you are reading the public opinion polls, Mr. Meek.
