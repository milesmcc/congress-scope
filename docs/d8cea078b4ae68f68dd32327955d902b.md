`Mr. WAMP â€” 5 September 2007`

Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman from Missouri and his distinguished 
leadership as the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.

Let me say, before introducing the gentleman from Texas, one of the 
biggest changes that I see, not just in Iraq, but globally, is that 
finally moderate Muslims are standing up against the radicals. We're 
seeing that in country, we're seeing that in other parts of the world. 
Up until a few months ago when they saw American resolve coming 
forward, they literally were so afraid and intimidated and harassed, 
and the radicals were seizing the moment.

Now, finally, and let me tell you, because of the sheer numbers, if 
we're ever going to really permanently throw this threat back, the 
moderate people in Islam have to lead and help us, and that's beginning 
to happen.

A gentleman who's been to Iraq six times, Dr. Burgess from Texas, 
another physician, a healer, a member of the Commerce Committee with 
extraordinary perspective from six separate visits to Iraq in country. 
I yield him such time as he may consume, hoping to get the other 
gentleman from Texas in at some point in the next 7 minutes.
