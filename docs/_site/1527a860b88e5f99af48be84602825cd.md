Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, this week, the German Shepherd Lex, whose 
master Corporal Dustin Lee was killed in Iraq in 2007, is returning to 
Washington.

The RPG that killed his master also injured Lex by sending shrapnel 
into his back. Lex's pain has been very severe over the past three 
years and also has a hard time walking.

Lex was able to be retired and in December of 2007 he was officially 
adopted by Jerome and Rachel Lee, the parents of Cpl Dustin Lee.

I would like to thank Gen. Mike Regner for helping get Lex retired 
and adopted by the Lees, as their son would have wanted his partner to 
be home with this family.

This week Lex is traveling to DC for a visit to the Georgetown 
Veterinary Hospital. Dr. Lee Morgan is performing stem cell therapy on 
Lex to help relieve his pain and extend his life. The idea is to not 
only treat the pain, but to repair the damage done by the shrapnel 
altogether.

This is a very important procedure for both Lex and the Lee family, 
as they have all been through so much together already.

Many individuals and organizations have made it possible for Lex to 
receive this therapy by donating time and money to the cause,

I would like to thank the Humane Society, the American Kennel Club, 
the German Shepherd Dog Club of Northern Virginia, Shoreline German 
Shepherd Dog Club, and the U.S. War Dogs Association.

I would like to give a special thanks to Connie Whitfield and her 
husband Congressman Ed Whitfield, for all they have devoted to Lex and 
the Lee family. Thanks to John Burnam for all of his work and for 
bringing Lex's story to my attention three years ago.

A big thank you goes to Dr. Lee Morgan of Georgetown Veterinary 
Hospital for performing the procedure.

Contributions came from all over the country and I appreciate 
everyone who donated. A dog handler currently stationed in Afghanistan 
sent a donation, which speaks to the importance of these dogs and the 
appreciation our service members have for them.

With that Madam Speaker, I close by asking God to please bless our 
men and women in uniform, their families, and I ask God to please bless 
America.
