Mr. GOHMERT. I thank the gentlelady. You have made some great points.

During the 1990s, though, we were assured; we heard so many times all 
these lies about weapons of mass destruction. And maybe it is 
unfortunate that it turns out that all the times President Clinton 
assured us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, maybe they were 
right, maybe President Clinton was lying all those times that he said 
Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Maybe Madeline Albright was lying 
all those times she said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Maybe 
George Bush should not have believed all the information they provided 
to him about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction.

But, nonetheless, we are now hearing people even in some of the 
debates and whatnot blaming this President and saying, if we would just 
leave the jihadist extremists alone, they will leave us alone.

And they want to blame President Bush, the current President Bush for 
our Americans being killed. If you are going to do that, though, you 
have to blame President Clinton for 9/11 because all the time, he was 
President. Of course, they tried the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 
that failed, and then they began planning for the next, and that was 9/
11.

Now, I feel like President Clinton made a lot of mistakes, but to 
blame him for Muslims plotting during the entire time he was President 
to blow up and kill thousands of Americans doesn't fit, because during 
his Presidency this country, nearly every time President Clinton 
committed troops or military assets it was to protect Muslims around 
the world. And yet all that time the jihadist extremists were plotting 
to kill thousands of Americans. So this stuff about blaming President 
Bush doesn't wash.

You go back to 1979. I was at Fort Benning. The first jihadist 
attack, taking our American embassy, that is an act of war. You are 
attacking American property, that is an act of war. Taking hostages. We 
did nothing but wring our hands and beg them to let them go. That was a 
breakdown and that was a glitch right after we fled from Vietnam. It 
was not a good chapter.

But the fact is, there are people that want to destroy our way of 
life. And we took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. The 
President did. I know, having taken that oath as a member of the United 
States military before, that is all taken very seriously. And there are 
people that want to destroy our way of life. We owe it to them to 
provide them the common defense. And we see things being weakened here, 
and it breaks my heart.


The American people, any time you see a program cut, whether it is 
under President Carter, President Clinton, or now under the Democratic 
majority cutting some intelligence program, and then you find out that 
it goes to some pork barrel earmark to somebody in the majority, it 
just breaks your heart, I can tell you, having been in the military 
when those things happen. And so it is heartbreaking to see the way it 
looks like we are going to head down that path with this Democratic 
majority.

I would yield to my friend from Texas for further comment.
