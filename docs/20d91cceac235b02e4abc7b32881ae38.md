Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major Jon. M. 
Lauder and his dedicated service to this great Nation.

After graduating from the Virginia Military Institute with a degree 
in Civil Engineering in 1994, he has served on active duty with the 
United States Marine Corps. He proudly served two combat tours in Iraq, 
including the initial assault into Iraq in 2003 as part of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. After a combat tour in Eastern Afghanistan as a part of 
Operation Enduring Freedom, Major Lauder served as a U.S. military 
observer in Israel during the summer of 2006 during the Israeli-
Hezbollah war. He is currently the Commanding Officer for the Marcie 
Corps Recruiting Station in Dallas, Texas.

On May 14, 2010, Major Lauder will be turning over his command and 
will move to Washington, DC for his new assignment at the Pentagon. It 
has been my distinct honor and pleasure to work with him. I proudly 
call him my friend and know that Major Lauder's dedicated service has 
made our Nation a safer and better place.

Madam Speaker, I ask my esteemed colleagues to join me in expressing 
our heartfelt gratitude to Major Lauder. I wish him and his family all 
the best.
