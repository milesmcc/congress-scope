Mr. PASCRELL. Instead of using the same test, the military uses a 
simple questionnaire for postdeployment screenings--a written 
questionnaire.

These assessments are not comparable. They do not detect changes to a 
soldier's brain. Just like in sports, the key to pre- and postinjury 
assessment is to use the same tool. When you have a baseline, you are 
better able to compare.

As cochair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, I recognize 
the need to help both our military and civilian populations in 
addressing brain injury. My amendment, which is endorsed by the Iraq 
and Afghanistan Veterans of America, which has bipartisan support, 
ensures our troops are given the proper cognitive screenings today and 
in the future.

I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.
