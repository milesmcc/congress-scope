# NEW IRAQ STRATEGY
## `a0f4a98e97f73910671bb70f458c76c0`
`Mr. WARNER â€” 11 July 2007`

---


Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving in 
this body for 29 years. I have never met a finer gentleman than my 
colleague from Tennessee. I thank you for your gracious reference to 
this humble Senator.

I simply say that this has been a constructive debate. We have an 
honest difference of opinion. But I would urge that perhaps you check 
into some of the analysis that has been performed in certain segments 
of the Government about the current operations and how the benchmarks, 
so to speak--or maybe I withdraw those words--the points of strategy 
that are in the Iraq Study Group will or will not adopt.

I would simply say the obvious to my colleagues, that that report of 
the Iraq Study Group is still on the President's desk. I do not think 
he requires the need of the Senate to tell him what is in it. He knows. 
He looked at it, I have been given that assurance, very carefully 
before he devised his January 10 strategy.

The concern, the greatest concern I have is sort of sending out a 
signal we have throughout, that this strategy would be working better 
than this current strategy. I frankly felt that and expressed that on 
January 10. But I have to accept the fact that he is the Commander in 
Chief. He made the decision. He decided not, at this time, to implement 
the framework of the Baker-Hamilton report but to go ahead with the 
surge.

I am hesitant to criticize him now. I criticized pretty heavily, if 
you look at the Congressional Record, in January. I urged in several 
speeches that more of this Iraq Study Group concept be incorporated in 
the surge strategy. But having done that, I feel obligated now to 
support the President because he is committed to follow the law of the 
land as originated in this Chamber in a bill which I sponsored, and I 
believe my distinguished colleague from Tennessee did vote for. That 
bill, almost in its entirety, was incorporated into the appropriations 
bill by the conference of the House and the Senate, and it is the law 
of the land.

I hope the report that will be forthcoming in 48 hours reflects the 
seriousness of how the President approached the mandates of the 
Congress: Report to us on July 15. I have every reason he will do a 
report no later than September 15. At that time, he will have the 
benefit of a surge which is now, as envisioned, fully staffed and 
implemented by our complement of soldiers, together with such other 
Iraqi complements and perhaps some coalition forces, and we will then 
have been shown, did the surge work.

I, frankly, think the surge, if allowed to continue in the September 
timeframe, will have achieved a measure of what they set out to do. But 
the corollary obligation of the Iraqi Government to accept an improved 
security situation in Baghdad, created by the sacrifice of soldiers, 
sailors, and airmen, and marines in the surge, and the Iraqi fighters 
with them, they will not have taken advantage of what was achieved by 
that enormous sacrifice. That is my great concern. I hope I am wrong.

But in the time that remains, I am doubtful the concept that greater 
security in the Baghdad region will translate into greater activity and 
accomplishments by the Iraqi Government.

While there may be some military success, I don't see the signs now 
of the success that was anticipated by the Iraqi Government.

I close by saying I thank you for the opportunity. I commend you for 
your hard work and what you believe in. That is important in this 
institution, your own personal involvement and will to fight for what 
you believe. But I do urge you to take a look at what the intelligence 
community is looking at, determine the current military analysis. I say 
to my colleague from Colorado, indeed, there were a number of 
witnesses, professional retired witnesses with military experience that 
contributed to this. But again, they were looking at a situation and a 
factual basis that has substantially changed. I say to my colleagues, 
look at the intelligence, get some military analysis, and then think 
through carefully if the President has this on his desk still, it is 
there, do we need to pass a bill in the Senate and send a signal that 
would begin to engender some doubt in what we are doing now as being 
the best course of action and the risks associated with the men and 
women trying to carry forward and respond to the orders of the 
Commander in Chief. That is my fervent plea to you.

I yield the floor.
