`Mr. REID â€” 25 January 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will return to the consideration of H.R. 
2 this morning. Last night, we entered into an agreement that there be 
a vote in relation to amendment No. 158, and that vote will occur 
around 10:30 this morning. Last night, we worked on a number of 
amendments. We are anxious to meet with the Republican staff this 
morning. We are ready to vote on the DeMint amendment dealing with 
minimum wage, the Sessions amendment dealing with immigration, the 
Ensign amendment dealing with health savings accounts, the Smith 
amendment dealing with education, the Bunning amendment dealing with 
Social Security, and the Kyl amendment dealing with expensing. We hope 
to get votes on these and other amendments as the day progresses. If we 
can get other votes keyed up, it could be a late night.

We are going to vote tomorrow on the confirmation of General 
Petraeus, who will be the new commander in Iraq. The Foreign Relations 
Committee reported that out yesterday. It may have been the Armed 
Services Committee. I think it was. One of the committees reported it 
out. There is a lot of activity. It is in the Senate, and we will take 
care of that tomorrow. We are trying to line up a judge vote in the 
morning, also. Then I am going to be discussing with the distinguished 
Republican leader as to what we will do at the end of the week and get 
keyed up for next week.
