`Mr. BISHOP of New York â€” 15 February 2007`

---


Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
this resolution which is a clear and concise response on behalf of the 
majority of Americans who share our opposition to the President's 
misguided plan to escalate the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq.

We can all agree upon and indeed must take this opportunity once 
again to affirm that our support for the brave men and women of the 
United States Armed Forces is steadfast and unyielding.

As this resolution declares, our first priority must continue to be 
protecting the brave men and women in uniform who have served this 
Nation honorably and valiantly. The decision to invade Iraq is the 
single most devastating and misguided foreign policy decision our 
Nation has ever made, and the process of protecting our Nation from 
compounding this tragic error must begin this week under new leadership 
with a clear vision and a plan that finally acknowledges that we can no 
longer stay the course in Iraq.



After nearly 4 years of war, the sacrifice of more than 3,100 brave 
servicemen and -women, tens of thousands more injured, and over $600 
billion spent on the war to date, President Bush's ''mission 
accomplished'' declaration certainly rings hollow.

We must not forget whose war and misguided strategy failed us, and we 
must ask who the President is listening to beyond the small circle of 
advisers who were the architects of this fiasco in the first place.

The only strategy this administration has proposed is to stay the 
course, augmented by four earlier surges, along with the most recent 
plan to deploy the additional 21,500 U.S. troops, likely to escalate 
further to 40,000 to 60,000 more troops before the year's end. This 
latest policy is stay the course writ large.

The President's plan operates under the assumption that somehow, 
despite


all the evidence to the contrary, there is a military path to success 
if only more forces are on the ground. Not only is this logic flawed, 
it flies in the face of the wisdom of his top generals in the field, 
such as the former commander of the U.S. Central Command, John Abizaid, 
who told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ''more American 
troops right now is not the solution to the problem.''

I agree. We cannot afford to inject more of America's best and 
bravest into the chaos, particularly without the armor and training to 
protect them. Shortchanging our heroes in the face of a relentless 
insurgency is unworthy of this Nation. If we can't supply our troops 
with what they need, how can we possibly contemplate an escalation?

Without a reduction to the violence against U.S. troops, without 
stability in the region, and without evidence of a correlation between 
the raging violence and the number of U.S. troops and the number of 
trained Iraqi troops, now is the time to reduce the U.S. combat 
presence in Iraq, not expand it.

The Republican mantra has been that the Democrats don't have a plan 
for Iraq other than cut and run, an assertion that is simply false. We 
do have a comprehensive plan for Iraq that includes implementing the 
recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, a regional conference to 
engage Iraq's neighbors diplomatically, and seeking political solutions 
to the escalating turmoil in the region. But again I would ask, what 
evidence is there to suggest that this President will listen to 
anyone's plan other than his own?

This is simply not an insurgency that needs to be crushed. Confirmed 
by the President's most recent National Intelligence Estimate, Iraq is 
in a state of civil war, and thus political solutions are needed to 
address the real problem. Although al Qaeda remains active in Iraq, 
they have been surpassed by ethnic violence, the primary source of 
conflict and the most immediate threat to stability in Iraq.

Proponents of the war claim that those opposed to the surge aren't 
supporting the troops. I would ask them how we are supporting our 
troops while keeping them in a country where 70 percent of Iraqis 
believe it is acceptable to attack U.S. troops, where 78 percent 
believe that our troops provoke more violence than they prevent, where 
three-quarters of them would feel safer if American forces left Iraq.

By staying the course in Iraq, we are putting our troops in a 
situation that has no positive outcome. Aren't the lives of our troops 
more valuable than saving political face and trying to prove a point?

And while it is well known that the claims of weapons of mass 
destruction were based on faulty intelligence and there was no 
connection between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda, why are we committing 
our troops and resources towards refereeing a civil war in Iraq, 
thereby diverting resources required to win the global war on terror 
rather than fighting al Qaeda in Afghanistan, tracking down Osama bin 
Laden, and preventing another terrorist attack against America?

The President's earlier NIE made it very clear last September that 
the war in Iraq has become a primary recruitment vehicle for violent 
Islamic extremists, motivating a global jihadist movement and a new 
generation of potential terrorists around the world whose numbers may 
be increasing faster than the United States and our allies can reduce 
the threat.

Opposition to this surge does not mean a lack of support for our 
troops; rather, it affirms what the American people made clear last 
November, that our policy in Iraq is not working and that we need a new 
direction. I will vote for this resolution, and I will continue to join 
with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring our involvement in 
this misguided tragedy to an end

The NIE also indicates that, rather than contributing to eventual 
victory in the global counter-terrorism struggle, the situation in Iraq 
has diminished America's position, What additional evidence does the 
President need to prove that his policies in Iraq are only making 
matters worse for Iraqis and making the world decidedly less safe for 
America?

And to those who would argue that this resolution sends a signal to 
our enemies that we are weak and divided, you are wrong. This debate 
proves why democracy works, unites us, makes us stronger, more 
resolute, and why these strengths--that our enemies envy and seek to 
overcome--will ensure that we ultimately prevail over them.

Opposition to this surge does not mean a lack of support for our 
troops. Rather, it affirms what the American people made clear last 
November--that our policy in Iraq is not working and we need a new 
direction.

I will vote for this resolution, and I will continue to join with 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring our involvement in this 
misguided tragedy to an end. Voicing opposition to this war, to this 
President's policies, and to more of the same is our solemn 
responsibility, consistent with the objectives of this resolution, the 
hopes of the American people, and the mission of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Mr. Speaker, I commend the Majority leadership and the distinguished 
chairmen of the Armed Services and International Relations Committees 
for their hard work and making this debate a priority of this Congress.
