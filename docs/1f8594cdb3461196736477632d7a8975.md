Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, as America prepares to honor our veterans 
and those who continue to wear the uniform this weekend, the Democratic 
Congress is proud of our record over the last 10 months that has 
provided real support for our troops and our veterans.

Today, we will take a vote on a final veterans bill that increases 
funding for veterans health care by $6.7 billion, making it the single 
largest increase in veterans funding in the 77-year history of the 
Veterans Administration. This bill invests $3.8 billion more than the 
President requested.

The final conference report also includes $500 million above the 
President's request for much-needed maintenance in VA health care 
facilities, and $600 million more than the President's request for 
mental health, PTSD and traumatic brain injury. This investment is 
critically important at a time when one-third of the veterans returning 
from Iraq and Afghanistan face mental health challenges.

Madam Speaker, today let us ensure that no veteran is left behind by 
supporting this bill that fulfills our promises to our Nation's 
veterans.
