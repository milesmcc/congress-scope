Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of House Resolution 1075. I am 
pleased to join my colleagues, Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer and 
the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Representative Ike 
Skelton, both from Missouri, as well as the many cosponsors of this 
resolution, in expressing the gratitude and pride of the United States 
House of Representatives for the work of the U.S. National Guard's 
Agri-business Development Teams. The efforts of these brave men and 
women, along with their colleagues from the Department of Agriculture 
and the United States Agency for International Development, are 
critical to creating economic opportunities for nations such as 
Afghanistan.

We know all too well that Afghanistan has been devastated by nearly 
three decades of war. And such efforts, in addition to what our combat 
forces are doing, are instrumental in bringing security and stability 
to the country.

I would like to take a moment to recognize all those who serve, our 
military and civilians. I am proud to stand here today and say ''thank 
you.'' Thank you for making the choice to serve. Thank you for sharing 
your skills and expertise with the Afghan people. Thank you for 
protecting America's interests and representing the best she has to 
offer. And I thank your families as well for their sacrifices.

I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri for introducing this 
bill. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

I reserve the balance of my time.
