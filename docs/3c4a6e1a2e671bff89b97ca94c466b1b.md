`Mr. HUNTER â€” 12 July 2007`

Mr. HUNTER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

First, I want to express my great respect for my colleague, the 
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, a partner on many, many 
legislative endeavors and a gentleman who really has the welfare of the 
troops of the United States in his heart when he speaks and when he 
legislates.

But, Mr. Speaker, let me say this about this piece of legislation 
which has been brought by the Democrat leadership before this House. 
This is an attempt once again to stampede a retreat from Iraq, and it 
is a gratuitous attempt to do this. There is no reason, only 3/1/2/ 
weeks after the surge of troops has been put in place, to now race for 
the borders, to demand that the President start to wind up this 
operation and start to leave, especially when General Petraeus will be 
making recommendations to us on September 15. There is no reason to do 
this. And I am reminded of when the surge was first announced and I was 
on the floor in a discussion with a good colleague from the Democrat 
side, the day after the surge had been announced when only a few people 
were even in country from this increase in forces, and she said, There 
has been a car bombing and that proves the surge doesn't work. And she 
was ready to immediately start a retreat from the country, and I take 
it a number of folks on that side of the aisle were willing to do that.

There is no reason to do this. We have an interim report which has 
just come out. The interim report says that in the 18 areas of interest 
in which progress has to be registered, there has been progress on 
eight of them, there has been unsatisfactory progress on eight of them, 
and on two of them it is too early to really make an evaluation. Well, 
that is the interim report. And on September 15 we will get a further 
report.

And as I look at the important things, the things that to me are 
important in this report, one thing that is very important is the fact 
that when we needed to get the three additional brigades and that 
additional troop strength into Baghdad from the Iraqi Army, we got them 
there. Even though they didn't show up early on 1/1/2/ years ago, this 
time they showed up. Mr. Maliki was good on his commitment. They got 
there. So things that were important to me with respect to this report 
are being accomplished.

But the facts are we are only 27 days into this surge. And the 
Democrat resolution really spells out no plan whatsoever. It asks the 
President to come up with yet another plan, which is highly interesting 
since he has a plan and since General Petraeus has stated that he will 
recommend adjustments on September 15. So if there are adjustments to 
make to the plan, they should come after General Petraeus appears 
before us and gives us his recommended adjustments.

So what are we doing here? Well, what we are really doing is counting 
votes. This is basically an attempt by the Democrat leadership to get a 
hard vote count, see if any more people have slipped, if there are any 
more votes on their side of the aisle so that they will be able to tee 
this thing up and have another vote, hopefully, from their perspective, 
to forward their goal, which is to start a retreat from Iraq as soon as 
possible.

There is not a single recommendation in the resolution that is 
offered by my good friend. There is no recommendation for a new 
strategy. There is simply a series of questions asked of the 
administration, and those questions can all best be answered when 
General Petraeus comes before us.

So, Mr. Speaker, there are two messages that I see coming from Iraq; 
and we all see in this very complex, very difficult mission lots of 
messages. A message I saw the other day came from a senior Marine 
leader. Do you know what it said? It said, ''We are crushing the enemy 
in Anbar.'' And then a few minutes later, I saw a message from the 
Democrat leadership that said, ''We have to get out now.'' I have seen 
the Democrat leadership many times say, We are going to end this war. 
Mr. Speaker, they don't have the ability to end this war. No American 
has the ability to end this war. What they do have if they gain enough 
power is only the ability to leave this battlefield.

Let's not stampede for the border, Mr. Speaker. This is not a time to 
make a precipitous decision to start ordering the President on a policy 
that is going to be reported on on September 15. Let's keep our 
stability. Let's make sure that we don't pass this gratuitous piece of 
legislation, Mr. Speaker, which really is nothing more than a vote 
count for the Democrat leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
