Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I thank the former chairman of the Rules 
Committee for yielding.

I would just say for 4 years this Congress and this administration 
has been indifferent to the corruption in Iraq, and as a result, we 
bear some responsibility for the mess that's there now, and this 
resolution says we need to change course.
