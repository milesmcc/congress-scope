Mr. MICHAUD. I thank the chairman for yielding time to me. I also 
want to thank Ranking Member Buyer and the chairman for bringing this 
bill so quickly so we can take care of our caregivers. But I want also 
want to thank the staff on both the majority and minority sides. A lot 
of work went into this legislation to move it forward at the rapid pace 
that it was moved forward.

When our wounded heroes return home, there are many family members 
who step up to the role of a caregiver. In this effort these family 
caregivers often make great sacrifices, including giving up their job, 
delaying their education, or making other significant life-changing 
sacrifices in order to be by their loved one's side.

On June 4 of this year, the Health Subcommittee, with Ranking Member 
Henry Brown, we had a hearing to explore the needs of family caregivers 
of veterans. And based upon the findings of this hearing, I introduced 
H.R. 3155, the Caregiver Assistance and Resource Enhancement Act, 
otherwise known as the CARE Act.

The CARE Act requires the VA to train existing case managers of 
veterans so that they can inform caregivers of the benefits and 
assistance available to them.

Next, the CARE Act provides support services to family and nonfamily 
caregivers of veterans of all eras who are enrolled in the VA health 
care system.



Such services include educational sessions on how to better give 
caregivers the education and resources they need; a one-stop shop to 
support services through a dedicated caregivers Web site; and 
information and outreach. In addition, this bill provides caregivers 
with the counseling and mental health services to help cope with the 
stress of caregivers. The CARE Act also provides veterans with the 
respite care that meets their specific needs.

The CARE Act also provides a number of important benefits for 
caregivers of severely injured Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Medical 
care and monthly financial stipends will be available to primary family 
caregivers. Lodging and sustenance payments will also be provided for 
those caregivers as well.

Finally, the CARE Act requires the VA to conduct a survey of 
caregivers so that we can better understand this population for future 
improvements in the program. It is one thing to pass legislation. It is 
the next thing to make sure that the legislation is implemented 
properly and that we revise that legislation to make it work smoothly.

I also would like to take a moment to recognize the leadership of 
Mrs. Halvorson, Mr. Teague and Mr. Perriello. They are true advocates 
of caregivers, and their efforts are reflected in this bill. I want to 
thank my ranking member, Mr. Brown, for all the hard work that Mr. 
Brown and his staff did to make this bill a better bill and move it 
forward so we can vote on this here today.

I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3155, so 
that we can begin to address the needs of the caregivers who are 
everyday heroes of our veterans.
