Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today 
to recognize the tragic loss of nine soldiers stationed at Fort Carson, 
CO, who were killed this past weekend in Afghanistan.

Last Saturday, eight soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division's 4th 
Brigade Combat Team at Fort Carson were killed in a firefight by 
insurgents in a remote area of Afghanistan. From what we know, as many 
as 200 insurgents attacked two of our mountain outposts, and U.S. and 
Afghan soldiers responded together. The fighting lasted most of the 
day. When it was over, Fort Carson had seen our most costly day since 
Vietnam.

These eight young men made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. 
All Coloradans and all Americans honor their bravery and their service. 
We owe them and their families a great debt.

I wish to read the names of these courageous soldiers into the 
Record, and recognize that a ninth tragedy has also apparently now 
occurred, and say a few words about each:

SGT Vernon Martin was 25 years old. He leaves behind a wife and three 
children. After joining the Army 5 years ago, Vernon had already served 
bravely in Iraq. His wife has told people that he hoped to work with 
kids in the future. She also said he was the best thing that ever 
happened to her and their children.

SGT Justin Gallegos was 27 years old. A native of Tucson, AZ, his 
friends described him as a man of excitement, courage, leadership, and 
kindness. He is remembered for his constant smile and his generosity. 
Justin leaves behind a 5-year-old son. His family and friends will miss 
him dearly.

SGT Michael Scusa was 22 years old. After graduating from high school 
in New Jersey, he joined the Army to serve his country. Michael was 
serving his second tour in the region. Before he died, he had told his 
wife that if he was killed, he wanted to be buried in Colorado Springs 
to be close to his son. This son had been named after a friend of 
Michael's who was lost in Iraq.

SGT Joshua Kirk was 30 years old. He grew up in Idaho where his 
family still lives. He had followed his childhood dream of entering the 
Army and was serving his second tour in Afghanistan. He is survived by 
his wife and 2-year-old daughter.

SPC Stephan Mace was 21 years old. Born in Virginia, he grew up 
loving sports, wildlife, and the outdoors. His mother said that he 
always had a smile on his face. His grandfather, who had served in the 
CIA, taught Stephan what it means to serve your country. Stephan 
recently returned home for a 15-day leave trip, and his mother said 
that he returned to his post without fear.

PFC Kevin C. Thomson was 22 years old. He joined the Army just last 
year. Originally from Reno, his friends described him as the type of 
person who could make anyone laugh. He cared little for material things 
and put more emphasis on the people around him. His photograph hangs in 
the Reno grocery store where he worked after high school. He will be 
missed by his family and friends in Nevada and California.

SGT Joshua Hardt was 24 years old. He was described by family and 
friends as an extrovert and athlete. He was so talented on the field, 
actually, that his high school football helmet was retired. Seeing the 
successes of his older brother in the military, he followed his brother 
into the Army. He is survived by his wife, his hometown sweetheart, who 
moved with him to Colorado after he was stationed at Fort Carson.

SPC Christopher Griffin was 24 years old. Coming from a small town in 
Michigan, friends say they knew he would end up serving his country. 
Serving in the Army was his longtime goal. He played football and 
wrestled in high school, and made his friends laugh. Christopher's 
family in Michigan is proud of his service, and his hometown has made 
plans to name a street after him.

In addition, we recently have learned that a ninth Fort Carson 
soldier was killed in Afghanistan this weekend in a separate attack. 
SPC Kevin O. Hill, of New York, died on Sunday. He was 23 years old.

At great personal risk, these nine men braved a war in a faraway 
land. They pushed forward into great danger to protect us here at home. 
When asked, they answered the call of duty and performed their missions 
with distinction.

Coloradans are immensely grateful for their selfless dedication, and 
our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones today. 
I hope their pain is eased by the knowledge that these soldiers will 
always be remembered and honored.

Let us all remember the incredible sacrifices made by nine young 
people for America's freedom and our safety here at home. I know I 
speak for all 100 Members of the Senate in offering America's 
condolences and gratitude to all nine of these mourning families on 
this day.
