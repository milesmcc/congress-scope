Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, Iraq is the scene of the world's 
fastest growing humanitarian crisis: 4 million people displaced, half 
of whom have fled the country altogether, with another 50,000 or more 
added to the rolls every month.

What are we doing to help, especially the tens of thousands who are 
in danger because they helped the United States, like serving as 
interpreters? Last month the United States allowed exactly one Iraqi 
refugee to enter the United States.

No matter what your position is on the war in Iraq or its future, I 
urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 2265, the Responsibility to Iraqi 
Refugee Act, comprehensive legislation that would put somebody in 
charge, set modest levels for refugees entitled to come to our country, 
and authorize programs to help them. It is the least we can do for 
people whose lives are at risk because they helped Americans.
