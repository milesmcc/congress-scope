# ADMINISTRATION'S MISPLACED PRIORITIES

Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the 
latest demonstration of this administration's misplaced priorities.

President Bush wants to slash $2 billion in funding that will help 
our police and other first responders protect Americans here at home 
from terrorists and other threats so that he can send $3 billion over 
to Iraq to train police there. That money means a lot to our police and 
firefighters here at home. By cutting this funding, President Bush will 
endanger security at our ports, subways and rail lines. Further, his 
proposal will not allow law enforcement agencies to use grants for 
counterterrorism or intelligence personnel, funding which has helped 
the NYPD uncover and stop nearly 20 terrorist attacks.

By proposing these cuts, the President rejects the advice of the 
Department of Homeland Security and the 9/11 Commission and again shows 
his priorities are not those of the American people.

I urge the President to reconsider this request and will work with my 
colleagues to reverse these deeply misguided cuts to homeland security.
