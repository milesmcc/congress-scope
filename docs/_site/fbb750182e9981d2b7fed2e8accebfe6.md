`Mr. BURRIS â€” 10 November 2009`

---


Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, on November 11, 1921, exactly 2 years 
after the armistice that ended the First World War, a brave soldier was 
laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.

His grave was marked, not with a name, but with the inscription 
''Here rests in honored glory an American soldier, known but to God.''

Like all of his brothers in arms, this soldier left his home and his 
family to defend his nation in an hour of need.

Perhaps he was a factory worker or a farmer or a businessman.

Perhaps he had a wife and children; perhaps not.

But whoever he was in civilian life, he heard the call--as many have 
done before and since--and he took up arms in defense of our liberty.

He laid down his life that others might live free.

He gave what Lincoln called ''the last full measure of devotion.''

And today, although his name has been lost to the ages, the power of 
his sacrifice endures.

It is a sacrifice that every American veteran has been prepared to 
make, if duty should require it.

As we observe Veterans Day this November 11, let us express our 
thanks and appreciation for those brave veterans who are still with us.



And, in doing so, let us remember this man who was brought to his 
rest exactly 88 years ago.

He reminds us of the dear price of freedom--a price which all 
veterans must be ready to pay.

These men and women put their lives on the line to defend the United 
States.

We must recognize and honor the enormity of such patriotic devotion.

So let us celebrate the heroes who walk among us--our grandparents, 
our parents, and our children. Our friends and our neighbors.

Let us honor their sacrifice. Let us express our support, our 
friendship, and our gratitude for the service they have rendered to 
their country and all its citizens.

Their stories are woven into the story of this Nation.

These men and women have become a part of something greater than 
themselves--greater than all of us.

More than two centuries ago, when a tyrant from across the ocean 
refused to grant basic freedoms to his subjects, a brave few decided to 
claim it for themselves and for their countrymen.

When Europe was consumed by violence and genocide--when a dictator 
seemed poised to march across an entire continent--a generation of 
Americans rose to this threat and joined with our allies to save the 
world from oppression.

From the hallowed fields of Saratoga and Gettysburg, to the muddy 
trenches of France, to the rugged Korean peninsula--

From the humid jungles of Vietnam, to the arid sands of Afghanistan, 
and Iraq, and every theater of combat in between--America's veterans 
are the valiant protectors of American liberty.

We must never forget our servicemen and women--those who fought 
bravely and returned home, and those who perished on the field of 
battle.

Our freedom is their legacy.

And, just as we ask them to make great sacrifices for our Nation, so 
this country owes them a deep debt of gratitude.

We must give our veterans nothing but the very best.

As a member of the Veterans Affairs and Armed Services Committees, I 
will work with my colleagues to make sure we keep our promises to those 
who serve.

This means increasing educational benefits through programs like the 
Post-9/11 G.I. bill.

It means stepping up impact aid support to military communities.

And it means providing high quality healthcare to every single 
soldier, sailor, airman, and marine who puts on a uniform.

I will not stand for anything but the best. And I urge my colleagues 
to join me in renewing this commitment.

These men and women answered the call in America's hour of need.

And now America must be ready to answer in their hour of need.

Colleagues, let us see this Veterans Day as a time to remember--a 
time to celebrate the heroes of all wars, and to honor their service 
and sacrifice.

But let us also see this Veterans Day as a challenge for the future.

Let us see it as a time to keep our promises, and to fight for those 
who have fought for us.

Eighty-eight years ago, a brave soldier was laid to rest at Arlington 
National Cemetery under the inscription ''Here rests in honored glory 
an American soldier, known but to God.''

And although we call him the Unknown Soldier, in reality he is 
anything but unknown.

He is our countryman--our brother--our protector.

He is every American soldier, past and present.

His sacrifice lives in our freedom. His service is carried on by all 
those who wear the American flag into combat, and all who perish under 
its standard.

My friends, this Veterans Day is a time for remembrance and 
celebration.

It is a time for American heroes.
