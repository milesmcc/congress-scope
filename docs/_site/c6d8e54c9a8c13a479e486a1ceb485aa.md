`Mr. ENSIGN â€” 31 January 2007`

---


Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss the Iraqi 
situation. Not the shootings and explosions we see in the streets of 
Baghdad and in al Anbar Province, but the struggle were currently 
engaged in right here in the Senate.

This latter battle is arguably more important to our long-term 
national security than any other issue we face today.

While everyone remembers the tragedy of 9/11, the pain and anguish 
experienced by Americans that day appears to have faded over time for 
an ever increasing number of our citizens.

For me, it remains as vivid and as gut wrenching today as it was that 
September morning more than 5 years ago.

It seems too easy these days to point fingers of blame at one another 
for our current situation in Iraq.

I could stand here today and recite quote after quote from Members on 
both sides of the aisle who were certain that Saddam Hussein possessed 
weapons of mass destruction.

Hussein and his Baathist regime had ruled Iraq as a personal fiefdom 
for more than 30 years.

There is no arguing that Hussein was personally responsible for the 
brutal deaths of hundreds of thousands of his own citizens, invaded two 
of his neighbors, supported worldwide terrorism, and violated 17 
separate United Nations resolutions aimed at curtailing his WMD 
programs.

Seventy-seven Senators voted to give President Bush the authority to 
act.

With the clear authority from Congress to undertake military 
operations against Saddam Hussein, President Bush tried long and hard 
to seek a peaceful resolution. Saddam Hussein could not be reasoned 
with.

Following 9/11 and in an age of nuclear bombs and other weapons of 
mass destruction, we could no longer afford to sit by and wait on those 
wanting to do us harm to land the first punch.

We could not wait until we were attacked before acting. Calls for the 
President to act in order to protect America were loud and clear. And 
the President did act.

In doing so, Saddam Hussein's regime was eliminated and some 28 
million Iraqis were freed from a living hell on Earth.

Watching the Iraqis struggle since then to establish their own 
democracy has not been a pretty sight.

With the luxury of hindsight, it's no secret that serious mistakes 
were made; too few troops; de-baathification of the Iraqi government 
and; failure of Federal Departments other than Defense to be fully 
engaged in this effort, to name a few.

We need to face the fact that we are in Iraq. We need to ask 
ourselves what do we do now.

Do we pack up and leave, even though every voice of reason tells us 
that Iraq would implode into a terrorist state used by al-Qaida as a 
launching pad against the ''infidels''; reminiscent of Afghanistan 
under the Taliban?

As Senator McCain has reminded us time and again, Iraq is not 
Vietnam. When we left South Vietnam, the Viet Cong did not pursue us 
back to our shores. . .

Al-Qaida is not the Viet Cong. Al-Qaida has sworn to destroy us and 
is committed to bringing their brand of terror to America.

This fact was evidenced recently during testimony by Lieutenant 
General Maples, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

He testified that documents captured by coalition forces during a 
raid of a safe house believed to house Iraqi members of al-Qaida 6 
months ago revealed al-Qaida was planning terrorist operations in the 
U.S. Anyone willing to go to Iraq to fight Americans is probably 
willing to travel to America.

Do we pass meaningless resolutions that mandate unconstitutional caps 
on the number of troops deployed to Iraq?

I am not a military strategist, so I rely on the opinion of experts 
to educate me.

General Petraeus, the new commander of the Iraqi Multi-National 
Coalition and author of the Army's new Counter Insurgency Manual, told 
me that he could not succeed in providing security for the citizens of 
Baghdad and al Anbar Province without the additional troops called for 
in the President's plan.

Do we allow the President the ability to adjust those troop numbers 
in an effort to bring security to Baghdad and al Anbar Province?

From what I see, the President has the only plan on the table that 
doesn't ensure defeat. It may not be a perfect plan, and it may need to 
be adjusted in the near term, but it is certainly a change from what 
we've been doing so far.

One particular area that I believe needs improvement is our 
reconstruction effort.

According to the Congressional Research Service the United States has 
spent over $35.6 billion on reconstruction efforts.

We have to stop squandering our resources on reconstruction projects 
in Iraq that fail to deliver basic security and critical 
infrastructure.

A recent article in the Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding 
talked of the need to abandon a scattergun approach to reconstruction 
which focuses on winning hearts and minds and results in many 
nonessential projects being started but not completed.

I believe that we need to have what the author called a triage 
approach to reconstruction. The military calls it SWEAT: sewage, water, 
electricity and trash.

Let's focus on getting these essential services operating at the 
level they were before we invaded Iraq. This approach will undoubtedly 
make our military effort easier.

Our efforts to improve fundamental services up to this point have not 
received the focus and attention they deserve.

We have fallen short in the area of electricity production. Before we 
invaded Iraq, electric power was 95,600 megawatt hours; now, it is 
close to 90,000 megawatt hours. The goal was originally 120,000 
megawatt hours.

In Baghdad, Iraqis receive about three fewer hours of electricity 
than before the war. Outside of Baghdad they do receive more, but we 
know most of the problems are in Baghdad. CRS notes that of 425 
projects planned in the electricity sector, only 300 will be completed.

We have done somewhat better in assistance with water and sanitation.

We have provided clean water to 4.6 million more people and 
sanitation to 5.1 million more than before the war. But besides water, 
sanitation, and


electricity we know that Iraq needs a functioning oil sector.

Revenues from oil are necessary to fund government services, 
including security and maintain infrastructure. According to CRS, oil 
and gas production has remained stagnant and below pre-war levels for 
some time.

The pre-war level of oil production was 2.5 million barrels per day; 
it currently stands at 2.0 million barrels per day.

That is far below the 3.0 million barrels per day we were told Iraq 
was expected to reach by end of 2004. According to the Special 
Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, besides the destruction 
caused by the insurgents, poor infrastructure, corruption, and 
difficulty maintaining and operating U.S.-funded projects are 
challenges faced by the industry.

We are at a pivotal point in this Nation's history.

We face an enemy unlike anything ever witnessed before. We cannot 
wash our hands of the responsibility incumbent upon us as the leader of 
the free world.

It is time to join together, forgetting whether we are Republicans, 
whether we are Democrats, remembering we are Americans. It is time to 
come together behind our men and women in uniform, figure out what the 
best strategies are, and move forward together. It used to be said that 
partisanship stopped at our shore's edge. We need to go back to that 
spirit of being Americans. We cannot afford to fail in this effort.

I yield the floor.
