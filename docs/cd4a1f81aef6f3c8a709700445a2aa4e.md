Ms. WOOLSEY. I just want to say you also should put the cost of not 
doing those things, the cost of not having a healthy community, not 
having an educated constituency, not having people ready for jobs for 
the 21st century. Those costs, we never look at that when we are doing 
our budgeting.

I have a question, if I may, to just throw out to the three of you. 
Sam, before you came down here we were talking about 150,000 
contractors in Iraq and why our military, which is one-third of the 
cost, each one of our troops, why we just didn't have them doing it 
all.

My question is, wouldn't we have to have a draft in order to have 
that many troops available? I don't think we have volunteers that would 
be able to double the size of the troops in the units over in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, because I don't think people are that excited about going 
over there for $50,000 a year, for one thing.
