`Mr. SESSIONS â€” 12 April 2007`

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.

I thank my colleague from South Dakota. I believe his National Guard 
per capita is one of the largest National Guards in the country. I know 
mine is, both on a per-capita and aggregate basis. We have soldiers in 
Iraq right now from our home States. I talked to the mother of a 
soldier who was recently killed, and this is a painful subject for us 
all. At this very moment throughout Baghdad, Al Anbar Province, 
American soldiers are walking those streets, working closely with Iraqi 
soldiers, Iraqi police officers, in an effort to create stability so 
that political agreements can be reached that could lead to a stable 
and successful Iraq. This is an extremely, deeply important matter. Now 
we are in a situation in which our leader in the Senate, Democratic 
leader, Senator Reid, has said they intend to fund our troops. They 
intend to provide the money the President needs to conduct this war, 
but at the same time they want to tell the generals how to conduct it. 
They want to say that on a given date we have to move troops in this 
direction or that direction, and we will begin to bring troops home 4 
months from today, regardless of the conditions in Iraq, regardless of 
what the military experts say, without any real thought, if you want to 
know the truth.

I have been to Iraq four times and will be soon going my fifth. Very 
few


people in the Senate have been there so often. I submit we don't know 
sufficiently how to direct the deployment of our troops. I don't know. 
Who knows the best? General Petraeus? This is his third full tour over 
there. He has studied insurgencies and written a Department of Defense 
manual on how to defeat an insurgency.

Who is the best qualified to make these decisions? This is not a 
little matter. We voted, over three-fourths of this Senate, to 
authorize military force in Iraq. Our soldiers are doing what we asked 
them to do--not what they want to do, what their duty is.

A father of a military Army officer told me right out here a few 
weeks ago--his son was about to go to Iraq--he said: Senator, they are 
watching you like a hawk. Our soldiers over there are watching what we 
in Congress do. They wonder what is going on.

They are putting their necks on the line for the policies we asked 
them to do, and they hear this kind of talk, they hear of this delay. 
We can't get even the emergency supplemental passed. It is very 
discouraging to me. I don't believe this is an action worthy of a 
responsible Senate. We know this Senate has the power, this Congress 
has the power to shut off funding for the war in Iraq and bring our 
troops home immediately.

But if we are not going to do that--and the Democratic leader said we 
are not going to do that, we are going to give them the money they need 
under this supplemental--if we are not going to bring them home, and we 
are going to give them the money, for Heaven's sakes, let's don't 
micromanage what they do, and let's don't demand commitments from the 
Commander in Chief he cannot agree to.

He cannot agree to 100 Senators telling him when and how to deploy 
the troops. What would General Petraeus think? What would his 
responsibility be to his general whom he asked to serve, who is 
serving, whom he told would be given responsibility to be successful in 
Iraq and bring stability there, with his whole effort focused on that?

I wish to share with my colleagues a deep concern that we not get 
into some sort of game of chicken with the President and the Congress. 
I must say, I am glad the Democratic leaders apparently said last 
night, after earlier saying no, now they will meet with the President 
at his request to discuss their differences.

But it is not just a political game of chicken between the Congress 
and the President; we have soldiers in the field whose lives are at 
risk this very moment. They need better support than that. Our allies 
need to know we are not going to be acting in a way this Senate 
resolution suggests. The enemy needs to know we are not going to be 
acting in that fashion, in my view.

We have a tough challenge over there, there is no doubt about it. 
General Petraeus committed, at my request, that if he thought what we 
were doing would not be successful, he would not hesitate to tell the 
Congress and the American people exactly that. I believe he will. Right 
now, he believes he can be successful. If we allow him to do so, I 
believe he will be.

Mr. President, I see others on the floor. I conclude by saying I 
believe we ought not to be in this posture of brinksmanship over this 
issue. I believe it is irresponsible. I believe it places those 
soldiers we have sent at greater risk for their lives, and their 
mission is placed in a situation where it would be more difficult to 
accomplish. That is something we should not do. I hope cooler heads 
will prevail.
