Mr. KUCINICH. Afghan President Karzai is in Washington this week 
seeking another $33 billion to keep the war going, meeting with the 
White House to present his so-called ''peace proposal'' to allocate 
$160 million from international donors to fund new government bodies, 
pay off insurgents who agree to stop fighting, and to undermine efforts 
to establish local governance.

Ranked the second most corrupt government in the world, only behind 
Somalia, Mr. Karzai's blatant government corruption, his ties to Big 
Oil, and his ties to Afghanistan's most notorious drug pushers, 
including his own brother, is no secret. While he's being treated as 
royalty in Washington, millions of dollars shuffle through Kabul 
Airport, unaccounted for, as Mr. Karzai builds villas in Dubai. 
Meanwhile, I have constituents in Cleveland who are struggling to stay 
in their homes.

The longer this charade of nation building and counterinsurgency 
strategy in Afghanistan continues, the more U.S. soldiers and innocent 
Afghan civilians die. He wants $33 billion for war to continue in 
Afghanistan. Here at home, Americans need jobs and access to education 
and health care. Billions would be better spent rebuilding America than 
sending it to Afghanistan to continue a war.

Bring our troops home. End the war.
