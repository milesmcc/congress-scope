Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to say to the 
gentlewoman, thank you very much. I would point out that the Iraq Study 
Group was an instrument created by both sides of the aisle, but 
particularly by Mr. Wolf. It is a bipartisan effort, and it would be 
good to continue this bipartisan effort.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Wolf).
