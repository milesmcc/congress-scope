Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Boyd), the 
administrative cochair of the Blue Dogs for his insight and examples of 
waste, fraud and abuse that's going on with your tax money over in 
Iraq.

If you have got any comments or concerns or questions of us, you can 
e-mail us at bluedog@mail.house.gov. That is bluedog@mail.house.gov.

Again, this is an hour where most Tuesday evenings we come and lead a 
discussion about accountability and fiscal discipline in our government 
by the Blue Dog Coalition.

If you are wondering how in the world did we get our name, Blue Dog 
Coalition, a lot of folks, especially in the South, have heard of a 
Yellow Dog Democrat, meaning you would vote for a Democrat even if it 
was a yellow dog as long as it was running as a Democrat. Somewhere 
along the way we were Yellow Dog Democrats that felt we were being 
choked blue by the extremes of both parties. Thus the name the Blue Dog 
Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative, commonsense Democrats that 
are trying to restore fiscal discipline and accountability to our 
government.

At this time I am pleased to turn this thing over to a former policy 
cochair of the Blue Dogs, the gentleman from Tennessee, Jim Cooper.
