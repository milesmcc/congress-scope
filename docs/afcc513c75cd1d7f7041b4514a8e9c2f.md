Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, a man from Kansas said, ''Every gun that 
is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the 
final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who 
are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money 
alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its 
scientists, and the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at 
all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging 
on a cross of iron.'' Dwight David Eisenhower, April 16, 1953.

I ask that the rest of my time be in silence for those who have died 
in Iraq, Americans and Iraqis.
