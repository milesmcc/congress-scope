`Mr. ALLEN â€” 2 October 2007`

---


Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, on October 1, 2007, I was absent from the 
House due to a death in the family. Had I been present, I would have 
voted ''yea'' on rollcall Vote No. 924, a motion by Ms. Castor to 
suspend the rules and pass H. Con. Res. 185, a resolution commending 
the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division of the Minnesota 
National Guard upon its completion of the longest continuous deployment 
of any United States military unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

I would also have voted ''yea'' on rollcall Vote No. 925, a motion by 
Mr. Clay to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 2276, a bill to designate 
the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 203 North 
Main Street in Vassar, Michigan, as the ''Corporal Christopher E. 
Esckelson Post Office Building.''

Finally, I would have voted ''yea'' on rollcall Vote No. 926, a 
motion by Mr. Clay to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 3325, a bill to 
designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 
235 Mountain Road in Suffield, Connecticut, as the ''Corporal Stephen 
R. Bixler Post Office.''
