Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the War 
Supplemental Appropriations Bill, H.R. 2346.

The illegitimate war in Iraq undermines our credibility on the world 
stage as we continue to occupy the country. Over 4,300 Americans and 
estimated hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed in 
a war fought over lies. The conflict in Afghanistan was ignored while 
the previous administration led the American people into war with Iraq. 
We need to withdraw our troops and direct our support to humanitarian 
aid and a stable civilian government.

These wars have cost us the ability to properly address the biggest 
problems facing our country. Healthcare reform, our economy, and 
reforming energy policy are top priorities of Congress. We cannot 
justify hundreds of billions of dollars for these wars at the expense 
of the American taxpayer.

I urge my colleagues to vote against the war.
