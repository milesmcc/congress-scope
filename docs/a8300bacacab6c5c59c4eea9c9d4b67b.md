`Mr. INHOFE â€” 26 September 2008`

---


Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the reason I came here today was to 
recognize and pay tribute to SSG Brandon Farley. He is from Haworth, in 
southeastern Oklahoma. Since April of 2007, he was assigned to the 1st 
Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, and 1st 
Infantry Division at Fort Hood.

Brandon died Thursday, September 18, of wounds sustained a day 
earlier when his patrol was attacked by enemy forces in Able Monti, 
Afghanistan. This was his third deployment, serving in Operation 
Enduring Freedom at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan.

Brandon was born in Sulphur Springs, TX, and spent his teenage years 
in Haworth, OK, where he graduated from high school. Soon after 
graduating from high school, he joined the Marines and served 4 years. 
It was during those first 4 years in the military that he served his 
first tour in Iraq. So he was there first as a marine. Later, he was 
honorably discharged, went into the National Guard, and then he missed 
the regular services so he joined the Army. So he was stationed in Iraq 
and Afghanistan both as a marine and as an Army soldier, a truly 
outstanding young man.

His uncle William Gilpin is quoted as saying:




 It was his intention to retire from the army. He had a 


 commitment to his country.


So he was going to stay there for a career; the kind of people we 
look for all the time.

Corey, Brandon's brother, also spoke about his brother's commitment 
and service to the military and our Nation. He said:




 He loved serving his country. He was a go-getter who had 


 talked about joining the military ever since he was 16.


As Corey talked to him about his deployments, Brandon told him that 
although there were good and bad times, he reenlisted because he 
''loved what he was doing.''

As the oldest of four, Brandon was committed to his family and 
enjoyed spending lots of time with them and his many friends. He leaves 
behind his father Wade and mother Sherry, and many others. He is also 
survived by a brother and sister-in-law, Corey and Brandy, sisters 
Ashlyn and Lauren, and two nephews.

Brandon loved being outdoors, four wheeling, and riding his 
motorcycles around. Brandon's brother Corey said:




 I can remember fishing down at the creek and being outside 


 when we were like 10 or 12 years old. Usually it had 


 something to do with a slingshot or a BB gun.


Brandon's sister Lauren left this heartfelt message to her beloved 
brother on his on-line guest book:




 Brandon, you are my brave big brother. I miss you so much--


 words cannot describe. I sit here thinking of you day and 


 night. All the memories we had and all the memories that were 


 cut short. I am so proud of you. You will always be my big 


 brother. Thank you for all you have done for us. All my love, 


 your little sis Lauren.


Lauren's expression of Brandon's bravery is clearly true. With 
bravery and courage he faced war and fought for our freedom. He 
willingly went into battle not only one time but three times. Brandon 
was a true patriot who gave the ultimate sacrifice--his life--for his 
country.

A friend wrote in his journal--and I will end with this particularly 
touching and revealing sentiment:




 You were truly amazing. A dear friend, a top-notch soldier, 


 and a super human being. This is a great loss and it will be 


 grieved greatly. I am so proud of you and bragged about your 


 service all the time. I shed tears for you a little bit but I 


 smile knowing that you believe in God and accepted Christ as 


 your savior and that I will be reunited with you one day. 


 Thank you Brandon.


It is kind of coincidental. We had three other Oklahomans who died in 
a helicopter crash that we visited about yesterday, and all three of 
them also knew the Lord. So you kind of look at that and you say: Well, 
this is a wicked time we are in right now, and we will be with you 
shortly. I say to Brandon's family: I pray you will feel God's peace 
and comfort and know that we appreciate you very much and the price 
Brandon paid for us. You will be together again soon.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
