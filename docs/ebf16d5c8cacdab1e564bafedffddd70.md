`Mr. KIRK â€” 16 July 2008`

Mr. KIRK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, successful counterterror campaigns teach that to win, 
you must attack both terrorists and their money.

Through our congressional partisan lens, the Iraq war is sometimes 
described as the ''bad war'' while Afghanistan is described as the 
''good war.'' Our partisan lens does not allow us to recognize any good 
news from Iraq, and also blocks bad news from Afghanistan. But in 
Afghanistan, we see that the Taliban is back, funded by billions from 
the sale of heroin.

Last month, security situations in Afghanistan worsened, and the 
Taliban set new records for intensity, scope and frequency of their 
attacks. The numbers of districts under stress, the number of district 
centers attacked, and the number of roadside car bombs and suicide 
bombs all dramatically increased. In total, the death toll in June 
alone numbered over 40 NATO casualties, including 27 Americans, 
representing the highest number killed in


any single month in 7 years of conflict in Afghanistan.

According to open-source reporting on NATO-Taliban fire fights, the 
Taliban has not run out of people, ammunition or supplies. And NATO 
ground forces did not win every battle, a new and troubling 
development.

For many years, Afghanistan has become the world's leading producer 
of heroin, responsible for roughly 92 percent of the world's supply. 
But the U.N. now reports that in 2008, Afghanistan has become the top 
producer of hashish as well. Money from heroin, and now profits from 
hashish, total hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. In 
sum, the Taliban's drug profits may equal the operations budget of 
General McKiernan and his NATO army. This amendment will help focus the 
broader intelligence community on the clear nexus between narcotics and 
terrorism.

The hot issue yesterday was a surge in troops to Afghanistan backed 
by both Senators Obama and McCain. I would sound a note of caution, 
though, that without aerial spraying and other counterdrug programs 
that have worked in Pakistan and Colombia, such an Afghan move would 
only accelerate violence between two now very well-funded opponents.

To turn the rising Taliban tide, we must now effectively move against 
heroin, and now hashish, in the narcostate that is now Afghanistan. 
This amendment will commission a National Intelligence Estimate to look 
at the nexus between drug profits and terrorism.

We all note the record of the past. In 2001, the leader of the 
Taliban, Mullah Omar, claimed to have eradicated the entire heroin crop 
of Afghanistan. That is what his PR agents wanted you to know. What 
they did not want you to know is Mullah Omar had stockpiled 300 tons of 
opium paste in warehouses south of Kandahar in an effort similar to 
what the Hunt brothers did with the silver market, trying to corner the 
market in opium and heroin.

In 2002, after coalition troops moved to replace the Taliban plan, 
our Ambassador to Afghanistan, Zal Khalilzad, convinced the new 
President, Hamid Karzai, to be against aerial spraying, saying that it 
would recall memories of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That 
single move crippled counternarcotic programs in that country. Without 
aerial spraying, just to spray the leader's field, as has been done in 
Pakistan and Colombia, heroin production rose from no provinces in 
2001, to 29 of 34 provinces today.

Such a rise in drug production led to enormous profits. And when 
asked the question, who is the chief financier of the Taliban, and 
partially of al Qaeda, the leading counternarcotics adviser to 
President Hamid Karzai told me it was Haji Bashir Noorzai, the banker 
to the Taliban.

In a very successful operation by the DEA, Haji Bashir Noorzai was 
lured first to the U.A.E., and then to New York City, where he was 
indicted in the Southern District of New York and is currently 
incarcerated. It was a great triumph for the United States, putting 
Haji Bashir Noorzai on the cover of Time magazine and underscoring the 
important contribution that the Drug Enforcement Agency can add to the 
intelligence community.

At the time, DEA was not part of the intelligence community. By 
action of the last Congress, we brought DEA into the intelligence 
community and supplied them with new intelligence collection assets to 
operate in Afghanistan. It is because DEA is in, that with their 
intelligence, this amendment should pass.
