Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, let me just very briefly outline 
exactly what we are after in this bill.

First of all, this is a responsible effort for redeployment so that 
we can refocus and fight the war on terror. The situation in Iraq is a 
civil war compounded by civil wars that have been going on ever since 
Abraham, Hagar, Sarah, Isaac, Ishmael, Esau, Mohammed and his son-in-
law, which has broken into the Shi'as and the Sunnis; hundreds of 
thousands of years, folks.

None of the people from Iraq came to this country and asked, please 
come over and pump in $500 billion, 3,600 of the lives of your precious 
sons and daughters to make a democracy for us. That was a decision that 
was made counter to the authorization in the first place. It was a go 
against weapons of mass destruction.

It is responsible. It is focused. We need to do it, and I urge 
passage of this bill.
