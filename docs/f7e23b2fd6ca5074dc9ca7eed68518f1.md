Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, I spent 31 years in the military defending 
our freedom of speech. I often wondered and hoped during those years, 
whether in the fury of war or the challenges of peace, what Washington 
was thinking, debating wisely at length about the use of our national 
treasure, those men and women who wear the cloth of our Nation 
overseas.

I am concerned for U.S. security because of Iraq, a tragic 
misadventure that does not permit us to best address more important 
security challenges throughout this world.

Don't double down on a bad military bet by using more troops. Have 
confidence in our diplomatic ability to lead even with Syria and Iran, 
set a date certain for redeploying out of Iraq this year to serve as 
the leverage to have the Iraqis accept the reality of the personal 
consequence of not assuming responsibility for their nation.

That is why I will introduce legislation that sets the end of 2007 
for our redeployment from Iraq to serve as the catalyst for the Iraqis 
to assume responsibility for their country so we can better address our 
security interests throughout this world.
