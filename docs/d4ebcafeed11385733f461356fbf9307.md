Mr. REID. Madam President, President Obama has articulated a sound 
strategy for surging our force in Afghanistan, a well-defined mission 
to enable them to succeed, and a clear plan to begin to bring those 
troops home starting next July. His plan honors the service of the 100 
Nevadans in Afghanistan today and those of every American fighting 
terrorists abroad to keep us safer at home.

I have always believed that our commitment in Afghanistan should not 
be open-ended, which is why I continue to support the President's plan. 
We have begun to reverse the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan and 
weakened al-Qaeda's operations, safe havens and leadership in the 
region. Our troops will continue to defeat those terrorist networks and 
others like it and we will continue to press the Afghan government to 
end corruption and take responsibility for governing the country. But, 
as the President's plan makes clear, these troops have a clear task in 
place: to reverse the Taliban's momentum and to begin returning home 
next July.

In light of the President's strategy and the recent progress, now is 
not the time to change course.
