Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, our intelligence agencies have 
confirmed that America is more vulnerable now than it was 6 years ago 
before the 9/11 attacks. That is because Osama bin Laden has gained 
strength, gained recruits and gained experience in the meantime.

It didn't have to be that way. We had him cornered and crippled in 
Tora Bora, but then we outsourced the job of capturing him. Then, to 
make matters worse, we poured our military and financial resources into 
Iraq, where al Qaeda was nonexistent, thereby giving Osama bin Laden 
his most effective recruiting tool.

The President keeps referring to al Qaeda in Iraq. It is not the 
Iraqis who are planning on how to attack America. It is al Qaeda in 
Waziristan. We need an intelligence strategy to go after bin Laden in 
Waziristan with our Special Operations working with the tribal chiefs 
who want to rid themselves of this pest. That is what we need to do.

Mr. Speaker, that is the only strategy that is deserving of the 
sacrifice of our military families. We need leadership that is 
deserving of the American public's support.
