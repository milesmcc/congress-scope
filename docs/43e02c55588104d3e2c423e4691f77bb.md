Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, there will be a conference committee report 
by the Senate and the House on the Iraq supplement, and the Iraq 
supplement will have a requested date, suggested date for our 
withdrawal.

It's not saying we have been defeated. We have won the war. America 
has won the war. Saddam Hussein's government was toppled and Saddam 
Hussein is history. We are now in an occupation, and you cannot win an 
occupation.

You cannot defeat beliefs with bullets. What we have in Iraq and in 
the Middle East are beliefs that are different from ours, and they can 
only be won by understanding and through changes, which God would put 
in people's hearts, and not through bullets. We need a bill to support 
our troops, and our bill will support our troops with more money than 
the administration gave it.

I ask the President to support the troops with the bill that the 
Congress will give him and support our troops and bring them home.
