Mr. SNYDER. Mr. Speaker, people in Arkansas want to be safe and they 
want to feel safe. Everyone in America wants to be safe and have a 
strong national defense. National security means a strong military. 
National security also means that all the tools in our tool box must be 
available, including the capacity and availability of the civilian side 
of our government.

Mr. Farr has been leading this charge, along with Mr. Saxton, and I 
appreciate the great work of Mr. Berman stepping into his new role, to 
bring forth this issue that all the tools of U.S. strength must be 
available. As Mrs. Davis was pointing out, we have a lot of work to do 
beyond this bill in terms of the coordination of all our different 
agencies.



I was talking to one of my constituents who is a civilian working in 
Iraq, and she said, You know, I sometimes think the differences in 
conflicts between the agencies of the U.S. Government are greater than 
the differences between us and the Iraqis. I think that really brings 
home the issues and challenges that we have.

But this bill today is a great step towards making sure that we have 
all the tools in our tool box that we need for our national security, 
and I applaud its passage today.
