## `42ae2279da149c9c30decac18f4e76c9`
`Mr. WARNER â€” 10 July 2008`

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank all the Members of the Senate. We 
just had two historic votes. The men and women in the Armed Forces, 
particularly those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, will be greatly 
heartened to hear that the Senate has given the strongest possible 
advice and consent, each Member coming to the floor and casting their 
vote. I think it is a landmark situation and one which is respected and 
appreciated across our uniformed services and the many civilians who 
serve with them.

I yield the floor.
