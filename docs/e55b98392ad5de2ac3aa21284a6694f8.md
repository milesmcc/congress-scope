Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, right now, brave Americans are 
going door to door in some of the most dangerous parts of Iraq. They 
are working with the Iraqi people to bring stability to Iraq, and they 
are doing this because it is their duty and because they understand our 
enemy, what is at stake should we not succeed.

Right now, in households all across this country, there are families 
praying for the safe return of their loved ones. They understand the 
dangers. They know what is at stake. Unfortunately, in Washington, it 
would seem that too many politicians do not realize what is at stake, 
what the consequences are of failure. Instead, some propose we tell 
these soldiers and their families that Congress believes that the only 
choice is to close the door. They say retreat is our only option. Their 
desire is to adopt a policy of slow bleed, methodically squeezing off 
the necessary funding.

We all know our enemy is committed. We also know that this slow-bleed 
tactic, supported by some here in Washington, is a weakly disguised 
measure to turn our backs on our soldiers. That is something, Madam 
Speaker, that I cannot support.
