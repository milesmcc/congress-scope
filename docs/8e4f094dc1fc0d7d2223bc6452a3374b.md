`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 8 December 2010`

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Donald L. 
Carcieri, Governor of the State of Rhode Island, for his remarkable 
leadership in the Ocean State. Governor Carcieri will conclude his 
second term as Governor in January after serving two incredible terms. 
His record of public service and advocacy for the people of Rhode 
Island is simply unmatched.

Governor Carcieri was inaugurated as Rhode Island's 57th Governor on 
January 7, 2003. A native Rhode Island resident, his election followed 
a career in business that was capped with his tenure as Chief Executive 
Officer of Cookson America and Joint Managing Director of Cookson Group 
Worldwide. He retired from that position in 1997.

Governor Carcieri, born December 16, 1942, was the first of Nicola 
and Marguerite Carcieri's five children. The family lived in East 
Greenwich where Nicola Carcieri was a beloved teacher and coach at the 
town high school. As a family man with four children and fourteen 
grandchildren, ten of whom live in Rhode Island, Governor Carcieri has 
always taken an active interest in what is going on in his community 
and the state.

Governor Carcieri has been instrumental in preserving the historic 
face of Providence: at his urging, the former Providence train station 
became the headquarters of Cookson America. The company offices 
overlooked Burnside Park on one side and the Rhode Island State House 
on the other. He exhibited unwavering leadership during the tragic 
Station nightclub fire and during the state's disastrous floods. He 
memorialized Rhode Island's heroes who fell during the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

I wish Don all the best in his future endeavors. He will continue to 
carry my own admiration, and that of all who have had the privilege to 
work with him.
