Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, it is with profound sadness that we 
commemorate the death of a Wisconsin native son, 26-year-old Sergeant 
Nickolas


Mueller, who was killed in action on October 26 during military 
operations in Afghanistan.

In 2002, a graduate of Little Chute High School, Sergeant Mueller was 
a member of the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, 
stationed in Savannah, Georgia.

And after serving 2 years in Korea, Sergeant Mueller became crew 
chief on an elite Chinook helicopter unit, known as the Night Stalkers, 
whose duties included inserting and taking out our troops from 
dangerous territory.

That Sergeant Mueller was several times decorated is not surprising 
to those who knew him. In high school, he was a member of the Mustangs' 
football team and wrestling teams. He was a regular participant. He was 
the king of homecoming in 2001.

That he was entrusted with the highly technical responsibilities of a 
crew chief is not surprising either. Nick is remembered by his family 
and friends for his fearless willingness to accept any challenge.

On behalf of the people of northeast Wisconsin, we offer our deepest 
condolences to his mother and father, Sharon and Larry Mueller, and his 
brother, John.

Sergeant Nick Mueller shall not be forgotten.
