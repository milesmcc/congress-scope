Mr. KUCINICH. This House cannot avoid its constitutionally authorized 
responsibility to restrain the abuse of executive power. The 
administration has been preparing for an aggressive war against Iran. 
There is no solid, direct evidence that Iran has the intention of 
attacking the United States or its allies. The U.S. is a signatory to 
the U.N. Charter, a constituent treaty among the nations of the world. 
Article II, section 4, of the U.N. charter states, ''All members shall 
refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of 
force against the territorial integrity or political independence of 
any state.'' Even the threat of a war of aggression is illegal. Article 
VI of the U.S. Constitution makes such treaties the supreme law of the 
land. This administration has openly threatened aggression against Iran 
in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the U.N. Charter.

This week, the House Appropriations Committee removed language from 
the Iraq war funding bill requiring the administration under Article I, 
section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution to seek permission before it 
launched an attack against Iran. Since war with Iran is an option of 
this administration and such war is patently illegal, then


impeachment may well be the only remedy which remains to stop a war of 
aggression against Iran.
