# SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn an unconscionable 
commercial from last night's Super Bowl. Some ads were good, some ads 
were bad; but this one was very ugly. For those who missed it, an 
antiwar political action committee ran an ad claiming, and this is a 
direct quote: ''If you support escalation, you don't support the 
troops.''

Well, Mr. Speaker, that couldn't be farther from the truth. 
Supporting additional troops in Iraq is supporting one final surge to 
push the Iraqi people over the threshold of violence and deliver the 
best shot for a more stable Middle East.

Let me assure you that the veterans in this commercial do not speak 
for the veterans in my district, nor do they speak for the soldiers 
that I visited in Iraq or Walter Reed, nor do they speak for our 
military commanders. But, Mr. Speaker, what disturbs me most about this 
commercial is that it wasn't just broadcast to those of us watching the 
game from the comfort of our living rooms and our homes. It was 
broadcast to the troops watching the game in Iraq.

Our troops should know that the United States military strategy will 
not be determined by political groups buying air time during the Super 
Bowl. I support victory in Iraq, and this final surge may be our best 
last chance to achieve it.
