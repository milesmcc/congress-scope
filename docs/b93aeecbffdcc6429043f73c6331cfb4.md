`Mr. WU â€” 10 January 2007`

---


Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, this administration took America to 
war in Iraq without adequate evidence. Since that time, the 
administration has not listened to the American people, it hasn't 
listened to our professional military, and it certainly hasn't listened 
to this Congress.

It was said of a prominent businessman in downtown Portland that he 
never listened to anybody and that if he was ever drawn in a cartoon he 
would be drawn without ears.

Now, this President has listened to some people, the so-called 
Vulcans in the White House, the ideologues. But unlike the Vulcans of 
Star Trek, who made the decisions based on logic and fact, these guys 
make it on ideology. These aren't Vulcans. There are Klingons in the 
White House. But unlike the real Klingons of Star Trek, these Klingons 
have never fought a battle of their own.

Don't led faux Klingons send real Americans to war. It is wrong.
