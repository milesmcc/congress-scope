`Mr. WYDEN â€” 5 May 2010`

---


Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in Oregon, we just honored the return of 
2,700 members of the Oregon National Guard's 41st Brigade Combat Team. 
Although the 41st's service in Iraq was Oregon's biggest single 
contribution to a war effort since World War II, it is not the only 
one.

The soldiers of the Oregon National Guard's 162nd Engineer Company 
are currently clearing roads in Afghanistan. The 1249 Engineer 
Battalion in Salem, OR, is preparing to deploy to Afghanistan this 
winter, and about 600 soldiers from Eastern Oregon will be part of the 
116th Cavalry when it deploys to Iraq this fall.

I know I will return to the floor of the Senate to talk about the 
bravery and service of these men and women. But today I want to talk 
about the often unrecognized other half of these deployments--the 
military families that support the service members and keep things 
together at home. The spouses, sons, daughters, parents, grandparents 
and community supporters who work together and toil alone to pay the 
bills, get the kids to school, and help find employment while their 
loved ones are away.

May 8 is Military Families Appreciation Day in Oregon. On this 
special day, our State honors the dedication and service of military 
families and veterans who have helped make America's military the 
strongest the world has ever seen.

Being left behind when a loved one goes to war is not an easy 
mission. Yet our military families continue to make the difficult 
sacrifices, and call upon their inner reserves, to nurture family life 
so that their service member can focus on the business at hand.

Our military spouses are the glue that holds our military families 
together. They unselfishly give up their husband or wife, their partner 
and friend to help serve our Nation. They celebrate important events 
like birthdays, anniversaries, and sometimes a child's first step or 
first word alone. They assume the difficult role of being both mother 
and father--shouldering the responsibility of creating and nurturing a 
loving family environment when their loved one is away. Their strength 
and determination are examples to the rest of the country.

And to all of the grandparents and friends who step up when our 
single-parent service members are called to duty, I thank you. You 
unselfishly answer the Nation's call by caring for our future 
generation. You help relieve the pressures of military service by 
making sure our service members' children are safe, happy, and loved. 
Stand tall, stand proud. You, too, are our unsung heroes.

Finally, I would like to recognize the sons and daughters who grow up 
in a military family. As the children of America's defenders, they cope 
with unbelievable circumstances. The smells of shoe polish, starch, and 
Brasso may remind them of home more than the smells of cookies and 
apple pie. Their mothers and fathers are called to duty at a moment's 
notice, and they have no choice but to be strong, even when it hurts to 
say goodbye. Their contribution to the Nation and personal strength 
does not go unnoticed. They are our future and represent the best 
America has to offer.

Today's military family--spouses, sons, daughters, parents, 
grandparents and community--inspire us through spirit and strength. 
They proudly wave flags and keep the candles burning as a reminder of 
those who are gone.

Their dedication reminds us all that the U.S. flag is brilliant 
indeed; patriotic songs are not just reserved for the fourth of July; 
that a parting kiss can hold for months; and that shared tears can 
somehow bring us closer together. They put their own priorities aside. 
They take care of one another. They take care of America.

So to all military families, I thank you. Thank you for your service 
to your family, our community, and to our Nation.
