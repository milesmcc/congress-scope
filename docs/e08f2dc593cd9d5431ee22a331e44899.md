Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Staff Sergeant Alan 
Shaw of Little Rock, Arkansas, who died on February 9, 2007, fighting 
for our country in Iraq while supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. Alan 
Shaw was 31 years old when he selflessly gave his life for his country 
during combat operations.

After graduating from Wilbur D. Mills High School, Shaw attended 
Arkansas Tech University before enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps in 
1998. Shaw was assigned to the 1st Battalion 5th Marines in Camp 
Pendleton, California, where he served two overseas tours and one sea 
service tour before being honorably discharged in 2002. In October of 
2004, Shaw chose once again to nobly serve his country by joining the 
U.S. Army where he served two tours of duty in support of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, and it was in his second tour where he gave his life for 
our country.

Alan Shaw was proud to serve in the military and is remembered as an 
outstanding leader and friend to his fellow soldiers. Shaw had a 
passion for life and a vision for the future, and his personality 
sparked happiness in all those around him. His dedication to making the 
lives of those around him and the communities he lived in better could 
not have been greater.

Alan Shaw gave his life to serve our country and will forever be 
remembered as a hero, a father, a husband and a friend. My deepest 
condolences go out to his wife Sharrell; his three children Austin, 
Jourdan and Davyn; his parents Jarrell Bentley and Noramae Shaw of 
Little Rock; his siblings Larry and Lisa Shaw, Bud and Terri Bradley, 
Darren and Mindy Shaw, Randy and Angie Shaw, Amber Shaw and Jeffrey 
Shaw all of Little Rock; and to his nine nieces and nephews. He will be 
missed by his family, his community and all those who knew him and 
called him a friend. I will continue to keep Alan Shaw and his family 
in my deepest thoughts and prayers.
