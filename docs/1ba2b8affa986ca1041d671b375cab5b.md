Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Chairman Obey, for the time.

Today the Congressional Progressive Caucus held an event called 
''Winter Soldier.'' We listened to the veterans of the Iraq occupation, 
and they told us about what it's been like over there and what they've 
learned. The meeting actually followed in tradition of hearings first 
held during the Vietnam War. The forum gave veterans who have firsthand 
experience a chance to tell their stories. It was a solemn, thought-
provoking event. What these men and women saw, what they've 
experienced, is really heartbreaking.

But today we have it in our power, we have it in our power to put an 
end to the tragedy that is the Iraq war. Today, this Congress will 
decide if we will give the President a blank check to continue his 
endless occupation of Iraq, or if we will fund redeployment and 
reconciliation and if we will do something for the refugees in Iraq.

The American people have been clear in their demands. They want to 
end the occupation, not extend it. They want us to bring our troops and 
military contractors home. They want us to reaffirm our commitment to 
the Iraqi people.
