Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, the American people have a right to know 
or ask what's going on here. We have trillions of dollars for war, 
trillions of dollars for Wall Street, and trillions of dollars for 
health insurance companies; but now we hear we have less money for 
Social Security and less money for Medicare. Is there a connection?

We must begin restoring our Nation by restoring the peace. And we 
begin today when we defeat the supplemental appropriation that keeps us 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Democrats were elected on a promise to end the war in Iraq; we are 
continuing it. Democrats were elected to get us out of Afghanistan; the 
war is escalating. And to top it all off, Members of Congress, we have 
a rule, it's in the rule, which keeps Guantanamo open, keeps the 
prisoners there, despite the fact that many of them may have had their 
basic rights violated.

It's time for America to come home, start paying attention to 
creating jobs, health care, education, retirement security, investor 
security.

It's time for us to start paying attention here instead of running 
around the world trying to tell other people how to live.
