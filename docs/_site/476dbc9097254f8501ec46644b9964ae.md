Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this 
resolution, and I am in complete opposition to President's plan to send 
an additional 21,000 Americans into Iraq.

This ill conceived plan will only make a war that never should have 
started much, much worse. The generals don't want this surge. Our 
allies oppose it. 60 percent of the American people think it is a 
terrible idea and, the enemy is using it to boost recruitment. There is 
no conceivable reason for this surge. Yet, President Bush is pushing 
ahead with it.

I opposed the original Iraq war resolution because I didn't see the 
connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, the evidence of an 
immediate threat from Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, or even 
compelling evidence of the existence of WMD. But, we went in anyway. We 
rushed off, unprepared, into a needless war that has killed thousands 
and scarred 10's of thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of 
innocent Iraqis.

Now, here we go again. It is time for this administration to end its 
policy of ready, fire, aim. It is time to begin a policy of ready, aim, 
fire. I urge all of my colleagues to listen to the American public, to 
our troops and to our friends around the world. Vote yes on this 
resolution.
