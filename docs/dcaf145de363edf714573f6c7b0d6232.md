Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his leadership on behalf of 
family


farms. I will ask the Senator a couple of questions because he has been 
here a long time in Congress and we have served together for many 
years. I see Senator Conrad coming to the floor as well. The fact is--I 
want the Senator to let me know if he agrees with this--that the whole 
purpose of these emergency supplementals, if you look at the Web site 
that explains to people who want to know more about what we do on 
emergency supplementals, they have always been used--at least my 
research shows--is for emergencies, including especially natural 
disasters. Doesn't it strike the Senator as odd that the President of 
the United States would support $100 billion for the country of Iraq 
but tell us he doesn't support anything in this bill for the American 
people? Isn't that an odd thing?
