Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, it has come to my attention that Colonel 
Roger A. Wilson, Jr. is retiring as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
Kansas City District Commander. He has diligently served in this role 
for three years.

After earning degrees from The Citadel, the University of Colorado at 
Boulder, and the U.S. Army War College, Colonel Wilson went on to lead 
engineering battalions across the United States and around the world. 
In addition to these assignments, he served in combat operations in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan.

As Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City 
District, Colonel Wilson oversaw many military and civil works projects 
throughout the District. From overseeing construction projects at the 
region's many military installations to ensuring our levees and dams 
are structurally sound, Colonel Wilson ably led an office with diverse 
mandates and responsibilities. Although his resume boasts many 
accomplishments, Colonel Wilson's work to maintain the superiority of 
the Emergency Operations Center, which plays a vital role in responding 
to natural disasters whenever and wherever they may occur, is most 
impressive.

Madam Speaker, Colonel Wilson is a true professional and has 
exhibited remarkable leadership during his time as the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers Kansas City District Commander. I trust my fellow members 
of the House will join me in wishing him well in the days to come.
