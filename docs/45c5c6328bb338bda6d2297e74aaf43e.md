# THE 30 SOMETHING WORKING GROUP

`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 14 November 2007`

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I just want to make a point. It is not 
like we are out on a limb here. We just saw a poll that came out a few 
days ago from CNN that shows that seven in 10 Americans oppose this 
war. That is the highest number, 68 percent, 70 percent of Americans 
oppose this war, the highest number since the war began.



We are seeing almost by the week, by the day, new generals, new 
senior retired American military officials coming out and breaking with 
this President. We have already seen the Iraq Study Group, we have 
already seen dozens of foreign policy experts come out and plead with 
this President. Even many of his best friends, many of his father's 
advisors have pleaded for a new course.

The Democrats are on the side of the American public. The Democrats 
are on the side of the foreign policy community on Iraq. The Democrats 
are on the side of an increasing number of retired military generals 
and officials on this issue. As you said, there is just a very loyal, 
very recalcitrant block of Republicans who refuse to abide by the 
growing will of the American public on this issue. There will be a 
price to be paid for this.
