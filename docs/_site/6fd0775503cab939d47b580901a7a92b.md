Mr. BLUNT. Well, I sensed the sadness on those Friday opportunities 
to work in the district, and I'm glad we're working those out for our 
Members.

On the schedule next week, I'm wondering if we should anticipate any 
votes next week on Iraq. We voted today on an Iraq withdrawal bill that 
was introduced just 2 days ago. That bill wasn't noticed on last week's 
schedule. It didn't go through committee. It didn't have a hearing; 
didn't go into the Rules Committee until 1:30 on Wednesday, and I'm 
wondering if we're going to see anything like that on an Iraq bill next 
week.

I yield to my friend.
