Mr. HUNTER. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding briefly. I 
want to thank him for his statement and just clarify the record, while 
he has got some time, if I could.

Mr. Speaker, my good friend from California, the gentlelady, made the 
remark, as I understand it, that the Iraq Study Group did not agree 
with the President's so-called surge. I just would point to the 
statement that the Iraq Study Group published in their report. They 
said we could, however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of 
American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training 
and equipping mission if the U.S. commander in Iraq determines that 
such steps would be effective.

We also rejected the immediate withdrawal of our troops because we 
believe that so much is at stake. So the Iraq Study Group did state 
that they would support a surge to effect the stabilization of Baghdad, 
and it is in the nine sectors of Baghdad with Iraqi battalions to the 
front, American battalions backing them up, that this operation is 
taking right now. So it appears to me that the President is, in fact, 
following and is on common ground with this recommendation by the Iraq 
Study Group. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
