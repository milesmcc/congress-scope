`Mr. REID â€” 12 March 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of 
morning business with Senators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes 
each. There will be no rollcall votes today. The time is not divided by 
the majority or minority; people can come and speak whenever they 
choose.

I am hopeful today some of the remaining pending amendments to the
9/11 legislation can be disposed of by voice vote. If that is not the 
case, then 10 amendments remain in order for rollcall votes during 
tomorrow's session. Under an agreement entered into last week, once we 
have disposed of those amendments and the substitute, we will proceed 
to vote on passage of 
S. 4.

Members are on notice there will be a couple of rollcall votes in the 
morning prior to the Senate recessing for respective party conferences.

It is my intention to move to proceed to S.J. Res. 9, which is a 
joint resolution regarding Iraq, and I will file cloture on that motion 
hopefully tonight, setting up a cloture vote for Wednesday morning.
