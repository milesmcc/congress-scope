Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I wanted to take off on the point you just 
made about the ability we give for the President to make a decision 
that he thinks is in the national interest, of national security.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides benchmarks, the same 
benchmarks that this President came before the country and said were 
essential on January 10; that we have unit readiness; that we have a 
length of deployment.

We have two sets of benchmarks here. We have benchmarks that this 
Democratic Congress put in this legislation to make sure we can protect 
our troops, to make sure we weren't sending them into harm's way 
unprepared. Then we have benchmarks in this bill to ensure that the 
Iraqis meet their obligations. Those obligations, those benchmarks, are 
the same ones that the President indicated to the American people were 
essential when he spoke to the Nation on January 10.

When this Congress switched from Republican to Democrat after 
November 7, the main reason it happened is because the American people 
were sick and tired of being sick and tired. They had lost their 
confidence in their government. Their confidence in this Congress was 
badly shaken. We had scandals. We had a culture of corruption. We had a 
situation where the American people couldn't believe that their 
Congress was doing right on their behalf, and that the majority, 
Republican at the time, was here for the right reasons. That is why 
there was a wholesale shift and we won 33 seats on November 7.

We are exercising Congress's appropriate oversight role and 
reasserting the system of checks and balances that the Founding Fathers 
envisioned, particularly by putting language in this bill that ensures 
that units have to be ready. They have to be prepared. The chief of the 
military department concerned has to determine that a unit is fully 
mission capable before it is deployed to Iraq.

The reason that I wanted to interject during Mr. Meek's remarks is 
because you, Mr. Meek, mentioned that the President can certify to the 
Congress that sending a unit into harm's way in Iraq in spite of the 
fact that they are not fully mission capable would be in the national 
interest.

He is the commander-in-chief. There is no question that the President 
is the commander-in-chief. But it is our responsibility as Members of 
Congress that we look out for the American people, specifically and 
especially in this case our men and women in uniform who are going over 
to defend this country. We provide the funding to send them over. We 
provide the funding to ensure that they are fully equipped and 
prepared. And the President should have to come back to us and say in 
spite of the fact that this unit, these women and men are going over 
there unprepared and aren't fully mission capable, it still is in the 
national interest to send them. That is the least that he can do.

He can maintain his role as commander-in-chief in this legislation, 
but he has to make sure that he is doing right by our troops, and he 
has to own


up to what he is doing in this legislation, including in their length 
of deployment.

There is a Defense Department policy, Mr. Speaker, that requires the 
Department of Defense to abide by its current policy, which is that you 
shouldn't deploy a unit to Iraq or any region more than 365 days for 
the Army and more than 210 days for the Marines. The President in this 
legislation can waive that provision too, but he has to say that it is 
in the national interest to do so, to send troops on another tour with 
less than a year's rest, less than 210 days in the case of Marines.

Again, he has to actually say to that young man, whose 6-year-old boy 
I met, it is okay to miss half your son's life, because we need you, it 
is in the national interest, instead of being able to sort of duck and 
cover and do it in a clandestine way without the American people really 
knowing and without him owning up to it.

The same with time between deployments. It requires the Defense 
Department, besides length of deployment, the time between deployment 
is essential as well. The President can waive that provision, but he 
has to say to the Congress that it is in the national interests to do 
so.

We also have benchmarks related to the Iraqi people as well. By July 
1, 2007, the President has to certify that Iraq is making meaningful 
and substantial progress in meeting political and military benchmarks, 
including a militia disarmament program and a plan that equitably 
shares oil revenues among all Iraqis. After all, they are in the midst 
of civil war. They are killing each other over things like that.

The President has to certify there is progress being made. Otherwise, 
we are going to be there forever, with no end in sight, with no 
pressure on the Iraqi leadership to get the job done. Why would they 
feel the need to move in the direction of progress if they know that 
there is a never-ending, open-ended commitment for us to be there and 
for the money to keep flowing.



They also have to achieve political and military benchmarks. By 
October 1, 2007, the President has to certify that Iraqis have achieved 
political and military benchmarks, and if he doesn't provide that 
certification, then U.S. forces will begin immediate deployment 
completed by March 2008. There are steps toward progress that the Iraqi 
leadership must take or we are not going to continue to put our men and 
women in harm's way, and we shouldn't.

And, finally, we need to eventually end our participation in this 
war. Our commitment there should be finite, not open-ended. The 
President should not have a blank check, and this legislation that we 
passed today ensures that.

I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.
