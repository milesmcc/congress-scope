`Mr. GOHMERT â€” 1 August 2007`

---


Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I received a letter from a mother of a 
Marine who was killed on July 5 of this year. She asked that I make 
this letter known to the Members of the House, and that is what I will 
do at this time. I will read directly from her letter.

''Let me first tell you about myself. My name is Jenifer Allbaugh, my 
husband is Jon Allbaugh and we have three children together. My son, 
2nd Lt. Army Jason Allbaugh (24), my daughter Alicia Allbaugh, college 
sophomore (19) and Cpl. Jeremy Allbaugh, USMC (21). Jeremy was killed 
in Iraq on July 5, 2007 while on a mission in a Humvee that was hit by 
an IED.

''Jeremy enlisted in the Marine Corps before he graduated from high 
school in 2004. We were at war but he very much wanted to serve his 
country. He believed very much in what he was doing and what his 
country was trying to accomplish in Iraq and Afghanistan.

''While we as a family are struggling greatly with the loss of our 
hero, I feel a great need to express my concerns in regards to our 
military.

''I do not understand why our government has to be pushed to equip 
our


military with the best equipment technology has to offer. We are one of 
the greatest Nations on this earth, but yet it took parents and other 
individuals to get our military up-armored Humvees and better body 
armor. Now we need Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles and the 
debate is on again.

''First of all, these vehicles were available for years before this 
war began, but yet we are just now realizing the need for them. This is 
shameful, and there is no excuse for it. I would like one person to 
look me and other mothers in the eye and explain why our sons were not 
in the these vehicles. According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, 
approximately 700 American heroes would be alive today if they had been 
in an MRAP, my son included.

''I'm not smartest or most educated woman in the world, but it 
doesn't take a genius to figure out that there should be no debate over 
supplying our military with these vehicles.

''IEDs seem to be one of the most effective weapons terrorists have 
against our troops. Money should not be an issue. This country has been 
selfish long enough. It shouldn't matter how much it costs. If you are 
going to ask our military to put their lives on the line for our 
freedoms, then again, money should not matter. We as a country can go 
without perfectly paved roads and other such luxuries we seem to think 
we need for awhile. We gripe about the cost of gas, milk and cup of 
coffee. If Americans would quit being selfish, maybe funding this war 
wouldn't be so hard.

''Our Congress and Senate need to stop the finger pointing, back 
biting, back stabbing and name calling and do their jobs. Work 
together. As hard as that sounds, the rest of us in the 'real world' 
have to do it every day.

''It is also time for what I believe is a silent majority to stand up 
and be heard. Since the death of our son, we have heard from people all 
over the country who appreciate what he did for his country. They also 
appreciate what our military is doing in Iraq and Afghanistan. But we 
as a country only hear from the ones who complain the most. The rich 
and famous, who don't know what they're talking about, get to tell 
their opinions, but not those of us who support our sons and daughters 
who have volunteered to serve this country.


''I had long conversations with my son while he was in Iraq. I was 
one of the lucky Moms who got to talk to her son quite frequently. He 
told me of the good things they were doing, for example opening 
schools, hospitals, clinics and helping recruit men into the Iraqi 
Army. The vast majority of the Iraqi people in the area Jeremy was in, 
loved and appreciated the Marines. They understood why we are there. He 
told me how the locals were voluntarily giving info on the terrorists 
and their activities and that neighborhood watch programs had been 
started.

''Do we hear of this? No. Because it isn't sensational enough and it 
doesn't get votes.

''This war has had a lot of mistakes made, but to me it's neither 
here or there. We are there and there are good things being done. I 
want no more excuses and explanations. Write the check with no 
attachments and give our men what they need. MRAP's should have been 
there from the beginning and should be there now. Secretary of Defense 
Robert Gates is asking for more money for MRAP's. This is a no brainer 
and there should no excuse for thousands to be built. I as a Mother do 
not care what the obstacles are. We built ships faster than this during 
World War II. It can be done if we want to. Don't attach pork and other 
stupid stuff to it either. Just do it. Until we finish our job in Iraq 
and Afghanistan these vehicles shouldn't be under debate and should be 
top priority in the manufacturing industry. If you had done this in the 
first place, my son and many others would be alive today. He was in a 
Humvee every day he was in Iraq as are thousands of others.

''Jeremy was a bigger man at 21 than any of the men and women that 
are running this country. He went to war without hesitation or 
reservation. He did his job well and was sorely overworked and 
underpaid. I ask that you all start earning your paycheck and do what 
is right. As my son said, 'We are doing good things here and we need to 
finish.''

Please honor our military and give them the equipment and time in 
Iraq and Afghanistan that they need. Please save another Soldier or 
Marine in a Humvee by putting them in MRAP's.

''The Iraqi people where my son was appreciated him and his fellow 
Marines. Too bad our own politicians don't. Quit using words of support 
and do it with deeds.''

I realize my time is expired, and I thank the Speaker.
