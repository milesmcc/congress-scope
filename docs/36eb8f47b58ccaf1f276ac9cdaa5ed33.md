Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time.

And with just a minute or two of time, one of the saddest moments, 
one of the two saddest moments in my relatively brief career here in 
the United States House was when this Chamber acted at the President's 
request to cut $12 billion from college financial aid. That occurred 
the day after a State of the Union Address where the President talked 
about American competitiveness.

Today, we take a bold step in rectifying that error. And I just want 
to refer a moment to the other saddest day of my thus far 8 years in 
the House of Representatives, and that was the decision in this Chamber 
to go to war in Iraq.

Those were the two saddest moments in my congressional career: Begin 
a war in error, and now perpetuating a pride. But at least today, at 
this moment, we are having an opportunity to rectify, in my view, the 
other great error that we committed during my time in this Chamber, and 
that is the $12 billion cut that the Education Committee passed, the 
prior majority passed in this Chamber, and that went into effect 
without a necessary 60-vote majority in the Senate.

Now, we can propose this greatest increase in college financial aid. 
We may or may not have the votes for cloture in the other Chamber, but 
this is the right thing to do. This is the right thing to do. It will 
make America more competitive. It will help individuals, and it will 
help our society, and we will rectify the errors we have made in the 
past one by one.

I rise in support of the College Cost Reduction Act.

Affordable access to quality post-secondary education is the best 
tool available to ensure success and the kind of career that can 
support a family. It is also critical that American students have the 
education that will help them remain competitive in an increasingly 
global and knowledge-based economy.

The College Cost Reduction Act provides a major funding increase to 
assist students and their families achieve the goal paying for college, 
and much more--at no new expense to taxpayers. It provides tuition 
assistance to undergraduates who commit to teaching in low-income 
communities or high-need subject areas. It rewards those who serve 
their communities--first responders and law enforcement officers, for 
example, by providing loan forgiveness to those that serve others.

Perhaps most importantly, the bill provides a major help to students 
in my home state of Oregon. The bill expands Pell Grant eligibility, 
and the maximum Pell Grant scholarship is increased over $500. This 
means nearly 70,000 Oregonians could benefit from the bill. This 
translates into $194 million dollars in aid to Oregon students and 
families over five years.

College costs have skyrocketed over the past decade.

The College Cost Reduction Act is instrumental in helping more 
Americans achieve their dream of a college education. I strongly 
support this bill, and urge my colleagues to do so as well.
