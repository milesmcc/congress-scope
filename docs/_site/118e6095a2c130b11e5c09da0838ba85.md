Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 20 seconds.

I would also observe that our soldiers don't have the power to 
require Iraqi politicians to quit killing each other and make the 
diplomatic and political compromises necessary to end this civil war. 
Only Iraqi politicians have that, and we are trying to send them a 
message with this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Andrews).

(Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
