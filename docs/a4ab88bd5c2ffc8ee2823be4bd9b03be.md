`Mr. HODES â€” 28 June 2007`

Mr. HODES. Mr. Kline, thank you very much for those thoughts. I 
expect that over this July 4th recess, a number of our colleagues, 
especially those on the other side of the aisle, will probably be 
hearing from their constituents about their concerns about the current 
course in Iraq, the failure of this administration's strategy, with the 
surge and the way things have been handled, the numerous mistakes, both 
strategic and implementation and in conception have deeply, deeply hurt 
us.

I know the American people, as we are here in Congress, especially in 
discussions with Democratic Members on the Armed Services Committee, 
are deeply concerned that American readiness, that our readiness to 
deal with other conflicts that may arise, not be jeopardized, and we 
are going to take important steps and have taken important steps to 
improve the readiness that has been hurt by these deployments in Iraq.

At some point we are going to talk a little bit more about what it 
has meant for our veterans, but we have been joined by another 
distinguished colleague who I would like to introduce. Joe Sestak, a 
member of the class of 2006 from Pennsylvania, came to this Congress 
with an extraordinarily distinguished career, serving our country in 
the military in the Navy.

He is a gentleman who understands military, military matters, 
military operations. He is deeply committed to American strategic 
interests and is in the forefront of those in the Democratic Caucus who 
are intent on seeing a new direction in Iraq.

I would like to now turn it over to you, Joe Sestak.
