`Mr. REID â€” 18 December 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a short time we will move to vote on 
three amendments to the Omnibus appropriations bill.

Each of them takes a different approach to funding the war in Iraq.

I will vote for the Feingold/Reid amendment, which I have cosponsored 
and voted for several times this year.

Feingold/Reid is the right approach to begin to responsibly end the 
war, and I will vote for it again today.

The second amendment is Levin/Reed, which I will also vote for.

Finally, we will vote on the McConnell amendment, which I will 
strongly vote against. This amendment simply does more of what 
congressional Republicans have done since the war began:

It rubberstamps President Bush's reckless management of the war that 
has cost us so dearly in lives, limbs, and treasure.

The debate over supplemental war funding is nothing new.

Every year, President Bush comes to us demanding more and more funds 
for Iraq, with absolutely no accountability. This year, he requested a 
staggering $200 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.

At a time when he and his allies in Congress are telling us we can't 
invest in medical research, education, infrastructure, or public 
safety, they want billions and billions more for Iraq.

How will our country pay the bill for the Iraq war? A Cost that when 
all is done will likely exceed $2 trillion?

The President has no idea. He has no plan or intention to pay the 
bill. He is simply sticking it in a drawer like an overdue credit card 
statement, leaving it to our children and grandchildren to pay for 
generations to come.

That is not just fiscal irresponsibility, it is fiscal madness. But 
it is par for the course for a President who inherited record budget 
surpluses from President Clinton and turned them into record deficits.

Every year, this war gets more expensive, and the American people 
deserve to know why.

The answer is waste. The answer is fraud. The answer is 
mismanagement. The answer is incompetence.

On President Bush's watch, the companies he chooses to do business 
with--like Halliburton and Blackwater--have wasted billions and 
billions of our tax dollars.

The President has allowed billions to be spent on buildings that were 
never built, projects that were never seen through, and contractor 
military operations that did far more harm than good.

That is why he asks for more every year--because he has grossly 
misspent the funds he has received.



This year, we have already passed a $460 billion Defense budget--and 
this bill includes another $31 billion for Afghanistan and troop 
protection.

Democrats have fully funded the needs of our men and women in uniform 
and given the President more than enough to conduct the war and begin 
to bring our troops home.

But one thing we can't control is his reckless financial 
mismanagement.

We have held hearings and brought cases of waste and fraud to the 
light of day.

But ultimately, the inability to conduct the war with the billions 
already allocated is no one's fault but his.

The President and his allies here in Congress will doubtlessly push 
the panic button and say that if we don't approve the funds 
immediately, our troops will suffer.

This argument is untruthful and beyond the pale.

Our Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates--a man for whom I have great 
respect--told Congress that the Army has enough money to get through 
the end of February and the Marines have enough funds to get through 
mid-March.

If President Bush hadn't wasted untold billions, our troops would be 
funded for far longer than that.

If the President had followed the wishes of the American people by 
spending the funds we gave him to wind down the war instead of ramp it 
up, the existing funds would be more than sufficient.

But he didn't. He ignored the calls of the American people to 
responsibly end the war. And he should accept the consequences of his 
mistakes by finally changing course.

But let me be clear: Democrats will never let our troops suffer for 
the President's misdeeds.

Democrats always have and always will support our courageous men and 
women in uniform who have given so much and received so little in 
return.

It is Democrats who insisted upon a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay 
increase for everyone in uniform, which the President opposed.

It is Democrats who made right the awful conditions at Walter Reed 
and other veterans' health care facilities that took place on this 
President's watch.

It is Democrats who provided a $3.5 billion increase for veterans' 
health care after Republicans underfunded it for years.

It is Democrats who passed the Wounded Warriors Act to honor our 
servicemembers and their families.

I think we have heard enough of the tired old Bush-Republican scare 
tactics that Democrats are putting our troops at risk.

The facts speak for themselves.

We have always stood with our men and women in uniform. We always 
will.

But unlike Republicans, we believe that truly supporting our troops 
means beginning to bring them home to the hero's welcome they have so 
bravely earned.

My fellow Democrats and I come to the Senate floor more times than I 
can count to discuss the horrible cost of the Iraq war on our troops, 
our national security, and our reputation in the world.

We have lost nearly 4,000 young Americans. Tens of thousands more 
have been gravely wounded.

As I have said already, hundreds of billions of dollars have been 
spent--tens of billions have been recklessly wasted--and the total 
price will climb into the trillions before all is said and done.

Our military has been stretched paper thin. Colin Powell has said our 
Armed Forces are ''about broken.''

Every single one of our available combat units is deployed to either 
Iraq or Afghanistan, leaving no strategic reserves for other conflicts.

And as the situation in Iran, the faltering of democracy in Pakistan, 
and the escalating violence in Afghanistan show, the world can evolve 
literally overnight.

We must have the flexibility to respond, but right now we do not.

Our troops are being forced into repeated deployments, and the length 
of those deployments has gotten longer.

Military families are deeply strained, military mental health is 
suffering, and the Armed Forces are reporting problems with both 
recruitment and retention.

Just this week, General Casey acknowledged this problem, saying--''We 
are running the all-volunteer force at a pace that is not 
sustainable.''

Our National Guard is hamstrung in its efforts to keep us safe at 
home, because much of their equipment has been shipped to Iraq. Every 
natural disaster, from fire to flood, reminds us of this growing 
crisis.

Yet for all the cost and all the courage of our troops, this war has 
made us no safer.

Let me remind my colleagues of the most recent National Intelligence 
Estimate, which found that al-Qaida has regrouped and is now directing 
operations from Pakistan, stronger than ever.

Bin Laden remains free, taunting and threatening us with new videos.

Afghanistan--once viewed as a great military success--has spiraled 
out of control.

The opium trade there is at an all-time high, violence is at its 
highest level since American intervention, and recent reports indicate 
that the Taliban has vastly stepped up its efforts.

It is no wonder that this week has brought new reports that a 
panicked Bush administration is conducting a top-to-bottom review to 
stave off all-out chaos in Afghanistan and the backslide of all past 
gains.

I welcome this review. But as long as more than 160,000 troops remain 
caught in the crossfire of the Iraqi civil war, our ability to address 
conditions in Afghanistan--and elsewhere--will be constrained.

The American people are rightly frustrated that more has not been 
done to responsibly end the Iraqi war.

I share that frustration.

But within the confines of a stubborn, obstinate President and a 
Republican Congress that knows no other way but to carry his water, 
Democrats have made a difference--and a majority of Senators have 
consistently voted with us.

Before Democrats controlled the Congress, the Bush White House 
conducted the war with total impunity.

No dissent was tolerated. The patriotism of those who raised 
questions was openly attacked.

This year, Democrats have brought the President's recklessness into 
the harsh light of day.

We forced the President to set benchmarks for legislative and 
political progress and required regular reports on whether those 
benchmarks were being met.

These reports have shown that the surge has failed to reach the 
objective set forth by the President of political reconciliation.

We forced General Petraeus to testify--and he has said repeatedly 
that the war cannot be won militarily and must be won politically.

We brought to light the Blackwater controversy and forced Eric Prince 
to testify.

And we put an end to the duplicitous Republican practice of claiming 
to support the troops but failing to protect them in the field or 
provide for them back home.

Do I feel that enough has been done? Of course not.

Time after time, the Republican minority has had a choice: stand with 
the President or stand with the American people.

Each and every time, they have chosen the President.

I urge my colleagues to reject the McConnell amendment. The time for 
zero accountability is long past.

I urge my colleagues to embrace the amendments offered by Senator 
Feingold and Senator Levin.

Let's send our troops and all Americans a holiday gift: a message 
that the United States Congress is ready to bring this war, now nearly 
5 years long, to its responsible end.
