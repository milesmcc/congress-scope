`Mr. BLUMENAUER â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Skelton, Mr. Abercrombie and Mr. 
Tanner, for bringing this forward. It's important not just for what 
you're doing, but for what this represents, to be able to get the 
debate going here on the floor and to expand it.

This resolution represents the lowest common denominator, I think, 
but it's important for us to expand it, to deal with budget 
accountability. I personally don't want to have one more dime for 
waging war but, rather, move it forward in terms of securing the peace.

I want to stop the open-ended commitment, hopefully revisiting the 
terms of the authority, move legislation to deal with the poor souls 
who are trapped in Iraq, refugees who relied on the United States and 
we've turned our back on them. Let's have some added accountability for 
the outsourcing of the war through private contractors, and certainly 
stop the drumbeat of war for Iran. I hope this will be the first of 
many debates on specifics every week, hopefully every day.

I appreciate, Mr. Skelton, what you have done. There is no one who 
cares more deeply about our troops. There is nobody who has tried to 
sound the alarm about these disastrous policies. I hope we can work 
with you to expand this debate, to increase the accountability so that 
ultimately we achieve peace in Iraq.
