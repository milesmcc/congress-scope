`Mr. WESTMORELAND â€” 24 July 2008`

---


Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.

I wanted to have a quote up here that was from Mr. Kanjorski. And 
this was in an interview that he was giving to one of the local 
newspapers or television stations. And he was talking about really the 
Democrats' promise to end the war in Iraq and bringing all of the 
troops home, but it relates to their energy policy, too, and what they 
promised when Speaker Pelosi, then-minority leader in April of 2006, 
says, ''We as Democrats have a commonsense plan to lower the 
skyrocketing price of gas.'' At the time it was about $2.10 a gallon.

But Mr. Kanjorski said, ''We sort of stretched the truth and people 
ate it up.'' Well, there's been some truth stretching going on lately 
in this building, and I think what we've got to realize is that we need 
to do something to increase the supply other than taking out of our 
savings account.

If you have a shortfall every month and you take out of your savings 
to make up for that shortfall or to increase the supply of money that 
you have, you're eventually going to run out of that. We would run out 
of oil, and we don't need to do that because then we would certainly be 
at the mercy of our enemies.

This is Mr. DeFazio back on January 18 of 2007, Mr. Speaker, when the 
Democrats came out with their energy plan. He said, ''It is sad to see 
the Republicans come to this. Now they laughingly say this will lead 
the higher prices.'' At the time, gas was $2.10 a gallon. Today it's 
about $4.10 a gallon.

We told the Democrats then that their energy plan was not going to 
work, that it was not going to help Americans lower the gas prices and 
the price to heat their homes. We're telling them the same thing today: 
by taking out of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply 
is not the way to go. That's not the commonsense plan that Speaker 
Pelosi promised us back in April of 2006.

We don't need to deplete our savings, the energy reserve that we have 
in cases of emergency like when we used it for the first Gulf war and 
when we used it for Katrina. We don't need to use our savings.

And so with that, I want to say that this is another situation where, 
Mr. Speaker, the American people have heard the Republican idea of 
increasing supply, an all-of-the-above policy, and the Democrats are 
still doing things under suspension when they could do this under 
regular rule. They've got 218 votes. Mr. Speaker, the reason I think 
the majority party does not want to do it is because they know their 
energy plan is a failure. They want these bills to fail that they have 
under suspension.

Let's bring about something to this floor that will let the duly 
elected people of this country vote on an energy policy that will bring 
relief to the Americans at the pump. And that policy is to increase our 
oil supply from our own natural resources.
