## `a6f259b2190581f97cbb2f7f135534a8`
`Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I just would like to correct 
something. We are not occupying Iraq. We are helping the Iraqi 
government, who has complete control over there trying to win this 
battle.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to our new representative from 
Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).

(Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
