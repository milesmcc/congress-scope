Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I would like to speak about the failure 
of the counterinsurgency strategy.

The Brookings Institution recently reported that, in terms of raw 
violence, the situation is at an historic worst level with early 2010 
levels of various types of attacks much higher than even last year at 
this time. Much of that is due to the recent Marjah campaign and, more 
generally, to the deployment of additional U.S. and Afghan troops to 
parts of the country where they have not been present before.

The President has called this war a just war. The framing of war as 
''just'' is served to legitimize the slaughter of innocent civilians in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

A 200-page report by the RAND Corporation is entitled, 
''Counterintelligence in Afghanistan Deals a Huge Blow to our Ideas of 
Counterinsurgency.'' It reads: In many cases, a significant direct 
intervention by U.S. military forces may undermine popular support and 
legitimacy. The United States is also unlikely to remain for the 
duration of most insurgencies. This study's assessment of 90 
insurgencies indicates that it takes an average of 14 years to defeat 
insurgents once an insurgency develops. Occupations fuel insurgencies. 
In other words, this assessment does not fit into the President's 
supposed rapid increase and the shaky plan to withdraw by the summer of 
2011.

The Brookings report continues: Second, the United States and other 
international actors need to improve the quality of local governance, 
especially in rural areas of Afghanistan. Field research in the east 
and south show that development and reconstruction did not reach most 
rural areas because of the deteriorating security environment. Even the 
provincial reconstruction teams, which were specifically designed to 
assist in the development of reconstruction projects, operate inside 
pockets in east and south because of security concerns.

NGOs and State agencies, such as USAID and the Canadian International 
Development Agency, were also not involved in the reconstruction and 
development in many areas of the south and east.

The irony of this situation is that rural areas which were at most 
risk from the Taliban, which were unhappy with the slow pace of change, 
a population with the greatest unhappiness, received little assistance. 
The counterinsurgency in Afghanistan will be won or lost in the local 
communities of rural Afghanistan, not in urban centers such as Kabul, 
says the Brookings Institution.

Now, someone I'm not used to quoting, conservative columnist George 
Will, wrote in The Washington Post that the counterinsurgency theory 
concerning the time and level of forces required to protect the 
population indicates that, nationwide, Afghanistan would need hundreds 
of thousands of coalition troops, perhaps, for a decade or more. That 
is inconceivable.

For how long are we willing to dedicate billions of dollars and 
thousands of lives before we realize that we can't win Afghanistan 
militarily? Our biggest mistake in the Afghanistan strategy is to think 
that we can separate the Taliban from the rest of the population. We 
cannot. The Taliban is a local resistance movement that is part and 
parcel of an indigenous population. We lost Vietnam because we failed 
to win the hearts and minds of local populations without providing them 
with a competent government that provided them with basic security and 
with a decent living. That message can and should be applied to 
Afghanistan.

The strategy for winning Afghanistan is simple: Stop killing the 
people and they will stop killing you.
