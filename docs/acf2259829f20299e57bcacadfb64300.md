Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, President Bush has called for more money, 
more patience, and a renewed commitment of U.S. troops in Iraq for the 
foreseeable future. The American people should not be fooled. This is 
nothing more than another stay-the-course strategy that puts us on a 
path for 10 years of war in Iraq.

Under the Bush plan, about 5,700 troops, or about 3.5 percent, of the 
American forces in Iraq would come home later this year. That's it. The 
rest of our troops would remain in Iraq until at least next summer. The 
President anticipates that at least 130,000 American men and women 
would remain in Iraq indefinitely for many years to come.

The President's plan for Iraq amounts to an open-ended and dangerous 
commitment of American troops in Iraq, and an open wallet for the 
American people to pay.

Mr. Speaker, this is not a plan for success in Iraq, nor is it a plan 
that will make America safer. It is time for my Republican colleagues 
to stand up to this President and say enough is enough. Democrats will 
continue to demand change because it is time that we


begin a responsible redeployment out of Iraq.
