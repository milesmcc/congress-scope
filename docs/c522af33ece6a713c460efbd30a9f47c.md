# ORDER OF PROCEDURE
## `c522af33ece6a713c460efbd30a9f47c`
`Mr. REID â€” 30 January 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I said at a meeting with the press earlier 
today how much I appreciate the Republicans supporting cloture on this 
minimum wage bill. I hope we are going to have a good bipartisan vote 
on this bill. There is no question in my mind we will. We have done 
ethics reform. We are going to do the minimum wage and then move on to 
something else. I hope we can work on a bipartisan basis.

Mr. President, as you know, we have debate on Iraq coming up when we 
finish this bill. We are trying to figure out exactly what we are going 
to be debating because it is a moving target on both sides. We hope to 
get that done.

I want the record to reflect that I think we are making good 
progress, and we are doing some legislating. That is very important to 
the Senate and the country.
