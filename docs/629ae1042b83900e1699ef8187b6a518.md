Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I strongly support House Resolution 1069, which addresses and 
condemns the spread of encouragement to violence against America and 
Americans by Middle East-based media outlets. This is not a problem in 
theory, Mr. Speaker. When TV channels broadcast attacks by insurgents 
on U.S. soldiers in Iraq or newspapers publish repeated calls for the 
destruction of the United States, they further endanger the security of 
American civilians and military personnel in the Middle East. These 
channels are then broadcast on satellite providers that transmit not 
only to the region, but as far away as Europe, Asia, Africa and even 
North America.



We must do everything we can to prevent our enemies from recruiting 
potential insurgents and homicidal bombers. They must be prevented, 
from Beirut to London to New York, who seek to shed American blood 
wherever and whenever they wish.

Media outlets that provide financial, material, or technological 
support to violent Islamic groups should be held accountable for their 
hate speech that incites murder of American civilians and military. 
Given that recipients of U.S. aid, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, 
control many of the satellite providers that transmit such incitement, 
we should use our leverage to urge these nations to act responsibly and 
stop putting these calls for murder on the air of their television 
stations.

I again rise in very strong support of H. Res. 1069, and I urge my 
fellow members to do as well.

I reserve the balance of my time.
