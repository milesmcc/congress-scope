Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this supplemental 
funding bill which will for the first time assert the will of Congress 
and the American people to change the President's failed plan of ''Stay 
the Course.'' For far too long, the President has ignored the will of 
the American public. In passing this bill, we will send a message to 
the President that this is no longer acceptable.

This legislation includes meaningful benchmarks and deadlines that 
provide the Iraqis with incentives to take responsibility for their own 
security and makes way for the return of our troops. The bill also 
requires the Iraqi government to take meaningful steps towards national 
reconciliation by distributing oil revenues fairly, providing 
opportunities to the Sunni minority, and amending the constitution to 
discourage further fragmentation.

We can no longer afford to give the President a blank check for the 
war in Iraq. There are thousands of brave men and women deployed 
overseas in harm's way right now who are depending on us. We need to 
put Iraqis up front, so that we can remove Americans from the front 
lines. This legislation will encourage the Iraqis to stand up and be 
accountable for the security of their country. I urge my colleagues to 
support this emergency supplemental funding bill.
