Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in conclusion, again, there is a simple 
answer to our problems in Iraq, which is mission change. We can both 
support the troops and change the mission. That is what the American 
people want. That is what the experts tell us. I believe that is what 
most of our soldiers want. I urge support of this supplemental and 
again urge the President to reconsider and sign it.

I yield the floor.
