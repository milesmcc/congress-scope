Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican whip for yielding.

On Monday the House will meet at 12:30 for morning hour and 2 p.m. 
for legislative business. We will consider several bills under 
suspension of the rules. There will be no votes before 6:30 p.m. as is 
our practice.

On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning hour, and at 10 
a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House 
will meet at 10 a.m., and on Friday the House will meet at 9 a.m.

In addition to further suspension bills, a complete list of those 
bills for the week will be announced later this week, we will consider 
a small business tax relief bill, and a resolution regarding the war in 
Iraq.

Because we intend to make sure that every Member who wishes to speak 
to that matter will have the opportunity to do so, Members should be 
advised that we will have long days next week, meaning perhaps as late 
as midnight, and Friday could be a full day in order to complete our 
work for the week.
