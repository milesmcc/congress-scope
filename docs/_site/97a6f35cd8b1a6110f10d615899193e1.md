Mr. McNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to salute and pay 
tribute to the memory of Marine Sergeant Shawn Martin, who gave his 
life in service to his country in Iraq. He died on June 20. His funeral 
will be on Thursday morning.

Sergeant Martin's death is a reminder to all of us that, regardless 
of how we feel about this particular war, that young men and women 
across our country put on the uniform of the United States military and 
are willing to go anywhere in the world at the direction of our 
government to protect American interests.

It reminds me not to let even a single day go by without remembering 
with deepest gratitude all of those who, like my own brother, Bill, 
made the supreme sacrifice, all those like Shawn who made the supreme 
sacrifice, and all of those who serve in the military with great honor 
and then come back home, render outstanding service in the community 
and raise beautiful families to carry on their fine traditions. These 
are the things that I'm most grateful for today as a citizen of the 
United States of America.

So today I extend my deepest sympathies to Shawn's wife, to his 
parents, to all the members of his family for his tremendous service to 
our country for making the supreme sacrifice, and we shall never forget 
this true American hero.
