Mr. KAGEN. It does not have to be that way. With the money we have 
already spent in Iraq, we could immunize every human on Earth with 
every vaccine that we know about for the next 95 years. We could have 
sent 14 million children, our children, to a college education. We 
could have built over 100, maybe 150, hospitals in each and every State 
in the Union. There is a lot we could be doing with the money we are 
spending overseas in Iraq, and it is all about values, and it is all 
about choices, and we are really getting to a tipping point, I believe, 
not just in our economy, but people feel it in their gut that we are 
headed in the wrong direction still, even though the difference makers, 
the three of us that just got the opportunity to serve here in 
Congress, have arrived.
