Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, when the Democratic Congress was elected 
last November, we pledged to enact measures to protect and support our 
military troops and veterans. Since taking office, we have honored that 
promise by passing important legislation.

This year, the House has passed the largest increase for veterans 
health care in the history of the Veterans Administration, has made 
major improvements in equipment and training, including protecting the 
mine resistant ambush protected vehicles that reduce the strain on our 
servicemen and women and protect them in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Today, we continue that commitment by passing the Defense 
authorization conference report, which includes a much-needed 3.5 
percent pay increase for our troops, improves military health care, and 
requires a report on the current state of readiness for our forces, 
which are stretched very thin.

Madam Speaker, this Congress has a proud record this year of 
supporting our troops and veterans. I hope all of our colleagues will 
join in continuing these efforts by supporting the Department of 
Defense authorization conference report.

On Veterans Day and Memorial Day, we honor those who have served and 
given their lives. This vote today honors those who serve us every day. 
I urge the President to sign this legislation once it has passed the 
Congress.
