Ms. LEE. Let me just remind you that nearly 5,000 American troops and 
countless Iraqi civilians have died, more than 30,000 Americans are 
wounded, and more than 4 million Iraqis are displaced.

As the proud daughter of a career military officer, my dad died last 
September, and, let me tell you, he wanted us out of Iraq, I salute and 
I honor our troops. I believe the best way to support and honor our 
troops is by bringing them home, and we should provide funds to bring 
them home, to provide for their economic security, their health and 
their mental health needs when they come home.
