`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 11 September 2008`

---


Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I would like submit the 
following editorial published today in the Times and Democrat newspaper 
of Orangeburg, South Carolina on September 11, 2008. It eloquently 
conveys the dedication we all feel on this seventh anniversary of the 
terrorist attacks of September 11th. I appreciate their sentiment, and 
believe that we must never forget those who lost their lives on that 
terrible day, never forget the enemy we face, and never lose faith that 
our nation will prevail in this Global War on Terrorism.








 Seven Years Later: ''We will not forget''




 Today is Sept. 11, 2008, seven years after the worst attack 


 against America in its history. Second District Congressman 


 Joe Wilson has since that day made a point of referencing 


 remembering 9-11 in every speech before lawmakers. He's 


 offered more than words, too, with his children serving in 


 the war on terrorism and the congressman being an active 


 supporter of the war and the military waging it.



 The Times and Democrat's continuing series of memorial 


 posters today focuses on 


 9-11. ''We will not forget.'' The message has not changed.



 Innocent people in the World Trade Centers and the 


 Pentagon, and aboard an airliner in Pennsylvania, died when 


 terrorists brought their hatred for our nation and its people 


 to our shores. The images of airliners crashing into the very 


 symbols of our Nation are forever etched into Americans' 


 minds.



 On this anniversary date, our Nation remains under attack. 


 We continue to be the target of terrorists, either directly 


 or through attacks on our allies. Extremists contending they 


 are acting in the name of Islam continually vow to punish our 


 nation for its perceived evil role around the world.



 Defeating the threat, on the surface, appears impossible. 


 We cannot score definitive military victories against forces 


 that are committed only to recruiting soldiers to die while 


 killing as many Americans as possible. There seemingly always 


 will be another recruit.



 Our forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan face constant 


 threats. Our enemies boast of killing the American invaders 


 who have come to seize holy lands. Thousands have died. Their 


 deaths must not be in vain. The sacrifices of the thousands 


 on Sept. 11, 2001, must not be forgotten. Our nation will 


 stand tall, we will determine where and how to continue the 


 fight against terrorism. Just as older generations passed the 


 test in World War II and wars before, the generations of our 


 time are facing their tests. We cannot afford to fail.
