Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, after 4 years, billions of dollars and 
thousands of lives lost, we simply cannot reward failure with a blank 
check in the war in Iraq. I refuse to rubber-stamp more failed 
policies.

In the weeks ahead, we have the opportunity as representatives of the 
people to change the direction in Iraq without jeopardizing the safety 
and well-being of our troops. We must finally require Iraqis to take 
control of their own country and their own destiny.

The President has threatened to veto legislation that contains his 
own benchmarks for success in Iraq; provides our troops with the 
training and equipment they need; and ensures that when our brave 
soldiers return home, they get the kind of care that they deserve. Our 
legislation also commits additional funds to fight the forgotten war in 
Afghanistan and against al Qaeda, strengthening our national security.

Mr. Speaker, the people of New York's 24th District sent me here to 
address the war in Iraq and to start this country on a long overdue new 
direction for America.
