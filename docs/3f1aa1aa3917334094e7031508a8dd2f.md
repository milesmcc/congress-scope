Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 793, the 
Reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act. S. 793 is the Senate 
companion to H.R. 1418, a bill that I cosponsored to amend the Public 
Health Service Act to reauthorize and improve our efforts to combat and 
treat traumatic brain injury, TBI, at the Federal and State levels. As 
a member of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, this issue is 
near and dear to my heart, and I am proud that we are debating this 
important legislation today.

Of troops wounded in Iraq 62 percent have sustained TBI, compared to 
a rate closer to 20 percent in previous conflicts. Overall in the U.S., 
there are about 1.5 million civilian cases of traumatic brain injury 
each year. I have worked hard to make researching and fighting TBI a 
priority and, in particular, the relationship between TBI and epilepsy.

Traumatic brain injury, TBI, causes epilepsy in up to 30 percent of 
civilians and 50 percent of military head injuries, greatly 
exacerbating chronic neurological disability. TBI is particularly 
problematic for soldiers currently serving or recently returned from 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 1996, members of Congress passed the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, 
which amended the Public Health Service Act to increase resources 
available to research on traumatic brain injury. Today, we have the 
opportunity to reauthorize and amend this act to include a broader 
spectrum of traumatic brain injury programs, especially those at the 
State level.

An expansion and improvement of our traumatic brain injury programs 
will serve those in


this country who suffer from the condition, while providing 
opportunities for research and development of programs to better 
prevent and detect traumatic brain injuries.

Madam Speaker, traumatic brain injuries affect families across 
America, and we must continue to invest in programs to prevent, detect, 
and treat these injuries. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me 
in voting in favor of this important legislation.
