`Mr. BRALEY of Iowa â€” 16 April 2008`

Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I'd like to thank my friend from Florida and also 
my friend from New York. We did have a very enlightening trip to 
Nogales, Arizona, and the Border Patrol and Customs agents that we 
spoke to were all, I think, doing a fantastic job of trying to deal 
with a very difficult situation.

But one of the things that trip emphasized to me is we often talk in 
this body about the cost of providing border security, the cost of 
providing national and international security.

And what we know is that the Pentagon traditionally publishes reports 
that provide this body that we serve in their estimate of the cost of 
the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we've seen those figures. We've 
viewed some of those figures with skepticism. And we've talked about 
what the published costs of this war are.

But what we don't talk enough about is what we talked about in 
repeated hearings in the wake of the Walter Reed fiasco. And I was 
fortunate enough to be serving on the Government Oversight and Reform 
Committee, when we had that first hearing out at Walter Reed. We talked 
to the highest ranking Army and Department of Defense medical officers. 
We had a follow-up hearing after the independent review group chaired 
by General Togo West presented its recommendations for the wounded 
warriors project. And I repeatedly pressed the top ranking Army medical 
officers on that very question; what are the hidden costs of the war 
that the American people aren't hearing about?

And I'm glad my friend from New York brought this up, because there 
is so much going on beneath the surface that the American public 
doesn't hear about.

If you take the average life expectancy of a 19-year-old male, which 
is representative of who we're sending to Iraq right now, you will find 
that under the published U.S. life tables, those young men have a life 
expectancy of approximately 55 years.

Now, when they come back in unprecedented percentages with life-
threatening injuries that we will be responsible for caring for the 
rest of their lives, there is an enormous economic cost that we aren't 
hearing about. And so I look forward to the opportunity to discuss with 
my colleagues tonight what some of those hidden costs are, and what the 
American people need to be thinking about as we look at the overall 
economic impact, not just throughout our economy, but on the long-term 
burden we're placing on our children and our grandchildren to provide 
these deserving veterans with the best possible medical care that we 
can.

Before I get to that though, I want to talk a little bit about what 
we're giving up right now, through the amount of funding that we are 
committing every year to the conflict in Iraq because, just for Fiscal 
Year 2007, we know that this war is costing, under the most 
conservative estimate, $137.6 billion. So the American people may 
wonder, well, what would that actually provide if it wasn't going to 
Iraq?

Well, for 40 million people in this country, that would provide 
comprehensive health care. Now, think about that. We know that right 
now there are nearly 47 million Americans without health insurance. So 
that cost alone would almost completely eliminate that gap.

We know that that cost that we're spending this year in Iraq would 
hire 2.2 million elementary school teachers, provide affordable housing 
for over a million different housing units, and provide 142 million 
homes in this country with renewable electricity.

And to break that down into a smaller level, I represent the First 
District of Iowa. The taxpayers I represent in the First District have 
paid, to date,


$770 million in one congressional district alone, as their share of the 
cost of this war. What would that mean back in the First District of 
Iowa?

Well, it would hire almost 19,000 public safety officers. It would 
hire almost 17,000 music and art teachers. It would provide 126,000 
full tuition university scholarships at public universities, and build 
86 brand new elementary schools. So when we talk about the actual 
financial burden that we are facing every day because of the rising 
cost of this war, it is enormous.

And Congressman Klein, maybe you could talk a little bit about what 
you've heard from the people you represent in a different part of the 
country, where there are different needs, but also very similar 
problems that taxpayers you represent are facing.
