Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute a 
group of individuals whose dedication and sacrifice for our country are 
exceptional. On Saturday, June 23, 2007, the City of San Juan 
Capistrano, located in my congressional district, will host a pre-
deployment send-off for its adopted Mines and their families. I regret 
I will not be able to attend the event to shake the hands of these 
outstanding men and women as they deploy to Iraq.

The 1st Battalion, 11th Marines have existed since World War I and 
have participated in every U.S. conflict since. Their mission is to 
provide continuous, all-weather, close artillery support to infantry 
and armor forces conducting combat operations.

Military service is not easy but it is necessary. These Marines have 
chosen a profession that demands sacrifice and they go forth willingly 
to serve a greater purpose. In the months ahead, the battalion will be 
facing challenging and dangerous missions. My thoughts and prayers are 
with each of them as they embark on their deployment and also with 
their families who have a different burden to bear in their absence. I 
look forward to the day when I can welcome home each member of the 1st 
Battalion, 11th Marines and witness the happy reunions of families 
separated for too long.
