Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, President Bush 
will deliver his State of the Union Address tonight. The American 
people have been very clear in what they want. They want a change in 
the tone, they want a change in direction in Iraq, and they want our 
national priorities to focus on helping families.

The President should use this opportunity to answer some questions. I 
know my constituents would like to hear three things from the State of 
the Union: One, how is the President going to work with Congress to 
really fix this country's broken health care system; two, how is the 
President going to bring our troops home swiftly and safely; and, 
three, when is the President really going to return to the domestic 
priorities.

The Democratically controlled House and Senate are ready for him to 
change his agenda, change his tone and get to the people's agenda. So 
tonight we hear from our President.
