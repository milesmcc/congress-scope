Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I've been proud to serve alongside 
Congressman John McHugh as a fellow Representative from New York and as 
a colleague on the Armed Services Committee.

Congressman McHugh's long experience as a member of the Armed 
Services Committee has made him uniquely qualified to serve in the post 
we have just confirmed him to. As a member of that panel, he always 
fought to provide for the well-being and safety of our troops and to 
ensure their fundamental mission of keeping America safe.

He also held the distinct honor, which I now share, of representing 
Fort Drum--one of our Nation's proudest, bravest Army posts. These men 
and women deserve the very best from their representatives, and 
Congressman McHugh did not fail them. I am confident he will bring that 
same leadership and determination to benefit all Army families across 
the country.

As we work to chart a new direction in Iraq and Afghanistan, I am 
proud to support Congressman McHugh's nomination for the Army's top 
civilian post. I congratulate Congressman McHugh and his family, and I 
look forward to continue working with him to keep America and New York 
families safe.
