Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with 
a heavy heart. This week, nine of my fellow paratroopers from the 82nd 
Airborne Division were killed in Iraq. Nine more heroes killed, nine 
more paratroopers returning home in coffins draped in the American 
flag.

Mr. Speaker, Daniel Webster's words that are etched in the marble 
above implore each of us in this room, and I quote, ''To see whether we 
also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be 
remembered.''

Mr. Speaker, I know the task is daunting, but let this Congress be 
remembered for leading our country in a new direction in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and 2004. Nineteen of my 
fellow paratroopers I served with never made it home from the streets 
of Baghdad. I carry their names with me every single day to remind 
myself of the solemn responsibility we face each time the Speaker bangs 
down her gavel.

Nineteen men, including Specialist Chad Keith from Indiana. Nineteen 
guys who never made it home to their families. Specialist James Lambert 
III, from North Carolina. Nineteen all Americans who paid the ultimate 
sacrifice. Private Kyle Gilbert from Vermont. Nineteen men who are 
missed. Private First Class Marc Seidan from New Jersey. Nineteen men. 
Now we have nine more paratroopers to add to this list.

Mr. Speaker, how many more suicide bombs must kill American soldiers 
before this President offers a time line for our troops to come home?

How many more military leaders must declare the war will not be won 
militarily before this President demands that the Iraqis stand up and 
fight for their country?

How many more terrorists will President Bush's foreign policy breed 
before he focuses on developing a new strategy, a real strategy for 
fighting and beating al Qaeda?

Mr. Speaker, this bill says enough is enough. No more shortchanging 
our troops. No more open ended commitment in Iraq. No more refereeing a 
religious civil war.

Mr. Speaker, on the fourth anniversary of the war, I led this body in 
a moment of silence. Now my fellow Democrats offer a time line to bring 
our troops home.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who 
are about to vote ''no'' on this bill, will you stand with us next year 
to offer a time line on the war's fifth anniversary?

How about a time line on the sixth? How about a time line on the 
10th? Because that's what voting ''no'' does. It says no to the tough 
questions. No to accountability and no to providing our troops on the 
ground with a clear mission.

Mr. Speaker, I may be hopeful, but I am not naive. I hear Vice 
President Cheney taunt patriotic Americans who are concerned with the 
direction of our country. I see the President using his veto to hold 
our troops hostage to further his failed strategy in Iraq. I read the 
Bush Republicans' attacks questioning my patriotism and support for my 
fellow soldiers. But, Mr. Speaker, we have all heard these attacks 
before.

The American people know that President Bush and his allies are sadly 
out of touch. The American people know that supporting the troops means 
demanding accountability. The American people know we need a change.

Mr. Speaker, one of my fellow soldiers lost his brother in the World 
Trade Center on September 11 of 2001. This soldier is now in Iraq 
serving on his second deployment. And last week he sent me a message, 
unsolicited. It said, and I quote, ''Never did I think I would disagree 
with our foreign policy 5 years after my brother was murdered. Our 
latest mission here is to secure the Iraqi people. I signed up to 
secure the American people.''

My fellow colleagues, this bill, this vote helps us secure the 
American people. For too long the American people have been craving 
leadership, craving accountability, and craving a new direction in 
Iraq. Let's give this to them today.
