Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. I offered an 
amendment on Monday to address an injustice against the members of our 
armed services that were shut out from consideration by this rule.

Briefly, my amendment would have given an across-the-board pay raise 
of 5 percent to our military personnel. According to estimates made by 
the Congressional Research Service, the pay gap between military 
personnel and civilians in comparable positions is 3 percent. Given 
that the cost of living increase for 2010 is 2.9 percent, my amendment 
is an important first step to addressing this problem. Particularly 
during a recession but really at any time it is unacceptable that our 
men and women in uniform receive less than their civilian counterparts.

Recently I was in Afghanistan and had the opportunity to see 
firsthand the professionalism and the commitment of our troops, what 
service they render to us, why are they being treated this way. I 
received assurances from the House Parliamentarian that my amendment 
was in order, and the Congressional Budget Office said it complies with 
all PAYGO requirements. I cannot understand why the majority would deny 
our troops the right to an up-or-down vote or, at the very least, a 
debate that would at least bring out the issues. If we have time to 
debate an amendment that would require a study of the number of 
subcontractors used by the Department of Defense, we should have time 
to debate giving our troops a fair wage.

Mr. Speaker, this is the second time that I've offered this amendment 
to increase the pay of our troops and the second time that it has been 
denied. I would urge my colleagues to oppose this rule.
