Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
House Resolution 744 and in honor of this country's Native American 
veterans.

For well over 200 years, Native Americans have provided military and 
strategic service to the U.S., acting as patriotic soldiers and 
standing side-by-side their fellow citizens in defense of our country. 
There are nearly 200,000 Native American veterans in the U.S. today, 
including members of every single tribe and pueblo. In New Mexico, 
there are countless stories of heroic Native American men and women 
serving in uniform.

I am proud to have sponsored earlier legislation to honor Native 
American veterans. During the 106th Congress, I introduced a bill to 
honor the Navajo Code Talkers with the Congressional Gold Medal in 
honor of their dedicated service during World War II. These brave 
interpreters used their native tongue to carefully transmit 
confidential Allied messages regarding the movement and strategy of 
millions of fellow soldiers. Not once was their code broken. Sixty 
years after their service, these men were honored in the Capitol 
Rotunda with the Congressional Gold Medal.

This past Congress, I was privileged to sponsor a measure to allow 
Native American tribes to be eligible for grants to establish state 
veterans cemeteries on tribal land. This long overdue legislation 
ensures that those Native American veterans who desire to be buried at 
home will not have their final wishes denied. I was happy that it was 
passed and am encouraged that we will soon see the first state veterans 
cemetery locate on tribal land.

To date, 47 Native Americans have given their lives in Afghanistan 
and Iraq. We honor their memory and their sacrifice by ensuring the 
Native American veterans who return home and granted the respect they 
deserve. As we approach Veterans Day later this week, we must remember 
that Native American have served our nation with pride, and continue to 
put on the uniform with bravery, honor, and dignity. I urge all of my 
colleagues to thank all veterans for their service, and to recognize 
the considerable sacrifice given by our country's Native Americans.
