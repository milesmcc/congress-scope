# WAR DESTRUCTIVE OF NATIONAL AGENDA

Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, the Defense bill contained a request for 
millions of dollars to retrofit B-2 Stealth bombers so they can carry 
30,000-pound bombs, bunker busters, which would be germane to the 
administration's intention of attacking Iran. Imagine for a moment 
30,000-pound bombs dropped on nuclear research labs in Natanz and in 
Bushehr, and you have a humanitarian and ecological disaster on your 
hands.

Now, the case for war against Iran is being built on lies, just as 
the case for war against Iraq was built on lies. Nearly 4,000 troops 
dead; nearly a million innocent Iraqis perished in the conflict; 
borrowing money from China to fight a war against Baghdad.

It is time to impeach this Vice President for leading this country 
into a war that is so destructive of our national agenda. It is time 
for us to reclaim our Constitution and to reclaim the troops.
