Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Delahunt.

Mr. Speaker, the costs keep climbing. Thousands of our young brave 
men and women have been killed. Next month we enter the fifth year of 
this war, a war that has lasted longer than World War I or World War 
II. Hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money has been spent, 
and some of that money seems to have just disappeared into the desert 
air. The costs keep climbing, and nobody, not a single Republican or 
Democrat, can deny that.

The question before us now is clear: Should we escalate this war and 
send 21,500 more of our sons and daughters to referee a civil war in 
Iraq? The American people have spoken out for change, and many of us 
here have listened carefully. But escalating this war does not reflect 
the hard reality at home or on the ground in Iraq.

Saying ''support our troops'' is easy, but actually standing up for 
our troops overseas and their families here at home demands so much 
more from us. We must ask the tough questions and provide real support, 
instead of empty rhetoric.

Supporting our troops requires that we protect their bodies and lives 
with the best armor available. Supporting our troops means equipping 
them with the most reliable weapons and effective training. Supporting 
our troops does not stop when they come home from the war. It is the 
Nation's solemn obligation to care for those who have given so much. 
Supporting our troops means we must ask ourselves the hard question, 
should we send more of our sons and daughters into the constant 
crossfire of Iraq's civil war? The answer is no.

Mr. Speaker, it comes down to supporting our troops. In addition to 
the best armor, the proper respect and the right benefits, our troops 
deserve the right plan. In fact, nothing matters more than the right 
plan. Our heroic soldiers have done everything that we have asked them 
to do. Without a realistic plan to guide them, we cannot say that we 
are supporting our troops.

While sacrificing health care for children and pharmaceutical needs 
for our seniors, this administration has shipped 363 tons of cash on 
pallets to Iraq. When it got there, the American officials turned it 
over to Iraqis, without any idea of where they were spending it or what 
they were doing with it. That defies common sense. It should not be a 
surprise that nearly $9 billion are missing.

Again, Mr. Speaker, the costs keep climbing. As high as the cost is 
in dollars, it pales compared to the high price many of our military 
families have had to pay. Our troops are over-stretched, their families 
are overstressed, and there is no relief in sight. Every one of our 
active duty military brigades have served at least a year long in Iraq 
or Afghanistan. When a mother or father or husband or wife is abroad 
for a year, it places tremendous strain on the family. Too many 
families have been torn apart by this war. The cost of broken families 
will never be entered into an accountant's ledger, but the cost is too 
high, and it just keeps climbing.

This month, one young man from my district was killed in Iraq. I know 
that this country will feel his loss. He left behind his parents, his 
wife and an infant son, Mr. Speaker, that he never had a chance to 
meet. I feel their loss deeply, and I ask all of my colleagues to 
remember that every man and woman that has been killed in Iraq cannot 
be replaced and leaves behind many people who depended on them.

The resolution before us today could not be any more clear. It states 
that the Congress will continue to support and protect our troops. I 
will never vote for any legislation that will endanger our troops in 
the field, and we will never vote to cut off funding that will help to 
compromise the safety of our men and women in uniform. But escalating 
this war and sending 21,500 more troops to referee a civil war is not 
the answer.



The American people have spoken and they demand that we support our 
troops with a real change in direction. As the voice of the people, 
Congress will make sure that this administration finally takes notice.
