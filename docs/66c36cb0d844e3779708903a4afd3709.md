Ms. SPEIER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 855, a bill supporting 
Silver Star Service Banner Day. H. Res. 855 was introduced by my 
colleague, the gentleman from Missouri, Representative Roy Blunt, on 
October 22, 2009. The measure was referred to the Committee on 
Oversight and Government


Reform, which reported it favorably by unanimous consent on April 14 of 
this year. The measure enjoys the support of over 50 cosponsors.

Madam Speaker, our Nation continues to face two long and difficult 
wars, and I am very glad that we can take time now to honor the men and 
women of our Armed Services. They deserve our thoughts, our prayers, 
and our support.

The Silver Star Families of America understand this well and work 
hard to help the American people recognize the sacrifices made by the 
wounded and ill members of the Armed Forces. Tens of thousands of 
American troops are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, risking their 
lives in service to our country. They also risk their lives in 
deployments throughout the world. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
giving thanks to them and to their families for the sacrifices they 
continue to make and for their service to our country.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
