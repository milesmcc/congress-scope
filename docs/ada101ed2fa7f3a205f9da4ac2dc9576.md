`Mr. ANDREWS â€” 31 March 2008`

---


Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Corporal Raymond D. 
Hennagir of Deptford, New Jersey. Corporal Hennagir was injured while 
on foot patrol in Zaidon, Iraq. He stepped on an improvised explosive 
device, losing both of his legs and four fingers on his left hand. The 
bravery of this man is truly inspiring. Out of respect and gratitude 
for the great service Corporal Hennagir has given his country, I submit 
this poem written in his honor by Albert Carey Caswell.

















Teach Me



 Teach Me!


 Teach me well!


 You so beseech me. As you so gallantly look past all of your 





 pain and heartache, all of your hell!



 Reach Me!


 As you Reach in and out to Me! With your heart which so 





 swells!


 As your most splendid heart to me, so all about life . . . so 





 tells!



 All about courage and faith!


 All about not letting pain and heartache, get in your way . . 





 . and not letting go, or your soul erase!


 All about courage's, most courageous face!



 Let me learn!


 As from you, and all of your character I can so discern!


 All about life . . . and all about what is possible, when 





 within a great heart a soul so burns!



 So I can grow!


 So I can learn, so throughout my life I can so use and learn 





 . . . of what a heart is capable of so!


 As your blessings to me you now so bestow, ever in these 





 moments of my life . . . I will know!



 Which, can so show me . . . that path!


 Which, can so show me the way . . . which can so teach me all 





 about the things which last . . .


 As I watch you and your most heroic glow! The questions to my 





 heart you so answer, I ask?



 For you have touched me, with your most heroic glow!


 For you have so taught to me, all that it is . . . that I so 





 need to know!


 So I can touch the sky, so I can so soar so very high . . . a 





 part of you, I will take with me I'll show!



 For on this Earth . . .


 Our Lord God so puts on such men and women of such fine worth 





 . . .


 To Teach Us All, to so hear his call . . . to make us all 





 understand, of what it is which comes first!


 Everybody loves Raymond, You Teach Me . . . Teach Me So!
