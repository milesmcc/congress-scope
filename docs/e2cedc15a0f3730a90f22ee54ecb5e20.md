Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise to remember and 
honor the life and courage of U.S. Army Specialist Gregory B. Rundell. 
The 21-year-old, a native of North St. Paul, MN, was killed by hostile 
fire on March 26, 2008 while guarding a U.S. military base in Taji, 
north of Baghdad.

Specialist Rundell joined the Army in 2005 after graduating from 
North St. Paul High School in 2004. His expected year-long deployment 
to Iraq began last December for a tour of duty as a member of a Stryker 
armored vehicle unit. He was assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 27th 
Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii.

Rundell served his nation and his fellow soldiers with honor and with 
courage. His commitment to this noble service earned him the Bronze 
Star for meritorious service in Iraq, a Good Conduct Medal, a Combat 
Infantry Badge, and the infantry blue cord.

Rundell's desire to serve his nation and his State is an inspiration 
to his community. After his career in the U.S. Army, he planned to 
become a police officer because he wanted to help people. His mother, 
Joanne, describes her son standing ''tall and brave'' for others, and 
his sacrifice exemplifies his family's remarkable commitment to 
military service. His grandfather, uncle, and brother have all worn the 
uniform in service to our nation.

Madam Speaker, please join me in paying the highest respect to 
Specialist Rundell and his family. He is a Minnesotan and American 
hero. His courage and sacrifice honors our nation. Specialist Rundell's 
parents as well as his brothers and sisters, Kyle, Wayne, Desiree, 
Andria, his many friends, and his comrades in Iraq have my deepest 
sympathies for their profound loss.
