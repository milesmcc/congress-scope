Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Responsible 
Redeployment from Iraq Act.

On January 10, President Bush announced an increase of more than 
20,000 troops in Iraq. Six months later, it is clear that the 
President's surge strategy has yielded no positive results, and Iraq 
continues to remain a battleground for sectarian violence and a hotbed 
for terrorist activity.

But in spite of the realities on the ground, the President seems 
intent on further digging in his heels on a failed policy that has 
placed targets on the backs of our troops as they attempt to referee a 
civil war. In the 6 months that I have served in Congress, the 17th 
Congressional District of Illinois has mourned the lives of six brave 
soldiers. In the absence of any visible progress, we can no longer 
stand by as more of our troops come home in body bags.

Mr. Speaker, President Bush started this war without a plan to win 
the peace. For the sake of our troops, our national security and our 
credibility around the world, this Congress must do what this President 
refuses to do in order to return stability to Iraq. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill.
