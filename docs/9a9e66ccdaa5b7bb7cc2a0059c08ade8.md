Mr. WARNER. I remember that Packard Commission very well, but that 
was a tightly knit commission for a specific purpose. I used to be at 
the Pentagon and worked under David Packard as Secretary of the Navy. 
We were fortunate to get him to do that. This seems to be an omnibus 
situation to me. I am concerned about having the inspector generals, 
which, again, is a creation by our committee, against some of the 
administration's wishes. They weren't overly keen on putting inspector 
generals in there. Our colleague from New Jersey has a bill to have an 
IG now for Iraq. I want to support that. But these inspector generals 
have to report to this Commission, I understand. I would not want to be 
a party to amending the law there. They were created by the Congress, 
and they should report to the Congress, not to a commission.
