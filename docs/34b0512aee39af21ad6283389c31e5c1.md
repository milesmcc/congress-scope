Mr. COHEN. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over 
again and expecting a different result.

To my friends on the Republican side, we did this 10 years ago with 
the Bush tax cuts, and it didn't work. It has been mentioned over and 
over again. It built up these deficits, including the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan that you supported so well, and has created this deficit 
that threatened our country to make us look like a future Ireland, a 
future Portugal, countries that are in great deficit, problems that we 
are putting our country and our future into. We don't need to be insane 
and try to do this over again. I feel like it's a return to Christmas 
Past.

And there's a book in the New Testament that says: From those who are 
given much, much is expected. But in this Congress, from those who have 
much, we are expecting little, we get little from it, and we are giving 
them the biggest tax breaks of all. And to the people who die and are 
the richest in our Nation, the Steinbrenners who died with $1.1 
billion, we will be giving them this year a $450 million free ride and, 
with the differences in the taxes of 35 or 45 percent, $100 million. 
This is wrong, and that's why I'm opposed to the bill.
