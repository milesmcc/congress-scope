Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
native Houstonian, who has spent the last 25 years of his life serving 
our country in the United States Navy.

After graduating from Lubbock Christian University where he was 
actively involved in the Army ROTC Program, Chief Day entered the Navy 
on October 16, 1983, and for the next 5 years was involved in 3 
different SEAL teams.

While accomplishing numerous tasks with the SEALS, Chief Day 
committed much of his time to his community. He served as President of 
the Gateway Housing Council, Director of the Neighborhood Watch 
Program, and was a member of the San Diego School Board.

After being transferred to Europe in 1989, Chief Day continued 
achieving duties with the Personnel Support Detachment and many 
community organizations. Some of those organizations include: Leader of 
the Scottish Boy Scouts, member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and 
was recipient of the 1995 Outstanding United Services Organization 
(USO) Award of Europe.

In June 1996, Chief Day was reassigned to Ingleside, Texas, and 
continued participating in community involvement. During the completion 
of his assignment with the Afloat Training Group (ATG) and Mine Warfare 
Training Center, Chief Day became Commander of the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars chapter in Ingleside. During his time as commander he received the 
highest award in the Department of Texas. The J.T. Rutherford honor is 
awarded to the number one ranked volunteer member in Texas.

In June 1998, Chief Day was relocated to the Middle East and 
honorably carried out various missions with the Navy and Marine Corps 
TAFT unit, under the Joint Military Order of the Royal Saudi Navy and 
Marine Corps forces. After being selected as the number one sailor in 
Europe and promoted to his current rank of Chief Petty Officer, Chief 
Day volunteered and deployed to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Throughout his military career Chief Day earned 42 awards, was 
selected 5 times as sailor of the quarter, and 3 times as Sailor of the 
Year.

Chief Day is a loving father, husband, and a prime example of a 
leader who promotes citizenship by participation. As Chief Day's 
military career comes to a close, I am proud to stand before you and 
honor a man who has represented his community, state, and country with 
dignity.
