Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, it's been asked that we consider this debate 
in such a way that our sons and daughters are involved, and that's why 
the gentleman who just spoke, Mr. Wilson's son has done a tour in Iraq. 
The gentleman I am going to announce now, Mr. Kline, has a son who has 
done a tour as a helicopter pilot in Iraq.

I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota.
