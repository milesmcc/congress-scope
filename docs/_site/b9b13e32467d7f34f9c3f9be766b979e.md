Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
And first I want the gentleman from Texas to know how much the 
committee appreciates his strong support for our Nation's Armed Forces, 
particularly for the United States Army. He is just superb. The Army is 
bearing the brunt of the burden of military operations in Iraq, as well 
as Afghanistan, and our committee has worked to ensure that soldiers on 
the ground have the equipment they need to accomplish their mission and 
come home safely.

Beyond taking care of the needs of the warfighters in the field 
today, we must address the Army's long-term modernization and readiness 
requirements. That is why the bill before us here today fully funds the 
most critical elements of the Future Combat Systems program, which will 
keep the program on track to conduct the limited user test next summer.

While the bill cuts some funding for some redundant programs and 
overhead costs, along with parts of the program which are not scheduled 
to be fielded until 2015, the $2.8 billion in the bill includes full 
funding for all Spinout 1 activities, allowing them to continue as 
planned.

I want to assure the gentleman from Texas that we will continue our 
efforts to balance the Army's immediate near-term as well as long-term 
needs as we work through the conference process. As Congressman 
Abercrombie said last week during consideration of the bill in the 
committee, finding that balance is a work in progress.

To the gentleman from Texas, you have my assurance that we will 
provide funding for the FCS program so that the Army can move forward 
with modernizing its equipment and its networks.

As we focus our efforts, as we focus our dollars on today's soldiers, 
we can't shortchange our future forces.
