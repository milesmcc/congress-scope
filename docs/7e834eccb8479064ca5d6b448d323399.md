Mr. DICKS. I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me.

The purpose for this is just to discuss the situation. The Secretary 
of Defense and the comptroller have made it very clear that money for 
our troops in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq will start running out 
by August 7. So we have a responsibility to the men and women who are 
serving this country in harm's way--and we've seen the horrific 
injuries that these people have suffered--to make certain that they 
have the resources to conduct this operation until something different 
is the policy of the United States.

I just hope that we can have a bipartisan vote here today of people 
who understand their responsibility and recognize that we've got to 
provide the funding. If we don't get the funding done today, Mr. Hoyer 
has already said we're not going home. We're going to stay here until 
we get this done.

So I think this is a responsibility of this Congress. We have had 
months to work on this thing. And it's now time to get the job done. I 
hope that we can have bipartisan support on both sides of the aisle for 
this supplemental.

It isn't the supplemental that I wanted. I had I think a much better 
bill. But the reality is time has run out. We've got to do it now.
