`Mr. CARTER â€” 9 April 2008`

Mr. CARTER. Hearing the comments of Dr. Gingrey, I was at the Vets 
for Freedom rally this morning, and someone read an e-mail that they 
had received from a captain in the field, and he said, it went 
something like this, I started my morning at daybreak, and I have been 
on three missions today. I have gotten home and I immediately went and 
checked the evening news, as we all do here in Iraq, to see what folks 
were saying back home, and I saw someone say ''I support the warriors, 
but I don't support the war.'' He said, ''Sir, we are the war.''


I think that's something we ought to remember. As far as they are 
concerned, not supporting their effort is not supporting them. We need 
to remember that before we hurt feelings.
