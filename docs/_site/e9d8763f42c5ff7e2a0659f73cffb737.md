`Mr. WARNER â€” 5 June 2007`

---


Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Presiding 
Officer for allowing me to come over at this point in time. I shall 
take but a few minutes to address the Senate and the American public 
about the passing of a dearly beloved colleague with whom I and other 
Members of this great Senate have shared a friendship through the many 
years.

Each of us is deeply saddened at the passing yesterday evening of 
this valued friend and colleague. I first came to know him in 1995, 
when he took the seat of Malcolm Wallop. I had known Malcolm Wallop 
very well, still know him quite well. He was a very strong-minded, 
able, tough U.S. Senator, tough in the sense that he was a man of 
resolute convictions.



We wondered who would take his place. Craig Thomas took Senator 
Wallop's place, and I think even Senator Wallop, were he here today to 
address the Senate, would agree he has followed in the footsteps of 
many great Senators who have come from the great State of Wyoming.

He also served as a Marine officer from 1955 to 1959. He entered as a 
private and was released as a captain. I say, with a sense of humility, 
I entered the Marine Corps as a private and parted, many years later, 
as a captain. Therefore, we had a special bond.

But he was able, through the years, to carry on I think one of the 
great attributes of the Corps--taught to all of us--and where I failed, 
he succeeded. I used to have a nickname for him. I called him: Ramrod. 
He did not have to say ''I was a marine'' because you could tell by the 
way he walked, the way he carried himself, and the way he had his chin 
always projecting. That is the way we were taught in the Marines. It 
fell by the wayside with this humble Senator, but it never left the 
posture of that great marine and great Senator.

As marines served over the past 5 years on the tip of the spear 
around the world, all of our marines, particularly in Iraq and 
Afghanistan of recent, it was helpful for the Senate to have Senator 
Thomas's perspective in looking out for our marines in a very special 
way.

He was very active in the Marine Caucus, meeting for breakfast at 
0800 in the morning, getting together, talking about years past, years 
present, and years in the future. Each year, the Commandant of the 
Marine Corps would come over, and, quite understandably, the job fell 
to Senator Thomas, which he loved, to introduce the Commandant of the 
Marines.

I refer then to our Marine Corps Hymn, which all of us sing. And I 
quote one stanza:




 Our flags unfurl'd to every breeze,



 From dawn to setting sun.


The Sun has set on this great marine, and that is how I shall always 
remember him. Whatever the challenges facing us in the Senate, he was 
steadfast, unruffled, and committed to the task at hand, like the 
marine he was and always will be in our memories.

It is interesting, another characteristic of marines--our good 
friend, Conrad Burns, being one, and to some extent myself--we tend to 
be rather gregarious, somewhat undisciplined and rough and ready. But 
Senator Thomas was a very quiet man, very introspective in his 
thinking, with a smile on his face. But he could project his persona 
without some of the other attributes we marines pride ourselves in.

He chaired the Senate Rural Health Caucus. I am a member of that 
caucus, and I stop to think--I do not know how many are members of it--
it was an effective caucus. We got together particularly on issues of 
medical care and how, through the past decades, that care has shrunk in 
the rural areas because of the lack of young men and young women going 
in and practicing medicine and accepting the hardships and indeed the 
less pay the rural areas have. But he left his hallmark trying to 
encourage better medical care in those regions, which are in every 
State of our Union.

We both loved fishing. How many times we talked about trout fishing. 
He always said to me: John, I have a very special stream, almost 
untouched, largely unknown, but I will take you there someday, and you 
will experience a trip you will never forget. I have missed that trip.

His constituents, his loving family, and, above all, his wife Susan 
are in our thoughts and prayers. I ask colleagues to stop and think on 
those evenings when we got our evening engagements and we were, 
fortunately, going to be accompanied by our wives, that Susan would 
stand watch at the door of the Senate. I can see that spot. As you 
approach the Chamber, it is on the left, right there next to the 
column. I would always see her and wave a ''hello.''

So I say to her and her family, thank you for sharing in our lives 
the richness of the life of your Craig Thomas.

From one marine to another, I simply say: Fair Winds and Following 
Seas to you, sir. Semper Fi.
