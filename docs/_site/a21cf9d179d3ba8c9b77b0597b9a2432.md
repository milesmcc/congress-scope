Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this 
resolution forward, and I rise in support of the resolution and to 
offer my condolences to the families, friends, and colleagues of the 
seven clandestine service officers who were killed by a suicide bomber 
in Khost, Afghanistan, a couple of weeks ago, and to offer support and 
appreciation and best wishes for those recovering from their injuries.

As Chair of the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel and a member of 
the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I am well aware, as we 
all are here, of the risk to forward-deployed clandestine service 
employees, a risk they face on a daily basis.

These seven employees gave their lives in the line of duty, and our 
thoughts and prayers remain with their loved ones. May they find 
comfort in part in the knowledge of the high service these people have 
given to their country.

Let me also take a moment to express my wishes for a full and speedy 
recovery to those wounded in the bombing and my appreciation to all 
Americans, civilian and military, who are serving our Nation in 
Afghanistan. We look forward to the day when their presence in 
Afghanistan will no longer be needed and that they will return home 
safely to their families.

I thank Chairman Reyes for offering this resolution, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it.
