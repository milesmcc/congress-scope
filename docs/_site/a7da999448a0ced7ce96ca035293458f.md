Mr. KUCINICH. My colleagues, a few years ago I was doing some 
climbing of hills and mountains in Colorado, and when I had started my 
journey I looked up into the hills and it looked like it would take a 
few hours to climb to a hill. I started my climb and I finally got 
there, it took about a half a day. And when I got to the top of this 
hill, when I was first starting I thought I would just get there and I 
am right at the top, I am at my destination; but as I got to that top 
of that hill, I saw there was another hill, and I had to climb another 
half day.

This Congress is about to climb a hill, and that hill is opposition 
to the escalation. But when we climb that hill, we are only going to be 
halfway there because the top of the hill we've got to reach, that 
second hill, is called ''ending the occupation.'' Stopping the 
escalation is only half the journey here, we have to end the 
occupation.

Similarly, people say, well, now they oppose the war. Well, opposing 
the war, well, that is halfway up that hill. Take that journey. But 
going all the way up the hill you are going to have to say, stop the 
funding for the war. The Kucinich plan enables us not only to stop the 
funding for the war, but to secure Iraq and create a whole new America 
and world.
