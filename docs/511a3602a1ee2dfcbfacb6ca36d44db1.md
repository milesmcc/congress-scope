Mr. ROSS. It's my understanding the cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom 
is $378.5 billion. That is to date. Now, you have to understand what 
that means is, at this time we are spending about $2 billion a week, 
about $9.5 billion to $10 billion a month, or, again, put it another 
way, if you do the math, that is about $12 million an hour.

The Congress has appropriated $29.9 billion in aid to the Iraqi 
people. Of this amount, only $16.9 billion of that has been disbursed 
to the Iraqis, and yet the President is now asking for more.

On February 5, 2007, the Defense Department submitted a $94.4 billion 
fiscal 2007 supplemental request. If enacted, the DOD's total emergency 
funding for fiscal year 2007, and, again, for 2006, was $104 billion, 
this is to date, today, this is $60 billion. But if they get what they 
asked for, then the spending for $2007 will be $163.4 billion. I will 
repeat that. In 2006 it was $104 billion. In 2007 it will be $163.4 
billion; or, put it another way, 40 percent more from the previous year 
and 50 percent more than the Office of Management and Budget estimated 
last summer.

Now, the administration also requested about $3 billion for Iraq, and 
$1 billion for Afghanistan in emergency foreign and diplomatic 
operations funds, if that is where you are going with that. If the 
fiscal year 2007 supplemental request is approved, total war-related 
funding would reach about $607 billion, including about $448 billion 
for Iraq, $126 billion for Afghanistan, $28 billion for enhanced 
security, and $5 billion that is unallocated.

For fiscal year 2008, the Department of Defense has already requested 
$481.4 billion for its regular budget, and $141.7 billion for war 
costs. If Congress approves both, the fiscal year 2007 emergency 
supplemental request and the fiscal year 2008 war request for the 
fiscal year beginning in October, then total funding for Iraq and the 
global war on terror would reach about $752 billion, including $564 
billion for Iraq, $155 billion for Afghanistan, and $28 billion for 
enhanced security. Put another way, it almost doubles the number that 
was prepared January 24 of this year.

In fiscal year 2007 alone, spending on the thousands of government 
contractors involved in reconstruction has risen to $10 billion per 
month, including $8.6 billion for Iraq and $1.4 billion for Operation 
Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Since the war is essentially financed through deficit spending, 
interest payments over time could amount to another $100 billion or 
more.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that additional war costs 
for the next 10 years could total $919 billion by 2013. If these 
estimates are added to already appropriated amounts, total funding for 
Iraq and the war on terror could reach about $980 billion to $1.4 
trillion by 2017.



Adding another 21,500 troops alone will cost the American taxpayers 
another $5.6 billion per year.

Believe me, we have got 225,000 troops in the Iraqi region today. If 
adding another 21,500, which the President is already doing, would win 
this thing, we would all be for it. But, again, we have had numerous 
victories over there. Again, the President and this administration 
continues to move the goal post, the victory line. And that is not fair 
to our men and women in uniform who have performed bravely and 
admirably for our Nation.



We don't need a troop surge in Iraq. We need a diplomatic surge, and 
we need to demand responsibility from the Iraqi people.

I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.
