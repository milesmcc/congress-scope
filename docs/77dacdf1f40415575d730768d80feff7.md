Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, as Members of the 110th Congress we are 
about to cast one of our most important votes yet. Americans in my 
district of southern Arizona and across the country want their 
Representatives to bring closure to the United States' involvement in 
Iraq. This vote is the first step towards doing precisely that.

A few weeks ago President Bush gave a nationally televised speech to 
the American people to announce his new way forward for Iraq. But it 
sounded strangely familiar. The President acknowledged that his 
policies and plans in Iraq had failed to yield the promised results, 
and yet his only suggestion was to do more of the same.

During my first few weeks in Congress serving on the House Armed 
Services Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have been 
listening, learning, asking tough questions. I have participated in 
many hours of hearings and briefings with top administration officials.

Those people include Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace, Secretary of the Army 
Francis Harvey, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former Congressman 
Lee Hamilton, co-chairman of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group 
commissioned by the President.

Since being sworn into Congress, I have also been reading dozens of 
letters sent to me by my constituents, flying home to my district 
almost every single weekend to meet with concerned citizens.

Recently I attended a returning warrior event in Arizona for 
Reservists coming back from combat. And last week I visited Walter Reed 
Hospital here in Washington, D.C. to speak with wounded soldiers and 
their families.

These collective experiences have made me more confident than ever 
that the global war on terror and the situation in Iraq are more 
complicated than President Bush seems to realize. Common sense dictates 
that in order for any plan to succeed it must require the Iraqi people 
to calm the sectarian violence and unify behind a workable political 
structure.

The President's plan fails to acknowledge the lack of willingness and 
capacity by the Iraqi political and religious leaders to achieve these 
necessary goals. Sectarian factions are divided more than ever. Without 
the serious involvement and motivation of the Iraqi people, the 
President's proposals to send more American troops into harm's way 
amounts to little more than having 21,000 more soldiers stay the 
course.

This I cannot support. The President should consider the views of 
many active and retired military generals who advised him to change his 
strategy in Iraq. Instead of adding more soldiers, he should instead 
focus on some of the best recommendations set forward by the bipartisan 
Iraq Study Group that he commissioned.

These recommendations include keeping Iraq rapid reaction and special 
operation forces in Iraq to strike al Qaeda militias, setting 
performance benchmarks for the Iraqi Government and holding them 
accountable, providing economic assistance to Iraq that will help 
create jobs, strengthen infrastructure, and improve the Iraqi capacity 
to be independent and stable.

Last but not least, beginning a new dialogue with Iraq's neighbors 
because they need to be part of the solution. The basic message of the 
Iraq Study Group and other credible experts and strategists is that the 
situation in Iraq is a political not just a military crisis.

The President's military escalation plan without a political 
component is bound to fail. Along with all other patriotic Americans, I 
strongly support our men and women in uniform who are risking their 
lives to protect and defend our Nation.

Our Armed Forces must have the tools, the training and the support 
that they need to be successful in any mission. I have serious 
concerns, Mr. Speaker, that our Army, Marine Corps, along with Guard 
and Reserve forces are being stretched too thin.



Instead of sending 21,000 more young American soldiers to Iraq as 
part of that same failed strategy, the President should focus on the 
Global War on Terror. Failure is not an option. America must prevail 
against many serious threats around the world, whether in the Middle 
East or elsewhere.

Mr. Speaker, I will vote to support the resolution before this body 
because our brave men and women in uniform deserve a strategy that 
honors their sacrifices. The President's plan does not do that.
