# MEDICARE PHYSICIAN PAYMENT REFORM ACT OF 2009
## `06e7c533efcf2e612991cdfbe928d1e1`
`Mr. STARK â€” 19 November 2009`

---


Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to place in the Record a letter 
from the American Medical Association and a list of over 150 supporters 
of H.R. 3961, among which are the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, the Iowa Medical Society, the Texas Medical Society, all 
of whom I think place Hippocrates ahead of Sarah Palin in terms of 
their assessment of what should be done.

I would further begin in addressing my dear friend from Texas in some 
of his inquiry earlier by quoting from the ranking member of the Health 
Subcommittee on the Ways and Means Committee back last July when he 
said he believed Members on both sides of the aisle agree that there is 
a need for a long-term fix for the Medicare physician payment. All 15 
members, Republican members, of the Ways and Means Committee voted 
basically for the fix we're talking about today.

Let me make no mistake about blame and where we are. It may come as a 
surprise to our side of the aisle we make mistakes. In 1997 we made a 
mistake in setting the formula by which we would automatically limit 
the increase that doctors get paid. Well, we're here today trying to 
correct that mistake.

You've said so, correctly, that it's the same formula plus 2 percent 
for primary care, 1 percent for other physicians, some other plans to 
help encourage primary care doctors to come into practice. Hopefully, 
we've done it right, and recognizing if we don't correct it, we're 
talking about hundreds of billions of dollars by postponing. So we have 
postponed, whether on either side of the aisle, we have postponed 
correcting a mistake that we should have done earlier.

That's where we are today. No place else. And I hope that we can get 
the continued support to do that. I hope we don't have to come back and 
keep addressing it. I see not correcting it increases the amount we 
will have to pay in the future.

So there is plenty of blame, as the gentleman suggested, to go 
around. We could have fought harder to correct it earlier. We didn't 
and that's where we are today.

Literally every major medical society in the country has suggested 
that we do it this way, and I urge my colleagues to join with me, 
hopefully with my 15 colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee who 
haven't changed their mind, and support H.R. 3961 today so we can put 
this behind us. Then we can go on and have some really spirited debate 
about whether they do a better job in Texas or California of reforming 
medical care. That will be more fun.

But today let's fix this. Pass H.R. 3961, go home and have a 
wonderful Thanksgiving holiday, and come back to work on health care 
reform.

















 American Medical Association,


















 Chicago, IL, November 19, 2009.


 Hon. Dave Camp,


 Ranking Member, House of Representatives,


 Washington, DC.



 Dear Representative Camp: Thank you for your letter of 


 November 18, 2009, regarding the pending Congressional 


 consideration of H.R. 3961, the Medicare Physician Payment 


 Reform Act of 2009. We appreciate your agreement that having 


 physicians face annual cuts due to the flawed SGR is 


 unacceptable and your support for the intent of the 


 legislation. As you know, it is the same policy supported by 


 every Republican on the Ways and Means Committee during the 


 mark-up of H.R. 3200.



 We are disappointed, however, that you and your colleagues 


 do not support the bill. As you know, the SGR was put into 


 place by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which originated in 


 your committee. At that time, the AMA wrote numerous letters 


 to Speaker Gingrich and your committee leadership warning 


 that limiting growth in physician services to GDP would 


 inevitably lead to sharp cuts in physician reimbursement and 


 a crisis in access to care for our nation's seniors. 


 Previously we had supported legislation that would have 


 allowed growth at a rate above GDP.



 As predicted, the SGR did result in a 4.8% cut to 


 physicians for the year 2002. Congress declined to intervene 


 and that cut went into effect. In subsequent years, Congress 


 did step in to prevent additional cuts from occurring. The 


 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003, the Medicare 


 Modernization Act of 2003, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, 


 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the Medicare, 


 Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, and the Medicare 


 Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 each 


 provided temporary relief for seniors and their physicians 


 from pending cuts.



 What these bills did not do, however, was make any progress 


 toward fixing the problem. Instead, Congress fell into a 


 comfortable rhythm of kicking the can down the road and 


 putting off real reform to some unspecified point in the 


 future. In 2005, physicians faced a cut of 3.3% which was 


 averted by the MMA. At that time, the Congressional Budget 


 Office reported that the cost of just a ten-year freeze in 


 physician rates was $48.6 billion. Just four years later, the 


 pending cut stood at 21.5% and the cost of a ten year freeze 


 stood at $285 billion. The AMA believes that this cycle must 


 come to an end. Anything short of permanent reform will not 


 be supported by the AMA. Every year that Congress ''pays-


 for'' a temporary solution, the cost of permanent reform 


 climbs higher still. These are obligations to our seniors 


 which the Medicare program has already made. To pretend that 


 they will not be incurred is unrealistic. To continue to grow 


 the size of the problem is irresponsible.



 As for the implication that the recent action by the 


 Administration to remove drugs from the SGR are ''budget 


 gimmicks to hide the true deficit impact,'' we are reminded 


 of a letter you signed on May 21, 2004, to the Bush 


 administration calling the policy of including drugs in the 


 formula ''our greatest concern'' regarding the magnitude of 


 the




 SGR problem. That letter was also signed by other members of 


 your committee. On June 16, 2004, Representative Cantor sent 


 a similar letter with Representative Pryce urging that CMS 


 ''remove prescription drug expenditures from the Sustainable 


 Growth Rate (SGR) determination.''



 The Congressional Record is replete with statements by 


 members from both sides of the aisle calling for permanent 


 reform. What is missing, however, is the result. The record 


 shows temporary patches and a ballooning problem.



 The AMA does not support any motion to recommit that would 


 have a temporary fix. How steep will cuts be after those four 


 years? How many hundreds of billions of dollars will it then 


 cost to fix this problem? Medical liability reform remains 


 among the highest priorities of the AMA and all physicians. 


 However, when Republicans controlled both chambers of 


 Congress and the White House, capping damages could not be 


 accomplished. We fail to see why you believe it is possible 


 today. With less than seven weeks before Medicare rates are 


 cut more than 21%, we need solutions that can be achieved 


 quickly.



 This should not be a partisan issue. Both sides of the 


 aisle have professed a desire to permanently address this 


 issue. The opportunity to advance permanent reform through 


 passage of H.R. 3961 cannot be missed. We urge all members to 


 vote for H.R. 3961.





 Sincerely,

























J. James Rohack.
