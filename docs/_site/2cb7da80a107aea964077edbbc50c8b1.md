Mr. WEXLER. Thank you, Mr. Lantos.

Mr. Speaker, President Bush stubbornly refuses to end the war in 
Iraq. It is up to Congress to step forward and mandate that our troops 
return home. Congress must deliver to the American people what they 
voted for in November. It is Congress that must end this disastrous 
war. At long last, this legislation delivers a responsible withdrawal 
of American troops.

The stark reality is that the President's escalation strategy has 
been an utter failure. Instead of a successful surge, the President's 
policy in Iraq has regressed, and the death toll of American troops and 
Iraqi civilians has mounted.

This President is unwilling to change course, despite overwhelming 
American opposition to the war, despite failing to meet political, 
economic and security benchmarks, and despite calls by Senate 
Republicans urging a change in course. The President is in denial, and 
it is time for Congress to deliver a reality check.

Our troops have sacrificed enough. Our military families have 
suffered enough. American taxpayers have spent enough. Congress must 
bring our troops home, and this bill does it.
