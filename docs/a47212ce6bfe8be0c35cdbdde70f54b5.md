Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor 
today to honor our friend and ally Turkey. On October 29, 1923, the 
Turkish constitution was amended and Turkey officially became a 
Republic.

During the Presidency of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the nation embarked 
upon a program of political, economic, and cultural reforms. The nation 
of Turkey now stands as a modern, secular nation-state which has been a 
long time friend to the United States.

Turkey's economy has grown at a record pace and literacy and 
education rates continue to climb. Turkey stands as an inspiration to 
reformers in the greater Middle East and throughout the world.

Over the past 87 years, Turkey's relationship with the United States 
has grown. Turkey has been a partner to the United States in NATO, the 
United Nations, as well as on the War on Terror. Beginning in the 
bloody Korean War of 1950, Turkish and American troops have fought side 
by side for victory over communism in The Cold War. Moreover, Turkey's 
work on human rights and energy security for Europe should be 
commended. Turkey has provided critical humanitarian and medical 
assistance in Afghanistan and in Iraq.

We should congratulate the people and the Government of Turkey for 
their efforts over the past 87 years and we look forward to building on 
the current relationship in the future.
