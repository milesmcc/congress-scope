`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 29 April 2008`

---


Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues from 
the Commonwealth of Virginia in consideration of H.R. 5631, which names 
a postal facility in Charlottesville, Virginia, after Corporal Bradley 
T. Arms, a distinguished and heroic American serviceman.

H.R. 5631 was introduced by Representative Goode of Virginia on March 
13, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight 
Committee on April 9 by a voice vote. The measure has the support of 
the entire congressional delegation from Virginia, and provides us with 
another opportunity to pay tribute to a member of our country's Armed 
Forces.

A 20-year-old University of Georgia student from Charlottesville, 
Virginia, Corporal Bradley T. Arms was assigned to the 4th Combat 
Engineer Battalion, 4th Marine Division, Marine Corps Reserve, out of 
Baltimore, Maryland.



Corporal Arms left college the summer before his junior year to 
enlist in the United States Marine Corps where he would later serve a 
tour of duty in Iraq until his tragic death on November 19, 2004. 
Corporal Arms was killed in action in the Anbar province of Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, let's remember and pay tribute to the ultimate sacrifice 
made by Corporal Arms and pass H.R. 5631.

I reserve the balance of my time.
