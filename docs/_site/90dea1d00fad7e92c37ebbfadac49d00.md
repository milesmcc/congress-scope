Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, how we treat those who serve 
this country abroad in our Armed Forces says a lot about this Nation. 
The greatest gift that we can give to those men and women who are 
returning to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan and the fields 
of battle is an education with the passage of the new GI Bill. When I 
went to Iraq last year, the troops said this version of the


same thing to myself and the five others that traveled there. They 
said, Don't forget about us when we come back home.

With the passage of the new GI Bill, we can make good on that promise 
that we all made to those troops on our visits there. I hope that 
Senator McCain and many of our friends here in this hall who have not 
supported this new GI Bill, who have not supported extending benefits 
to the troops as they return, to give them an education for a lifetime, 
will remember that you can't just go there and tell them that you 
support them, you have to come to this floor and to the floor down the 
hall and do it.
