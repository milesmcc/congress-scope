Ms. WATERS. I thank the gentlewoman from California for all the work 
she is doing.

We heard earlier from Members who had voted for the resolution to go 
to war, who have since changed their minds. Fifteen Members signed up 
for tonight, but some had to leave. They waited as long as they could. 
And so we will continue to bring to the floor those Members who have 
changed their minds.

Tonight not only do we have Ms. Lee, who just joined us, but we have 
Representative Keith Ellison from Minnesota, one of our newer Members 
who has been consistent on getting out of Iraq. I yield to the 
gentleman from Minnesota.
