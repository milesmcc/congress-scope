# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

And I have listened to his eloquent words today about the radical 
threat we face.

I have a fundamental question for the other side. I thought our 
colleague from New York did a superb job of acknowledging the good 
intentions of every Member of Congress involved in this debate and the 
good intentions of the majority. I share his frustration with the 
progress of the war to date. I share the comments made by my colleagues 
on the other side who are unhappy at how we got here. But I think that 
misses what I believe is the essential question we confront now, and 
that is, where do we go from here? What will this resolution do? And I 
would suggest that that is a question that has not been examined in 
this debate. I would suggest that many would like to wish this war 
would go away, that many would like to believe that if the United 
States withdrew its troops from Baghdad and withdrew its troops from 
Iraq that somehow Iraq as a problem would go away.

But, Mr. Chairman, you have made the point over and over and over 
again today: this isn't about Iraq.

I would ask my colleagues on the other side can they name a single 
jihadi leader, a single radical Islamist, who has said if they prevail 
in Iraq, if we will just leave Iraq, that this will end, that they will 
no longer desire to conquer the world, that they will back away from 
all of their rhetoric about attacking all Westerners everywhere? And I 
suggest you can't name anyone like that.

Let me read you just a few quotes to make this point. Ayman al 
Zawahiri, we all know who he is, a well-known jihadi leader: ''It is a 
jihad for the sake of God and will last until our religion prevails.'' 
Not until we abandon Iraq, but until their religion prevails.

''The entire world is an open battlefield for us,'' he goes on to 
say. ''We will attack everywhere until Islam reigns.'' Ayman al 
Zawahiri does not say we will attack until the war in Iraq ends, we 
will attack until Americans pull out of Baghdad, we will attack until 
they are no longer in the nation of Iraq. He says, ''We will attack 
everywhere until Islam reigns.''

Again al Zawahiri: ''The jihad in Iraq requires several incremental 
goals. The first stage: expel the Americans from Iraq.'' Note that that 
is only the first stage. ''The second stage: establish an Islamic 
authority or emirate. The third stage: extend the jihad wave to the 
secular countries neighboring Iraq.'' It will not end.

If your resolution, if a resolution tonight, could end this war and 
bring our boys home and our girls home and make the world safe, I would 
be the first to vote for it. But it won't.

Osama bin Laden says it clearly: ''Hostility toward America is a 
religious duty, and we hope to be rewarded for it by God . . . I am 
confident that Muslims will be able to end the legend of the so-called 
superpower that is America.''



We are on notice. I think we have to take them at their word. It 
isn't about Iraq. It is about our confrontation, a historic 
confrontation, with radical jihadists who seek to kill us
