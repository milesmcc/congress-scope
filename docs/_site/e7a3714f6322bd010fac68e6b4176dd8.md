`Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey â€” 23 January 2007`

---


Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise to associate myself 
today with the words of my colleague, Mr. Sam Johnson from Texas, a 
Member who can probably speak more eloquently than any Member of 
Congress on the loneliness, the separation, the uncertainty that is 
war, and the need to know for such soldiers that the Nation is behind 
them and supports them.

I have had the honor to travel and visit our troops in Iraq, and I 
have had the opportunity to visit the troops when they have returned. 
And in each and every one of them, I have seen their commitment and 
determination to the completion of their mission.

I have also had the opportunity to be with parents who have lost a 
son or daughter in the war, to look them in the eye and to hug them 
during that time, and to be with other parents who were about to see 
their son and daughter go off to war, and to be with them during those 
uncertain times.

Madam Speaker, at this point in time, this Nation and this Congress 
must double its commitment to our troops to make sure that they know 
that we are behind them and support them for their eventual and soon 
safe return to their families.
