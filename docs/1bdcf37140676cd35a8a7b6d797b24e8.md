Ms. PINGREE of Maine. Thank you very much. Thank you to all of my 
colleagues here today. It's nice to have the opportunity to join the 
two of you.

I first want to say that I concur. It was an important day to cast 
the vote that many of us did to recognize that there are serious issues 
around Iraq and Afghanistan. In spite of many of us coming from States 
where we have a lot of people serving in the military, and I greatly 
respect their service and the importance that all of us see in taking 
care of those who serve their country, this was also an important day 
to talk about the essential nature of finding an end to the conflict 
and making sure that we send the President that message.


I thank you for giving me this chance to talk a little bit about what 
it means to be a Progressive. You're right, I was fortunate to be on 
the floor just a few moments before we started the Progressive Hour to 
recognize something that had gone on in my State in the past week.

Maine is now the fifth State in the Nation to recognize the equality 
of marriage that everyone, regardless of their gender, should have the 
right to marry. As we all know, this can often be a contentious and 
difficult debate.

Thousands of people literally turned out at a public hearing in Maine 
to discuss this topic. People from all walks of life; from all 
religious backgrounds; people who were married and who weren't married.

I very proudly quoted from my daughter today. My daughter happens to 
be the Speaker of the House in Maine--far more important than her 
mother--and she gave a very eloquent speech about the fact she was 
married only a couple of summers ago by a wonderful friend of our 
family. And during the conversation preparing for the wedding, it 
occurred to her that her good friend who was marrying her had been part 
of a couple for 30 years, but because he was the same gender as her 
partner, was not allowed to be married.



So the person who gave her good advice, who performed the ceremony, 
was able to remind her everyone should have this right. I believe 
fundamentally it should be a Federal right. We should be talking about 
this at some point in our tenure.

But I'm just so proud of my home State, my own Governor, the State 
legislators, many of them who thought long and hard about the best way 
to cast their vote, but in the end said, Our goal is to do the right 
thing.

I just want to follow up a little bit about some of the things that 
you were already talking about before I close my remarks, but really on 
this idea of what it is to be a Progressive because Jared rightfully 
said that it's sometimes about asking the questions, of searching a 
little bit further, of taking the tough votes. I also think it is a 
matter of recognizing that we're all in this together.

For me, getting into politics--and I was first elected to the State 
legislature in 1992--but I became a school board member in my community 
years before that. Part of what I learned along the way is that the 
reason we do this is to recognize that we're all in this together. That 
if we're not all succeeding together; if we don't have health care; if 
everyone doesn't have a job; if we're not thinking ahead about the 
security or everyone, whether you're a soldier or not a soldier, we're 
not going to get ahead in the world. We're not going to have the kind 
of world that we want to have.

To me, that is the fundamental of this--our overarching political 
philosophy is just recognizing that none of us get ahead unless we all 
do it together. For me, that's always a question when I make a 
decision, whether it's an economic decision or an issue of health care.

I have been a small business owner. I'm proud to say that I employ 
other people. But I want to make sure that they're treated well, that 
they get fair wages, that their health care is covered. I believe 
that's part of the fundamental of the responsibility that we share to 
each other in this country and in countries abroad.

For me, that's a fundamental principle, and I'm proud to share these 
moments with my colleagues from Minnesota and Colorado, where I know 
those are their fundamental values, as well as many others that they 
bring to the floor today.
