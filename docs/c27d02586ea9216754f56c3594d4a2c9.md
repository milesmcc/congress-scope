`Mr. DREIER â€” 15 April 2008`

Mr. DREIER. My friend makes a very good and important point here. And 
I was talking to my colleague, Dan Lungren, who served here, I was 
pleased to serve with him during the 1980s when we were in the midst, 
and I know my friend from California came in 1986 to this institution. 
We have spent time, energy, resources and weapons in dealing with the 
expansion of Communism in Central America as we were providing 
resources to the Democratic resistance in Nicaragua known as the 
Contras. And we regularly hear criticism from Democrats that what we 
should be doing in Iraq is we shouldn't be using weapons, we should, in 
fact, be engaging and using trade and other things.

And what is it we have here? We have Democrats, the Democratic 
leadership, unfortunately, saying that as we seek to build a stronger 
relationship with a country that is standing up to narcoterrorists, 
that is standing up to the expansion of Hugo Chavez on their borders 
trying to extend into the country, and they are saying ''no'' to this. 
They are saying ''no'' to this because somehow they believe it is going 
to hurt U.S. workers.

To me it is absolutely outrageous that this has taken place. And 
Madam Speaker, let me express my appreciation to my colleagues for the 
time that they have spent here this evening. And I hope very much that 
Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership will, in fact, schedule a 
vote on the U.S.-Colombia free-trade agreement before the August 
recess. Let's begin the process of debate and voting right now.

I thank again my colleagues, Madam Speaker, and with that I yield 
back the balance of my time.
