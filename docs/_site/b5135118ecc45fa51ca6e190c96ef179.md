Mr. BRADY of Texas. I appreciate Mr. McCrery's leadership on veterans 
issues.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill on the floor today that 
will provide additional tax relief to our Nation's veterans, especially 
those who are seeking to purchase homes. This bill ensures that our 
veterans who serve their Nation after 1977, including those who have 
served in Iraq and Afghanistan, can qualify for low-interest home loans 
financed by Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bonds. In Texas, this is 
important. This bill will enable the Texas Veterans Land Board, led by 
Commissioner Jerry Patterson, to expand its existing low-interest loan 
program to serve thousands of more Texas veterans.

For all the sacrifice our veterans have made to defend our country, 
it's only right that we help them own a home upon returning home.
