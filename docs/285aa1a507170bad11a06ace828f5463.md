Mr. McNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House 
Concurrent Resolution 63.

I strongly support H. Con. Res. 63, opposing the President's proposal 
to send 21,500 additional American troops into the middle of a civil 
war in Iraq.

More than 5 years after the worst terrorist attack in the history of 
our country, the mastermind behind it--Osama bin Laden--is still alive, 
free, and planning another attack on our country. And the President 
rarely even mentions his name.

Instead, he pursues a failed policy in Iraq. The number of American 
soldiers killed in Iraq now exceeds the number of lives taken on 
September 11, 2001, and this war has now lasted longer than our 
involvement in World War II.

The President's response is to send more troops. This surge is 
nothing more than an escalation of the failed policy that has been 
tried several times already. I couldn't disagree more with the 
President.

The Bush policy in Iraq will, in my opinion, go down in history as 
one of the biggest blunders in the history of warfare. Why? Because the 
terrorist who attacked us is still at large and the situation in Iraq 
gets worse by the day. Simply put, we went after the wrong guy!

So what should we do now in Iraq? A target date for redeployment of 
our troops should be set, and their withdrawal from Iraq should begin 
now. Then the Iraqis who say they support their new government will 
have the incentive to step forward and volunteer for military service--
something they will not do as long as we offer to take all the enemy 
fire.

As others have said, ''The Iraqis need to demonstrate that they want 
this new government more than we do.''

It's decision time for the Iraqi people.

The President has submitted a supplemental budget request for almost 
$100 billion to further fund the war in Iraq. If Congress


does not amend this proposal to include an exit strategy, I will--as I 
did on the last Iraq war supplemental on March 16th, 2006--vote ''no.''
