`Mr. CLEAVER â€” 19 July 2007`

---


Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two final points. The 
first is the people in the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri, 
Harry Truman's district, will have the opportunity to judge whether or 
not I should have placed these projects before Congress for earmarks 
next November. I am measured by my representation in that district. I 
would suggest that they are going to be very pleased with what I have 
done.

The other issue is that we are talking about a $200,000 earmark, and 
I had hoped for significantly more than that. We are spending $285 
million a day, $11 million a hour in Iraq. If you subtract $200,000, 
that would reduce the number of Coca-Colas in Iraq by about four cases 
based on the price they have been gouging.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
