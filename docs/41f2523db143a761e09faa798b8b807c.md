Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the growing threat of 
Iran and Syria and their involvement in the current war in Iraq.

As President Bush pointed out in his speech Wednesday night, we live 
in difficult times and are facing types of enemies never seen before. 
These terrorists are bent on the destruction of Western Civilization. I 
am pleased the President acknowledged the threat of Iran and Syria and 
included monitoring the borders of Iraq as an essential part of the 
solution to the Iraq conflict.

Seventy percent of American casualties in Iraq come from IEDs 
provided by Iran. This must be dealt with divisively or we will 
continue to lose the brave men and women who are fighting a noble cause 
in the global war on terror.

In addition, intelligence estimates show that at least 32,000 people 
are being paid by Iran to interfere with American efforts in Iraq. It 
is clear we cannot win in Iraq without dealing with Iran. They are 
determined to dominate the Arabian peninsula with their radical and 
twisted version of Islam, and to defeat and humiliate the United States 
in our efforts to help Iraq build a strong and stable democracy to 
serve as a model in the Middle East
