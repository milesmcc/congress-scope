Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5136. 
I want to thank Chairman Skelton, the committee, and all of the staff 
that have brought us to this point.

Having visited Afghanistan and Iraq, I strongly agree that this bill 
will help us to restore and enhance the readiness of our troops. But 
with the limited time that I have to speak, I would like to focus on 
one part of the amendment today, and that is my amendment that would 
allow the Transportation Command to update and expand its Port Look 
2008 strategic seaports study. This study remains a crucial tool to 
ensure that our ports remain ready to respond in the case of an 
emergency, and, worse, an attack.

My amendment would expand the scope of the report to include the 
consideration of infrastructure in the vicinity of strategic ports, 
including bridges, roads, and rail capacity. We must be ready to move 
our troops immediately and to get them the resources that they need.

I stand to say something that I have said before: ''The role of our 
ports is to connect the forts.'' If the transportation systems and 
infrastructure in and around our strategic ports are deficient, the 
ability of our ports to fulfill their readiness would fail.

I stand in support of this amendment.
