Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to speak again on the 
mishandling of the debate over the Iraq war resolutions. This debate 
has ramifications which will damage the institution of the Senate and 
lower the morale of our troops.

Here is the truth the American people need to know: Republicans in 
the Senate have not prevented any debate over the war in Iraq. We are 
debating the war again today. We have debated the war in the past. And 
we will continue to debate the war in the future. What we have 
prevented is the majority leader dictating to the minority exactly 
which resolutions we will vote on. My friends on the other side of the 
aisle have misled the American people about this debate.

Our Republican leader, my colleague and close friend from Kentucky, 
has tried to negotiate for more--I repeat--more debate on additional 
resolutions expressing a broad range of viewpoints. This is the U.S. 
Senate. The majority cannot tell the minority we are going to have one 
vote--take it or leave it.

And let me be clear: I am not running from a vote on any of these 
resolutions. I don't know one of my Republican colleagues who is afraid 
to cast a vote on any of the proposed resolutions relating to Iraq. I 
have said repeatedly and I will say it here again today: Nonbinding 
resolutions that question military strategy are not in the best 
interests of our Nation. They are not in the best interests of the 
Senate. They don't have the effect of law. They only affect our 
soldiers by sending them mixed signals. But if we must go down that 
path, let's vote. However, the majority leader cannot dictate the terms 
of the vote. If he could, this would be the House of Representatives. 
But it is not. This is the U.S. Senate. This is a body with rules that 
encourage opposing viewpoints, not stifling debate by the majority 
leader hand-selecting one resolution and forcing the other 99 of us to 
vote on it.


But here we are. Americans are watching this discussion right now. 
And it is not just a debate about Senate floor procedures; this is 
about how we as Senators should conduct debate when we have troops in 
harm's way. Many Americans oppose our efforts in Iraq. That is their 
right. I respect their convictions. Yet they are misguided, because I 
believe the cost of failure in Iraq is too high to leave now. I do not 
want to have to send American soldiers back to Iraq in a few years to 
deal with an even tougher situation. I do not want to leave a breeding 
ground of terror. But I understand there are many Americans who want 
this war to end, regardless of the consequences of leaving soon. And no 
doubt there are some in this body and in the House of Representatives 
who share that same view.

We as a Congress can end this war, but we cannot end it by nonbinding 
resolutions such as the one that passed the House of Representatives 
this week that the majority leader now wants us to be forced to vote on 
in the Senate. We can end this war through the appropriations process 
by cutting off funds for this war. This is why I am so frustrated by 
this debate. This is why I am frustrated by many of my friends and 
colleagues in this great body.

Many want to vote on a nonbinding resolution that opposes our 
strategy in Iraq to show their constituents they oppose the war, yet 
not make the tougher decision through the appropriations process. I 
know many of my colleagues who want to vote on this misguided House 
resolution will not--I repeat--not vote to cut off the funding for this 
war. They just want to have it both ways: they want to support a 
nonbinding measure opposing the war but not actually to stop the war by 
exercising their constitutional right to cut off its funding.

We should not vote to cut off the funding of this war. And that is 
the basic theme of the Gregg resolution on which the majority leader 
will not allow us to vote. The majority leader will not allow this vote 
because he knows it will pass the Senate overwhelmingly. This does not 
make sense to me or many of my colleagues, and I do not think it makes 
sense to many Americans who have actually followed this debate closely.

That is why I will vote again today against moving to the misguided 
House-passed resolution without the commitment that we Republicans be 
allowed to offer our own resolution of our own choosing. Our 
resolution, the Gregg resolution, gives support to our troops. Unlike 
the resolution before us today, it does not send contradictory signals 
to the troops by telling them that on one hand we oppose their mission 
but on the other hand we support them as soldiers. That is not the 
message we need to be sending to our troops at this critical time.
