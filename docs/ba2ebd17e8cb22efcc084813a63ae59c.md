decontaminating surfaces for long-lasting personnel (e.g. clothing) & 
shelter (e.g. hospitals) protection from Chem/Bio (& nerve gas) 
attacks. Light-activated decontaminating material produces singlet 
oxygen, a mild oxidant, to destroy CB agents. Demonstrated the material 
traps & stores excess singlet oxygen during periods of sun & artificial 
light. Stored singlet oxygen is released to provide indoor & outdoor 
protection of 8+ hours during no light & dark periods. Further, no 
protection loss demonstrated in intense Arizona sunlight 39+ hours 
during 100+ degrees days. Completed FY07 Individual Protection (IP) ATD 
milestones. Started FY08 IP ACD&P phase & initiated nerve gas 
protection ATD for ACD&P in FY10 and will continue ACD&P effort in 
FY09. Technology: Sun or artificial light activates the decontaminating 
material to produce singlet oxygen, a mild, short-lived oxidant that 
effectively destroys chemical/nerve & biological agents. This long-
lasting & durable capability for around-the-clock protection using sun 
or artificial light is the heart of the invention. Our FY10 request is 
prompted by the need for including nerve gas and nuclear 
decontamination capability. This will involve added-on tasks to the

2010

Account or Provision: OP.N

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Intergraph

Address of Requesting Entity: 170 Graphics Drive, Madison, AL 35758

Description of Request: $2,320,000 for RMAT will integrate with 
shipboard local control and monitoring systems by networking them 
together and providing secure shore-based remote monitoring of those 
systems in real time. Through the use of sensors, networks, and 
software-based controllers, RMAT will provide the means for monitoring 
and troubleshooting various shipboard systems that are vital to ship 
operations, and allow engineers from various shore-based locations to 
collaborate in a real-time secure environment. RMAT will enable faster 
response times and mitigation of damage caused by engineering 
casualties, blast, fire, flooding, and equipment malfunction. 
Implementation of RMAT will increase the level of sensor data fusion, 
situational awareness, and survivability of the ship, as well as its 
ability to successfully complete its mission. The change from analog 
systems and manual data collection will save thousands of man-hours 
every year. Without funding for this effort, a need will exist to 
continue maintenance of obsolete hardware-based control panels and 
large redundant watch-standing and damage control repair parties that 
rely on slow, outdated, and error producing control systems and 
information management techniques.

Request as named in the report: Transitioning Stretch Broken Carbon 
Fiber to Production Programs

Requesting Member: Aderholt

Bill Number: H.R. 3326--the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 
2010

Account or Provision: RDT&E--Defense-Army

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Hexcel Corporation

Address of Requesting Entity: 3300 Mallard Fox Drive, Decatur, AL 
35609

Description of Request: $3,200,000 for composite structure on 
existing military aircraft has saved weight and reduced O&M costs. 
However, a solution to the high cost and unrealized weight benefits of 
these structures is badly needed. Studies done in conjunction with the 
major aircraft manufacturers show that while composite material 
properties predict a weight savings of about 50% is achievable, only 
about 10-20% is being realized in today's designs. The problem is that 
the composite materials that are currently available in the marketplace 
cannot be formed into the complex geometries necessary to realize the 
true weight savings available. This results in pressure at the design 
stage to reduce the complexity of parts so they are more fabrication 
friendly. If the designer holds firm on the part complexity, automated 
fabrication techniques are often ruled out due to the challenges of 
forming complex geometries with these processes. The end result is 
added weight and cost to the structure. Stretch Broken Carbon Fiber 
(SBCF) technology affords more weight reduction opportunities than any 
other solution under evaluation by the DoD. SBCF product forms offer a 
pseudo plasticity akin to metals that makes the forming of complex 
geometries much easier. These products can be used in all of the 
automated composite processes currently being used by fabricators 
including fiber and tape placement and engineered textile approaches 
for fabricating net shape preforms used in resin infusion processes. 
The focus of this program will be two-fold. First, funding will be 
allocated to various composite part fabricators to develop robust 
processes to mold full size prototype parts with SBCF product forms. 
Second, funding will be allocated to generate a Mil-HdBk-17 approved 
database. Both tasks are necessary to take this technology into 
production.
