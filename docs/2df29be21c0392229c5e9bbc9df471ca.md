Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for 
H.R. 2206, the U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, 
and Iraq Accountability appropriations Act. This legislation will fund 
our troops, protect our veterans, and give the much needed relief to 
the Gulf region while sending a clear message to the Iraqi government 
that they will not receive a blank check.

However, I would like to express my displeasure that the bill 
includes a rescission of nearly $683 million in unobligated highway 
funds. The cost of the Iraq war has already taken too many lives and 
costs way too much money. Our nation's infrastructure is at a breaking 
point, and cannot afford to be subjected to further cuts. At a time 
when increased investment in our roadways is critical, this rescission 
hurts our Federal-aid highway program. Some roads in my District have 
been rated among the most dangerous in the country and it is critical 
that we fully fund highway improvements to ensure the safety of our 
constituents. I look forward to soon having the opportunity to vote to 
restore these funds.
