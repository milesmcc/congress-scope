Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support wholeheartedly Mr. 
Kucinich's and Mr. Paul's resolution to remove U.S. Armed Forces from 
Pakistan.

The War Powers Act clearly states that the President must seek 
congressional approval before committing U.S. troops and before 
committing funds. As recent media reports confirmed, our troops are in 
Pakistan without congressional authorization, and they, as well as we, 
ask, To what end?

Mr. Speaker, we are running up record deficits with two wars which 
have cost the United States in blood and treasure. Together, the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost the American taxpayers over $1 
trillion and, worst of all, more than 5,600 men and women in uniform 
have given their lives. And what do we get for all of this, Mr. 
Speaker? Instead of winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi and 
Afghan people, we're fueling hatred and insurgency, and now we want to 
export that to Pakistan. I don't think so. Let's not do it.

I urge my colleagues to demand that the administration comply with 
the War Powers Act and remove our troops from Pakistan.
