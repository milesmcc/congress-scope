`Mr. KING of Iowa â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida 
for yielding to me.

I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 248. It is not with disrespect 
for my colleague from Ohio, and I am confident that the gentleman from 
Ohio is aware of that, but I read the resolution, and to me it reads as 
a retreat resolution. I think about the times that America has been 
characterized as retreating. As I look back through the history that I 
have lived through and the history that I have studied, I think of a 
little book I have in my office that I wish I would have brought over 
here. It is the book, ''How We Won the War,'' by General Giap of 
Vietnam, North Vietnam at the time. And I ran across that book 
randomly, and I began to read through that, and what would be going 
through the mind of a Vietnamese general.

First, I would make the point that we didn't lose the war tactically 
in Vietnam; it was lost here in the United


States, and a lot of it exactly on the floor of this Congress and in 
debates that began and flowed through similar to these debates that we 
have today.

As I read that, it is on page 8, it is not worth reading the book, it 
says that they got the inspiration because the United States had 
negotiated an agreement with Korea. Where did they get their 
inspiration to win the war against us in Vietnam? They saw that we 
didn't fight the Korean war through to a final victory but negotiated a 
settlement. And then I would fast-forward to June 11, 2004, where I was 
sitting waiting to go into Iraq the next day, and on the screen of Al 
Jazeera TV came Muqtada al-Sadr speaking in Arabic with English closed 
caption. He said, If we continue to attack Americans, they will leave 
Iraq the same way they left Vietnam, the same way they left Lebanon, 
the same way they left Mogadishu. That is the inspiration not just for 
our enemies of al Qaeda in Iraq and in Afghanistan and around the 
world, it is the inspiration for all of our enemies around the world, 
and it was the inspiration for Osama bin Laden when he ordered the 
attack on the United States on September 11.

We cannot lose our will. When we engage in an operation, we have to 
push it through to success. In fact, that legacy of Lebanon, Vietnam, 
and Mogadishu has been put to rest by a victory in Iraq, a victory that 
would not have been achieved if the people who brought these debates to 
the floor 44 times in the 110th Congress, resolutions that were 
designed to unfund, underfund, or undermine our troops, we fought off 
all of those resolutions. Now we have a victory in Iraq that is being 
claimed by this administration who opposed it back then.

I don't trust the judgment of people who have always been against 
armed conflict. I trust the judgment of the people who fight and win 
wars and the people who lead us through those wars that we fight and 
win.

This is an American destiny question that is before us. If we walk 
away from this conflict in Afghanistan for any reason, America's 
destiny will forever be diminished, and they will never take us 
seriously again.
