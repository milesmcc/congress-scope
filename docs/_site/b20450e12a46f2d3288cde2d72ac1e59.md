Mr. ROHRABACHER. I rise in opposition to this effort to send billions 
of more dollars to Pakistan. I have reached my threshold with Pakistan. 
We have sent them billions upon billions of dollars, and we still have 
an anti-American sentiment all the way through that government. They 
were


our friends during the Cold War. Yes, they sided with us against the 
Soviet Union. The Cold War is over. It is long over. And since that 
time, the leaders of Pakistan have allied themselves with the most 
radical elements of Islam who hate the United States; and the Pakistani 
officials and the ISI, their CIA, have been working in conjunction with 
these radical Islamicists in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere ever since. We 
should not be sending them billions and billions of more dollars. We 
should be seeking, instead, to start relying on relationships with 
India, Russia and other countries that will be more reliable allies. 
I'm sorry that I'm having to say that we should be writing off a 
country like this. Let's focus on Afghanistan and quit sending billions 
of dollars to Pakistanis.
