`Mr. DAVIS of Illinois â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank 
Speaker Pelosi for providing what we never had in the last session, and 
that is ample opportunity to fully discuss Iraq, where we are and what 
we ought to be doing about it.

I have always been told that when you start with a faulty premise, 
you will inevitably reach a faulty conclusion. And the rationale given 
for entering the war was faulty. There were no weapons of mass 
destruction, no connection to 9/11. Therefore, we never should have 
invaded Iraq in the first place.

But then after the invasion, the occupation of Iraq has been 
tragically mismanaged. Civilian military leadership ignored the advice 
of senior commanders on requirements for preventing chaos in the 
aftermath of the invasion. As a result, our extended presence in Iraq 
continues to worsen the situation, not only in Iraq, but in the entire 
region.

Terrorist incidents continue to flare up around the world, from 
England to Spain, from Indonesia to Jordan. Chaos and intolerance in 
the form of civil war now has secured a deadly grip on Iraq. The policy 
of escalation has failed, and failed again, to loosen that horrendous 
grip. The Iraqi people want us to leave, and so do the American people, 
especially those in my congressional district, and especially those 
that I encounter at churches, schools, synagogues, town hall meetings 
and on the street.

Madam Speaker, democracy and self-government cannot be imposed on 
Iraq by any foreign power, including us, the United States of America. 
Our troops have done everything we have asked of them, even when we 
have failed to equip and protect them. The problem does not lie with 
our troops, but with the distorted world view of this administration 
and the military and diplomatic doctrine of preemptive war as a 
solution to global political problems.

We must do everything possible to protect our troops and we must do 
everything in our power to take care of them when they return home.

It is impossible, Madam Speaker, to build a coalition against 
terrorism by attempting to unilaterally impose these doctrines on the 
international community. We cannot undo the many mistakes which have 
been made in Iraq. And when our national interests have been so 
distorted, when we have so lost our direction, it is the historical, 
moral, and constitutional responsibility of this Congress to set us 
back on course and on the right track.

It is time to recognize that we are enmeshed in an unending, vicious 
circle of escalating violence, rather than a force for peace, and that 
is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 508, which would bring the force of law 
to end this war.

Today we have before us a nonbinding resolution, most likely 
insufficient to end the occupation. But it can help to move us in the 
right direction and set us on the right path. Therefore, I support this 
resolution, because it reflects the will and interests of the American 
people, and I trust that this administration will abandon demagogic 
calls for constantly changing notions of success and victory and awaken 
to the world of reality.

Madam Speaker, it is time, it is past time, to bring our troops home. 
I am told that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over 
again and expecting different results. This resolution sets us on the 
right course, gives us the right direction. I urge its passage.
