Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. Speaker, if I could say one other thing to the 
American people, and that is the gentleman you just heard from from 
Pennsylvania is also an Iraqi war veteran, a member of the 82nd 
Airborne, and the folks of Pennsylvania and this country can be very, 
very proud that Patrick Murphy is here in Congress with us today.
