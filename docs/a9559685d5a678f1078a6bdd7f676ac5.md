`Mr. CONRAD â€” 26 July 2007`

---


Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it has been 2,144 days since 9/11. We all 
remember the day our Nation was attacked. That attack was led by Osama 
bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida. At the time, the President said:




 This act will not stand. We will find those who did it. We 


 will smoke them out of their holes. We will bring them to 


 justice.


Mr. President, 2,144 days have passed, and still we have not brought 
Osama bin Laden or al-Zawahiri or the rest of the top leadership of al-
Qaida to justice. These are the people who led the attack on our 
country. It wasn't Saddam Hussein and Iraq; it was Osama bin Laden and 
al-Qaida. Yet this Nation lost focus under the leadership of this 
administration.

I think the most striking story of all is this from the USA Today in 
late March 2004:




 In 2002, troops from the 5th Special Forces Group who 


 specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for 


 Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next 


 assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with 


 expertise in Spanish cultures.


Mr. President, there are not a lot of Spanish speakers in Afghanistan 
or in Pakistan. That is where Osama bin Laden is still lurking, still 
hiding, still waiting to strike our country.

This amendment says: Let's remember who attacked America, and let's 
finish business with him and his al-Qaida network.

Mr. President, we have now learned this week, according to the New 
York Times, that a 2005 raid on al-Qaida chiefs was called off at the 
last minute by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld:




 The mission was called off after Rumsfeld rejected an 11th 


 hour appeal from Porter Goss, Director of the CIA. Members of 


 the Navy Seals unit in parachute gear had already boarded C-


 130 cargo planes in Afghanistan when the mission was 


 canceled.


This amendment says: Let's put the focus back on Osama bin Laden and 
al-Qaida. Let's finish business with the people who attacked America.

I yield the floor.
