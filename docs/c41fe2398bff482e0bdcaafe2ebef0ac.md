`Mr. NELSON of Florida â€” 26 February 2008`

Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to make sure I have in 
the Record why I had opposed the motion to invoke cloture on the motion 
to proceed to the Feingold bill, S. 2633.

This Senator is certainly for a gradual withdrawal from Iraq. But the 
Feingold bill has a considerable pitfall because it starts the 
withdrawal within a certain period of time and cuts off the funding 
with the exception of allowing funding, for example--I am going to 
read--for ''Conducting targeted operations, limited in duration and 
scope, against members of al Qaeda and affiliated international 
terrorist organizations.''

In other words, the Feingold bill would allow funding to continue to 
conduct operations against al-Qaida, but only ''limited in duration and 
scope.'' I do not think we ought to limit the ability of the U.S. 
Government to go after al-Qaida in Iraq.

Furthermore, this clause in the Feingold bill would allow funding to 
go not only against al-Qaida, ''limited in duration and scope,'' but 
also against ''affiliated international terrorist organizations.'' The 
word ''affiliated'' means affiliated to al-Qaida.

There are a bunch of other terrorist organizations in the world we 
want to go after, and this limitation of funding would be only for 
those affiliated with al-Qaida. I do not want the Government of the 
United States limited in its ability to go after al-Qaida and then only 
those other terrorist organizations affiliated with al-Qaida.

I have voted against the motion to invoke cloture. There seemed to be 
only about a dozen of us who voted against that motion to invoke 
cloture. As we proceed, I will certainly, if we get to the bill, try to 
amend that portion; otherwise, I will certainly be constrained to have 
to vote against this bill.

Mr. President, I have another matter I will bring up at another time. 
I will let the debate proceed on this Feingold bill, so I yield the 
floor.
