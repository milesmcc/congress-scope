Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, this weekend, communities throughout our 
Nation honored the brave men and women who have defended our Nation in 
previous wars, as well as those who are serving in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. While parades, speeches and ceremonies are important, I 
believe it is more important for the U.S. Government to properly care 
for and honor our veterans.

Recently, the Department of Defense has instituted a new policy on 
bonuses, which does not provide servicemembers with their full 
enlistment bonus, reenlistment or other bonuses if they are wounded 
while in combat and cannot return to duty. This means that combat 
wounded veterans who are discharged from the military because of their 
serious injuries will not receive their full bonus. This policy is 
unacceptable and disgraceful. It is unbelievable that the men and women 
who have sacrificed so much for our Nation are being shortchanged and 
denied the bonuses they were promised by their government.

Congressman Jason Altmire has legislation to correct this inequity, 
but we should not have to rely on legislation. I call upon the 
Commander in Chief, President Bush, to reverse this policy immediately. 
We have a letter going to the President asking him to terminate this 
policy and ensure all outstanding bonuses be paid promptly.
