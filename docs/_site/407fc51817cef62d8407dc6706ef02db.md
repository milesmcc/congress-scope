Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am honored to share a Vermont community's 
tribute to the stout hearts and brave souls of the service men and 
women serving overseas.

This year, in recognition of Vermont's largest military deployment 
since World War II, the townspeople of


Clarendon, VT, sought a way to show their support for Americans 
stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the town's elementary school, 39 
children of the ages of 7 to 10 recorded a song called ''Box of 
Kisses'' for our troops in the National Guard. With the help of two 
local musicians, James Mee and Michael Mugrage, the students of 
Clarendon Elementary School devoted their lunch and recess time to this 
project. Students also spent their free time handcrafting more than 500 
paper boxes filled with brief personal messages and pieces of candy as 
tokens of their thanks for the sacrifices being made by these 
Vermonters serving abroad.

Although Box of Kisses is being sent to hundreds of soldiers, this 
community's project is a highly personal act for many families in 
Clarendon. Within this school community of only 198 students, 12 people 
have family members serving in Afghanistan. Marcelle and I are so proud 
of and grateful for our Nation's servicemembers and their families. So 
are Vermonters in every community throughout our State, who are showing 
support for our soldiers' families in ways small and large every day--
by mowing lawns, babysitting, shoveling sidewalks, and through many 
other small kindnesses. Clarendon's story is another example of why I 
am proud to be a Vermonter.

I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the Record an 
article, published in the Rutland Herald, in which reporter Cristina 
Kumka tells this heartening story from Clarendon.
