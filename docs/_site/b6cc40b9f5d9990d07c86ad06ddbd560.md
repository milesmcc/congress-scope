Mr. McCONNELL. Today, Republicans are going to continue bringing up 
our amendments, amendments that we think are better and more 
responsible ways to use the taxpayers' money today.

Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that most of our 
Democrat colleagues here in Congress--Senator Bayh notwithstanding--are 
perfectly comfortable with the breathtaking rate of spending we have 
been on since the beginning of the year. They want it to continue, 
without restraint and without any end in sight.

Amazingly, in the midst of an economic crisis, congressional 
Democrats want to increase the annual spending included in this omnibus 
by 8 percent, which, compared to last year, is twice the rate of 
inflation.

At a time when Americans are learning to cut back, Democrats in 
Congress are suggesting we double up. As Senator Bayh put it in the 
same op-ed:




 The bloated omnibus requires sacrifice from no one, least 


 of all the government. It only exacerbates the problem and 


 hastens the day of reckoning. Voters rightly demanded change 


 in November's election, but this approach to spending 


 represents business as usual in Washington, not the voters' 


 mandate.


Nobody wants an open-ended recession. But so far the only solution to 
the economic crisis that Democrats in Congress are offering is open-
ended spending without any end in sight. And let's be clear about 
something: we cannot end a recession by digging the country into deeper 
and deeper debt any more than one can pay off a credit card by using it 
more often. And we can't tax our way out of a recession.

February was an expensive month for American taxpayers. In the month 
of February, Congress spent more money than we did in 7 years on the 
war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina relief 
combined.

All of this spending is reason to carefully consider and pare back 
this massive spending bill, particularly in these areas which contain 
funding for 122 programs already funded in the stimulus bill.

Remarkably, even Senator Hutchison's amendment, which sought to find 
$12 billion, or just 1 percent, in duplicative spending from two bills 
totaling $1.2 trillion, was struck down.

I hope our friends across the aisle will join Republican efforts to 
ensure every taxpayer dollar is spent with care, and support amendments 
to protect taxpayer dollars.

This current spending bill is only one step in the spending process. 
It doesn't include the President's budget, the housing proposal, or 
untold trillions to stabilize financial markets and other programs

Our children and grandchildren can't afford this level of spending. 
They will be the ones left to pay off the Federal Government credit 
card that Democrats in Congress are busy maxing out.
