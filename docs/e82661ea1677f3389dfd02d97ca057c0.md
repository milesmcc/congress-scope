`Mr. CARDOZA â€” 22 January 2007`

Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker and Mr. Ross, tomorrow night, when the 
President of the United States delivers his State of the Union Address, 
the Nation will listen carefully as he lays out his agenda for the 
final 2 years of office. And there is no question our Nation faces many 
great challenges. The one issue, however, that weighs most heavily on 
the minds of the American people is, of course, the war in Iraq. The


President is now moving forward with a plan to escalate the war, 
despite bipartisan opposition. I have grave doubts about the wisdom of 
this action, as do most of my colleagues.

Regardless of one's views on the right way to move forward in Iraq, 
we should be able to agree on one thing: Fraud and abuse and flagrant 
waste of taxpayer dollars that we have seen throughout this war have 
got to stop. It is bleeding our Treasury dry, and it is further 
undermining our security in Iraq.

Some estimates suggest the war in Iraq will cost the American people 
$2 trillion when all is said and done, and that is truly a staggering 
figure. That is why the Blue Dogs are putting forward this resolution 
asking for accountability. We can't afford another $2 trillion in debt 
piled on to what Mr. Ross has already said, $8.710 and change trillion.

So Mr. Speaker, I am not going to take up a lot of time. We have two 
distinguished colleagues that have waited here to speak to you tonight. 
But I will say that I applaud the Blue Dogs, and I am proud of being a 
member of the Blue Dogs. I am proud to be here with you again, Mr. 
Ross, and I just believe it is high time that the American people have 
a full accounting of what this war is costing, and how the contractors 
have misspent American Treasury in the process.
