Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of our south Texas veterans, we 
appreciate the committee's concern regarding access to inpatient and 
outpatient care for our far south Texas veterans.

Let me say I compliment you, Mr. Chairman, for doing such a great job 
and for having way down in your heart the care of the veterans that 
served in many, many wars, not only in Iraq and Afghanistan.

These veterans have to travel upwards of 6 hours each way to receive 
inpatient care, and many times they have their appointments cancelled. 
As you know, the VA's currently finalizing a study on options to 
provide inpatient and outpatient specialty care which will be out this 
July.

And Mr. Chairman, as you know, this war has resulted in many 
casualties.


We've had over 46 young men killed in this war. We have lost more, 
between Chairman Hinojosa and I, 46 soldiers. In addition, we've had 
many more soldiers maimed and injured; and what we would like to see, 
Mr. Chairman, would the committee work with us to move the issue of a 
veterans hospital in south Texas forward.
