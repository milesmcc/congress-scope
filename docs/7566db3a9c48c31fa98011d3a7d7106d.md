Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.

To my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, I thank you for 
your diligence and hard work. Great thanks also to the professional 
staff of the Armed Services Committee. And I think we all must salute 
the great leadership of Chairman Ike Skelton, who produced a bipartisan 
product that passed that committee 58-0.

Madam Speaker, I urge this Congress to chart a new direction today 
for a stronger and safer America. We will improve the readiness of our 
Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserves. We will put a 
stop on the blank check given to the White House by previous Congresses 
for the war in Iraq and, instead, require greater accountability for 
operations and contracting in the region. We will drive more strategic 
decisions and investments to better protect our national security.

With that, Madam Speaker, I urge a ''yes'' vote on the previous 
question and on the rule.

The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings of Washington is 
as follows:



 Amendment to H. Res. 403 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Washington




 In section 2(c) after ''shall not be subject to amendment'' 


 insert ''(except the amendment numbered 43 in the report, to 


 be offered by Representative Michaud of Maine, or his 


 designee)''.



 (Pretty much the same as what Mr. Sessions offered last 


 night)
