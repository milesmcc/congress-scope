Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I recognize that this is a contentious 
issue. I also recognize that some of us will never agree on the 
question of Iraq and whether our presence there is justified. However, 
I believe there is common ground, and I introduced a substitute 
amendment during the Armed Services Committee that highlights the 
common ground.

My substitute amendment, which is modeled after Senator Lindsey 
Graham's alternative to what has come to be known as the Webb 
amendment, replaced the base text with a sense of Congress that the 
Department of Defense should strive to meet certain goals concerning 
dwell time between troop deployment.

My amendment maintained the goals that are outlined in the underlying 
bill. My amendment represents an alternative that touches on the issues 
that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, agree on. We all agree that 
our troops need to rest between deployment. We all agree that a rested 
fighting force is an effective fighting force. We all agree, hopefully, 
that these goals should not be limited to troops deployed to Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, which the underlying bill unfortunately does.

We all agree that this committee must continue, as it has done so 
effectively in the past, providing the resources to our troops that 
they need to do their jobs effectively and safely.

I believe this bill creates an unrealistic expectation on the part of 
our families and our military members. The bill does not define threat 
to national security interests, and the Presidential waiver is simply 
paperwork with no minimum standard.

I also believe this bill violates the separation of powers as defined 
in our Constitution. Unfortunately, the Democrat majority decided to 
consider this bill under a closed rule with no room for debate on 
alternatives.

Mr. Speaker, there is common ground on this issue, but, 
unfortunately, it is not represented in this bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote against H.R. 3159.
