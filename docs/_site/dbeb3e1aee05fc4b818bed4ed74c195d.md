`Mr. SCHUMER â€” 1 March 2007`

---


Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I have a great deal of respect for my 
colleague, and I know he cares a great deal about protecting our 
country. But with all due respect, I cannot stand here and say that the 
SAFE Port Act does enough. The SAFE Port Act says that 100 percent 
scanning must be imposed ''as soon as possible.'' It might as well say 
whenever DHS feels like it.

For somebody like myself and my colleague from New Jersey and my 
colleague from New York, we have been waiting for DHS to do this ''as 
soon as possible'' for 4 years. We have been alerting DHS to this 
terrible potential tragedy we face--a nuclear weapon being smuggled 
into our harbors, a nuclear weapon exploding on a ship right off our 
harbors--for years. DHS just slow-walks it. Why?

Part of the reason is that they are never adequately funded, which is 
no fault of my colleague from Connecticut. But the administration does 
not like to spend money on anything domestic. They never put the 
adequate money into it. It is amazing to me that they will spend 
everything it takes to fight a war on terror overseas. Some of that is 
well spent and some, I argue, is not. Nonetheless, they spend it. They 
won't spend hardly a nickel, figuratively speaking, to protect us on 
defense at home. So the progress has been slow.

This is not the first time I have offered amendments to prod DHS to 
do more on nuclear detection devices, on port security. I don't know 
why anyone in this Chamber, faced with the potential tragedy that we 
have, would decide


to leave it up to DHS. But that is just what this base bill does. I 
don't know what people are afraid of. Yes, we have people with shipping 
interests who say don't do this, it will cost a little bit more. 
Terrorism costs all of us more. To allow a narrow band of shippers to 
prevail on an issue that affects our security is beyond me.

Is the technology available? I will be honest with you that there is 
a dispute. Either way, the amendment the Senator from New Jersey and I 
have introduced makes sense. If it is available, they will implement 
it. If it is not available, they will perfect it and get it working 
because they have a deadline. Nothing will concentrate the mind of DHS 
like a deadline. But vague, amorphous language that says ''as soon as 
possible''--their view of ''as soon as possible'' is not enough to 
safeguard America.

Very few things that we do in the Senate frustrate me more than this. 
Why don't we force DHS and force the administration to make us safe 
against arguably the greatest disaster that could befall us--one that 
we know al-Qaida and other terrorists would like to pursue? Why do we 
allow laxity, just obliviousness, and a narrow special interest to 
prevail over what seems to be so much the common good?

I am aghast. This amendment should not even be debated by now. Maybe 
in 2003, maybe in 2004. But it is now 2007, and we are still not doing 
close to what we should be doing. Just last night, I spoke to an expert 
who said the technology is there. If there is a will, there is a way. 
Again, I say if you believe the technology isn't there, the answer 
isn't to let DHS proceed at the same lackadaisical pace, when one of 
the greatest dangers that could befall us could happen.

My colleagues, nobody wants to wake up in a ''what if'' scenario. 
After 9/11 occurred, we were all ''what-ifing''--what if we had done 
this or what if we had done that. It was hard before that because 
nobody envisioned that somebody would fly a whole bunch of airplanes 
into our buildings. We know the terrorists want to explode a nuclear 
device in America or off our shores. That is not a secret. I argue that 
that is as great a danger to us as is what is happening in Iraq. Will 
my colleagues say we should not spend all the money when it comes to 
fighting a war on terror overseas? Of course not.

The other side of the aisle says spend every nickel we need. Here, 
when it comes to homeland security, they are either defending an 
administration that has botched this issue like they botched so many 
others or because maybe some shipping interests complain or because 
they truly believe the technology is not available, and we continue to 
slow-walk this issue.

I will have more to say in a few minutes. I will yield the floor so 
my colleague from Maine and my colleague from New Jersey can have a 
chance to speak.

I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of my time be reserved.
