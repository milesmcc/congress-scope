# MAKING EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `fa0a12067163c0d77ba4e2108997b55e`
`Mr. FEINGOLD â€” 16 November 2007`

---


Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, H.R. 4156, the House-passed bill 
providing


bridge funding for the Iraq war, is unacceptably weak. While I will 
support cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of that bill, 
my vote should not be misinterpreted as a vote in favor of this bill. 
By supporting cloture on the motion to proceed, I am voting in favor of 
the Senate having the opportunity to debate and amend it. I have 
already filed an amendment to the bill that consists of the Feingold-
Reid amendment offered to the Defense Department authorization bill 
earlier this year. Unfortunately, it appears that the Republicans will 
not even allow the Senate to have meaningful debate on a war that has 
no end in sight and that does not have the backing of the American 
people.

But Democrats aren't off the hook either. H.R. 4156 purports to 
attach some strings to the funding it provides, but those strings are 
so thin and pliable as to be virtually meaningless. Since Democrats 
assumed control of Congress with a mandate from the American people, we 
have made progress toward changing course in Iraq, and I have supported 
efforts to increase pressure on this administration to listen to the 
American people. At this point, giving the President money to continue 
the war while only setting a ''goal'' for concluding the redeployment 
of our troops is insufficient. I am afraid we are moving backwards, not 
forward, with this new bill.

I spoke at some length yesterday about the administration's flawed 
strategy in Iraq, so I will not repeat myself today. I will say, 
however, that the administration's policy is indefensible. The American 
people know that, which is why they voted the way they did in November. 
They want us out of Iraq, and they want us out now. They don't want to 
give the so-called ''surge'' time and they are right. The surge is a 
delaying tactic, an effort to buy time. We can't afford to spend any 
more time, or money, on a war that is hurting our own national 
security. We must act and we must do it now.

I yield the floor.
