Mr. PERRIELLO. Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand in support of H.R. 
3976, the Helping Heroes Keep Their Homes Act, a bill that I introduced 
to help ensure that our veterans have the resources they need to 
confront the myriad of challenges in today's economic environment.

Homeownership is the touchstone of the American dream. H.R. 3976, the 
Helping Heroes Keep Their Homes Act, will reauthorize home foreclosure 
protections to prevent lenders from foreclosing on veterans' homes 
within 9


months after the end of military service. Unfortunately, some of the 
protections established in Public Law 110-289 are scheduled to expire 
at the end of this year. This bill will ensure that these critical 
protections remain available to our veterans.

H.R. 3976 is a commonsense bill that has been supported by the Iraq 
and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the 
American Legion, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. I 
appreciate the bipartisan support on this bill, the chairman's 
leadership and others', and I urge all members of this body to join me 
in supporting our military families by voting in favor of this bill.
