Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, in your mind's eye picture a young Army 
corporal preparing to drive down a road in his security vehicle to help 
in an ongoing firefight in the mountains of Afghanistan. Picture in 
your mind this young corporal dressed in the Army fatigue uniform, an 
M16A2 standard-issue rifle in his hand with bullets made in America for 
that M16A2, wearing body armor furnished him and in the latest security 
vehicle provided by the United States Army.



That M16A2 rifle was furnished by the Congress of the United States. 
The ammunition for that rifle was furnished by the Congress of the 
United States. The body armor on that soldier was furnished by the 
Congress of the United States, and the vehicle in which he rides, that 
security vehicle was furnished by the Congress of the United States.

As a young soldier, this young corporal goes down the road, look at 
that soldier and answer the question, Did you vote to support me as a 
Member of Congress of the United States?
