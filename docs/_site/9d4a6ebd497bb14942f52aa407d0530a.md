Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, every single American, no matter what 
circumstances he or she comes from, deserves the opportunity to earn a 
college degree, but this opportunity should not come at the cost of 
years of crippling financial debt. That's why the time has come for 
this Congress to ease the education burden by increasing Pell Grants, 
reducing interest rates and closing the gap between college costs and 
financial aid.

For the fifth time in 6 years, the college system in California 
raised tuition. In fact, this fall, students at Sonoma State University 
in my district will be required to pay nearly $3,000 more a year in 
tuition. That's a 10 percent increase from their current tuition.

We need to do better. We need to work with our colleges to keep costs 
low. We need to invest in financial aid, and today, we are finally 
doing that.

And it's going to cost $18 billion to help this financial aid 
increase; $18 billion, about the same as 6 weeks of our occupation in 
Iraq.
