`Mr. CARSON of Indiana â€” 13 March 2008`

Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, my fellow colleagues, thank you 
for your warm welcome.

Today, I want to thank the people of Indiana's 7th Congressional 
District. I am truly and extremely humbled by the trust they have 
placed in me, grateful for their support, and committed to serving them 
each and every day.

I want to thank my wife, Mariama, who has stood with me every step of 
the way, and our 1-year-old daughter, Salimah, who inspires me to 
serve.

I also want to thank and honor and salute a great leader who I wish 
were here, my grandmother, Congresswoman Julia Carson.

Thank you.

For 11 years, she came to this floor as the people's champion. I am 
committed to building on her accomplishments and service to the people 
of the 7th Congressional District and the City of Indianapolis. I can 
think of no better way to honor her memory than by rolling up my 
sleeves and getting to work on day one.

Our working families, our seniors, our children and our troops are 
counting on us to stand up and take responsibility for the changes we 
need in our country. In Indianapolis and across America, working 
families are struggling in our failing economy. As we are all painfully 
aware, in February alone, 63,000 Americans lost their jobs, many of 
them in the great Hoosier State of Indiana.

Overseas, we must honor and care for our brave troops. And the best 
way to honor them is to change our direction in Iraq, end this war, and 
bring our troops home.

Solving these problems won't be easy, but together we can make real 
changes and offer real solutions. We can start by giving middle-class 
families property tax relief. That is why I am proud that today, as my 
first official legislative action, I am signing on to my colleague 
Congressman Baron Hill's bill to provide property tax relief. This will 
help families in Indianapolis and those who have been hit hard with 
high taxes.

As we move forward, I look forward to meeting with working with all 
of you, Republicans and Democrats, to strengthen our economy, create 
good jobs, and invest in our children.

Thank you, Indiana; thank you, 7th Congressional District; and thank 
you all. God bless.
