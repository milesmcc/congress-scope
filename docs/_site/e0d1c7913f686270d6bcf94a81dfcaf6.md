`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 1 May 2007`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the President is going to be making up 
his mind on the issue of the supplemental and making a judgment in the 
next several hours. President Bush stubbornly clings to the false hope 
that success is just around the corner and that the mission will be 
accomplished. We have heard it all before. Ending the rule of Saddam 
Hussein was supposed to lessen violence and bring a new wave of 
democracy into the Middle East. It has not. Saddam Hussein's capture 
was supposed to quell the violence. It didn't. Free elections and the 
drafting of the constitution were supposed to be a breakthrough. They 
weren't. The surge was supposed to bring stability, essential to 
political reconciliation and economic reconstruction. It has not and it 
will not.

Only the Iraqi people can save Iraq and it is time for them to do so. 
American military force cannot solve the problems of the Iraqi people. 
It is time for the President to put the Iraqis on notice that our 
military will begin to withdraw. No one in the administration can 
honestly tell the American people we are making progress in Iraq. It is 
time the President listened to the Iraq Study Group, Congress, and the 
American people, and work with us to bring our troops home.

The President is wrong to veto the Iraq spending bill and reject its 
needed timeline for the orderly, responsible, and safe withdrawal of 
our forces from Iraq. He was wrong to lead us into the war, wrong to 
conduct it so poorly, and wrong to refuse to change course.

We cannot continue business as usual in Iraq. It is time for America 
to end its participation in the brutal civil war. The message from the 
American people couldn't be louder or clearer: Instead of defying the 
will of the American people, President Bush should listen to their plea 
and begin working with Congress to bring this tragic war to an end.
