Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might 
consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in support of House Resolution 868, which 
honors and recognizes the service and achievements of current and 
former female members of the Armed Forces.

Throughout this great Nation's history, women have answered the call 
without hesitation to defend our democracy and freedom. Since colonial 
America, women have fought for our independence and have continued to 
serve with distinction in some capacity in every one of our Nation's 
conflicts. Before women were formally allowed to serve in the military, 
they served on the battlefields as nurses, waterbearers, cooks, and 
saboteurs.

Since 1901, when the Army Nurse Corps was established and formally 
granted women rank and military status, hundreds of thousands of women 
have served with honor in the Armed Forces. They have never shirked 
responsibility, shied away from tough jobs, or hesitated to go in 
harm's way; 34,000 women served in World War I, 400,000 in World War 
II, 120,000 in the Korean War, over 7,500 in Vietnam, and over 41,000 
served in Desert Storm, the first Gulf War.

Today, over 350,000 women are serving in our Armed Forces. Over 
190,000 have deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other unheard of 
troubled spots around the world to help rid the world of tyranny and 
terrorism. They serve on land, at sea, and in the air, performing the 
technically challenging and dangerous missions we hear of in the news, 
including pilots, military police, and convoy truck drivers.

These women, just like the men in our Armed Forces, are volunteers. 
They have always been volunteers. They have chosen to serve and chosen 
to make the sacrifices that are inherent in military service. They 
endure long hours, long separations from loved ones, and the hardships 
and horrors of combat. These women have been wounded, imprisoned, and 
have paid the ultimate price for their devotion and duty to this great 
country.

It is without question that our military forces are unsurpassed. It 
is also undeniable that women have played a significant role in 
developing the extraordinarily capable military we are so proud of 
today.



Military women have been pioneers in computer science, space, 
undersea exploration, and medicine. Through their accomplishments, 
America has made great strides in technology, mathematics, and 
engineering.

Next week, as we take the time to remember our veterans, I ask that 
all Americans take a moment to thank the men and women who serve today 
and who have served our Armed Forces in the past. I strongly urge all 
Members to support this resolution.

I reserve the balance of my time.
