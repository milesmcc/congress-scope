Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we know what the deal is. The Senator 
from Iowa knows what the problem is. The Democratic leadership is 
refusing to allow amendments on the farm bill, and the farm bill is not 
going to pass until they do. And they are going to allow amendments at 
some time, and we are going to pass a farm bill. That is what the truth 
is, and everybody knows it here.

But I want to talk about something that is really troubling to me. We 
had a hearing yesterday in the Armed Services Committee. The Secretary 
of the Army, Pete Geren, and GEN George Casey, the Chief of Staff of 
the Army, told us that they are reaching a crisis in maintaining 
support for our troops in Iraq, that they need desperately for this 
Congress to fulfill its responsibility to support the troops we have 
sent into the field in harm's way to execute the policy of this Nation.

They are there because we sent them there. They are doing fabulous 
work, and they need support.

Just remember, this summer we had a long debate about what to do. 
President Bush said we need to change our policy. The American people 
said we need to change our policy. We sent General Petraeus there. I 
see the Senator from Texas. I don't know if she wants additional time.
