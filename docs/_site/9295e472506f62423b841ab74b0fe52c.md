Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, the National Counterterrorism Center 
recently issued a report entitled, ''Al Qaeda Better Positioned to 
Strike the West.'' This report concludes that al Qaeda has reorganized, 
regrouped, and is stronger now than it has been in years.

Yesterday, in the Armed Services Committee, we heard testimony that 
al Qaeda has established itself in the mountains along the Afghanistan-
Pakistan border and is operating with relative impunity. On Tuesday, 
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff says he has a gut feeling 
we will be attacked this summer.

For years, Democrats have been saying we need to focus our efforts on 
combating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the President took 
our brave soldiers and our resources to Iraq. Now it appears that the 
President's disastrous policy of ignoring the real threats and bogging 
our military down in Iraq has borne fruit. The area and the country is 
destabilized and more dangerous to their neighbors and to us. Thanks to 
the President's policy, our military is now overextended, our Nation is 
deep in debt, and our international reputation is stained.

This cannot be allowed to continue. We are America the beautiful. We 
are the greatest country on Earth. We are the beacon of light and hope. 
We need to withdraw from Iraq, place our soldiers in a place where they 
can respond to any terrorist threats, and protect our borders as we 
once again reclaim our moral reputation.
