Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of a great American 
hero, Ssgt Jeremy Austin of Statesville, North Carolina. Jeremy is a 
Marine who lost both his legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan on 
April 11, 2009. Like many of our men who have given so much for our 
country, Jeremy is a work of art. His courage, his faith, and his 
strength of character are golden examples to us all. He and his wife 
Chrissy are a credit to our Nation and to the United States Marine 
Corps. Jeremy and the many fathers and mothers like him who were 
injured in the line of duty have set an example for our Nation's sons 
and daughters that will help carry them through life, and make our 
country a much better place. I ask that this poem, penned in honor of 
Jeremy and his family by Albert Carey Caswell, be placed in the Record.
















 ''I Want''

 (In Honor of an American Hero, SSgt Jeremy Austin, the United States 











Marines 2nd Force Recon CO)



 I want to be!


 Just, like my Father . . . my Daddy . . .


 A United States Marine!


 One of the greatest things, this country has ever seen!


 I want, to grow up to be strong and tall!


 With hearts of courage full, ready to answer our Nation's 





 call!


 To go where Angels, so fear to tread!


 Who with tears in eyes, for my beloved brothers who have bled 





 . . .


 Someone, who stands for something!


 For Honor, Faith, Courage, and Grace!


 Who brings tears, to even our Lord's 





 face. . .


 To Teach people! To Reach People!


 To All Hearts, To So Beseech People!


 All in what, his fine life has said!


 Who all in his lifetime, has never followed





 . . . but led!


 Who Could give up his two fine legs . . . Who will not moan, 





 will not beg!


 And come back home, And rebuild with his courage all over 





 again!


 If only, I could be half the Man!


 But, now I Know . . . I know I Can!


 Because, inside of me . . . beats, his my fine Father's 





 heart!


 For part of him, is now of me . . . The best part!


 For I am of his blood, and I have his heart!


 For I am so blessed, because my Father is one of America's 





 best!


 Superman and Batman, are not real!


 But, my Daddy . . . He's an American Hero, The Real Deal!


 And my Mommy is, for all she's been through!


 Yes, I want! I Want To Be!


 Just like Father, Just My Daddy!


 A Freedom Fighter, A United States Marine
