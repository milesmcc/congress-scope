Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from California for his work within 
the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition to write and 
craft this Iraq war accountability bill known as House Resolution 97.

In the remaining 3 minutes or so we have left, I am going to yield to 
my friend, fellow Blue Dog member from the State of Georgia, Mr. David 
Scott.
