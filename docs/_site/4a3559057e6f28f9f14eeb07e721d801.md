`Mr. DAVIS of Illinois â€” 28 February 2008`

---


Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
might consume.

As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of S. 
2478 which names a postal facility in the town of East Hampstead, New 
Hampshire, after Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh.

S. 2478, which was introduced in the Senate by Senator John Sununu on 
December 13, 2007, and passed by the Chamber under unanimous consent on 
December 19, 2007, has been considered and reported out of the 
Oversight Committee by voice vote as of January 29, 2008.

Like many of the postal naming measures in which this body has 
previously considered and passed over the past couple of years, S. 2478 
seeks to honor the service and dedication of a heroic American 
serviceman, the Honorable Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh, by naming 
after him the post office in his hometown of East Hampstead, New 
Hampshire.

Born and raised in the fine city of East Hampstead, New Hampshire, 
Captain Grassbaugh is held in high esteem by friends and family alike 
who recall him as an exceptional student and active community 
volunteer. After graduating from high school with honors, Captain 
Grassbaugh attended Johns Hopkins University where he graduated in 2003 
with a bachelor's degree in computer science. During his collegiate 
pursuits at Johns Hopkins, Captain Grassbaugh also served as the 
battalion commander for the school's ROTC program.

After completing U.S. Army Ranger School in April 2004, Captain 
Grassbaugh was assigned to the 5th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 3rd 
Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, North 
Carolina. Sadly, however, on April 7, 2007, while serving in Iraq, 
Captain Jonathan Grassbaugh was tragically killed when an improvised 
explosive device detonated near his unit in Zaganiyah, Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, given Captain Grassbaugh's commitment to his community, 
his vocation and, of course, his country, I think it only fitting that 
we pass the underlying measure to designate the post office on Colby 
Corner in East Hampstead, New Hampshire, as the Captain Jonathan D. 
Grassbaugh Post Office.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
