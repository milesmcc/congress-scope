`Mr. REID â€” 25 September 2009`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will 
resume consideration of the appropriations bill for the Department of 
Defense. There will be no rollcall votes during today's session, but at 
3:30 p.m. today, Paul Kirk will be sworn in as the new Senator from 
Massachusetts, filling in for the late Senator Kennedy.

As I speak, we have an international war on terrorism, we have 
American troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we have a 
Defense appropriations bill which is now before the Senate. The 
appointment of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Michael 
Mullen, expires on September 30. It would be absolutely unacceptable to 
allow his position to be vacant at a time when our Nation is so engaged 
internationally. I hope we can count on the cooperation of all my 
colleagues in allowing this nomination to proceed without delay--
immediately.

Mr. President, would you announce the business of today.
