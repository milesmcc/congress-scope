Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to rise today to 
recognize the work of some remarkable Georgians, Ed and Mary Ettel, of 
Marietta, who happen to be in the gallery this morning. The Ettels have 
worked together in their community to help touch the lives of our men 
and women in uniform. Guided by the Any Soldier Foundation, Ed and Mary 
send requested goods to our soldiers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Somalia, and Kosovo. Soldiers can go to www.anysoldier.com 
and request what specifically they need and want. Good people such as 
the Ettels are making sure these soldiers' requests do not go 
unnoticed.

Serving 4 years of Active Duty in the U.S. Navy and 22 years on 
Reserve Duty, Ed Ettel undoubtedly knows what it means to sacrifice for 
his country. However, his loyalties to his fellow men and women in 
uniform did not end with his retirement. Together with his wife Mary, 
and daughters Erin and Alison, the Ettels committed themselves to being 
a support group for those who are serving overseas today.

For the Ettels, many Saturdays over the past 2 years have been 
similar to last Saturday. The smell of pancakes usually welcomes 40 
volunteers arriving at the Ettel's house at Sope Creek Farm. After 
breakfast, the volunteers pick a soldier's request from the Any Soldier 
Web site, take it into the inventory room, and pack boxes with food, 
magazines, school supplies, clothing, toys or Christmas decorations. 
They also include a handwritten letter of support to each individual 
soldier, thanking them for their service.

Because of the Ettels' community leadership and the help they have 
received from the other members of the Mount Bethel United Methodist 
Church in Marietta, volunteers have been able


to collectively send 496 boxes, weighing over 4 tons, to servicemembers 
in theaters around the globe.

One of the most fulfilling parts of the experience for these 
volunteers is how the soldiers respond. There have been countless 
thank-you and appreciation notes sent from the soldiers, letting them 
know how great it is that people back home support them and acknowledge 
the sacrifices they are making.

It is unclear whether the motivation behind the Ettels' generosity 
comes from Mary's history as a public servant in our school system, 
Ed's service to his country in the Navy as well as the Navy Reserve or 
if it is out of sheer gratitude for the Nation in which they live. It 
is clear the Ettels' appreciation for the troops and their love of 
country has been contagious among civic organizations, school groups, 
church groups, businesses, and fellow members of their community.

People such as the Ettels make this Nation the greatest in the world. 
I am proud to say such patriotic Americans live in my home State of 
Georgia. Words cannot express America's gratitude for our Armed Forces 
and their service and sacrifice for this Nation. As Veterans Day 
approaches, we should all remember to acknowledge those sacrifices, and 
I challenge all Americans to follow the lead of Mary and Ed Ettel in 
finding a way to say thank you.



















Iraq


Mr. President, I also rise today to discuss the progress we are 
making in Iraq. Over the past few months, we have witnessed some 
encouraging developments, and I think it is important to acknowledge 
the successes of our men and women in uniform and the successes of the 
Iraqi people in helping to secure their own Nation.

Since the troop surge was fully implemented, in June 2007, we have 
seen a steady decline in Iraqi civilian deaths, a decline in the number 
of bombings, and a decline in the number of incidents involving the 
most deadly form of roadside bombs known as explosively formed 
penetrators.

We have sent our forces into Iraqi neighborhoods in order to root out 
extremists and gain the trust and confidence of the people, and we are 
seeing encouraging results. Since the surge of operations began in 
June, the number of IED attacks per week has declined by half. U.S. 
military deaths have fallen to their lowest level in 19 months.

One year ago, Al Anbar was thought to be lost to the enemy. At the 
time, al-Qaida staged a parade in the city streets to flaunt its 
control. Last week, there was another parade in Al Anbar Province. Only 
this time it was a parade of Iraqi citizens and Iraqi forces who had 
reclaimed their homes and driven the terrorists out. Iraqi forces have 
now assumed responsibility for security in 8 of the 18 Iraqi provinces. 
Across the country, brave Iraqis are increasingly taking on 
responsibility for their own safety and security.

The improvements we are witnessing in Iraq further confirm the report 
given by GEN David Petraeus, Commanding General of the Multinational 
Forces in Iraq, before Congress in September regarding the troop surge. 
While testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, he stated:




 The military objectives of the surge are in large measure 


 being met. In recent months, in the face of tough enemies and 


 the brutal summer heat of Iraq, coalition and Iraqi security 


 forces have achieved progress in this arena.


Our enemies see the changes underway and increasingly fear they are 
on the wrong side of events. Day by day, our forces are seizing the 
initiative from the enemy. Osama bin Laden, who is in hiding out of 
fear of U.S. forces, has publicly expressed concern about al-Qaida's 
recent setback in Iraq. In an audiotape, he talks about the mistakes 
al-Qaida has made and urges terrorists to overcome what he says are 
growing divisions in their ranks.

This return on our success in Iraq means we are slowly beginning to 
bring some of our forces home, and we are doing it from a position of 
strength. The military did not replace 2,200 Marines who came home from 
Al Anbar Province in September, and we will also bring home an Army 
combat brigade, for a total force reduction of 5,700 troops by 
Christmas.

While there is good news in Iraq, news that is important for the 
American people to hear, there are also remaining challenges we need to 
be realistic about. Parts of Iraq continue to be violent and difficult.

The terrorists are still capable of carrying out attacks that will 
dominate headlines, and the Iraqi security forces will continue to 
require U.S. support. Now is certainly not the time to give up, 
restrict funding, or set a surrender date, as some in this body have 
argued we should do.

As we continue to debate Iraq in the body in the coming months, I 
hope we can all acknowledge there has been real progress, and work 
together to ensure this progress is not wasted. That approach is 
clearly in the interests of all Americans and is in the interests of 
the Iraqi people as well.

As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Member from 
a State with a strong military presence, I am committed to supporting 
our troops and their families and making sure their needs are met.

Clearly our military has answered the call of duty and they continue 
to perform courageously, and I for one will do whatever I can to ensure 
they have the resources and equipment to continue executing their 
mission, and that their families back home receive the support and 
assistance that we owe them.

I yield the floor.
