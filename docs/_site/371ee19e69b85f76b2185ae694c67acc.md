Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to Marine 
Corporal Max William Donahue. He lost his life on August 7, 2010 after 
he was severely wounded in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

He was assigned to Military Police Support Company, First Marine 
Expeditionary Force Headquarters Group, Camp Pendleton, California.

Corporal Donahue served two previous combat tours in Iraq before 
deploying to Afghanistan.

Corporal Donahue was the son of Gregory Donahue of Worthington, 
Kentucky.

Today, as we celebrate the life and accomplishments of this 
exceptional Kentuckian, my thoughts and prayers are with Corporal 
Donahue's family and friends.

We are all deeply indebted to Corporal Donahue for his service and 
his sacrifice.
