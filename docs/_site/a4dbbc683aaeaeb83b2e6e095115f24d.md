Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will take time today not 
just to remember but to honor the sacrifice and courage of SFC Jared C. 
Monti of Raynham, MA. It is a solemn privilege to do so for a man who 
has been awarded our Nation's highest military decoration--the Medal of 
Honor.

Sergeant Monti joins an elite group of Americans who have received 
the Medal of Honor. Just 3,447 before him--all soldiers, sailors, 
marines, and airmen of uncommon courage, valor, and gallantry--have 
been so honored. He is the sixth to be awarded the Medal of Honor for 
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Millions of Americans have defended our Nation's liberty for more 
than two centuries. But these 3,447 and now Sergeant Monti--risked 
their lives above and beyond the call of duty. And 617, like Sergeant 
Monti, gave their lives for the cause of America's freedom.

Our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen perform acts of bravery 
every day. But some of those acts, like Sergeant Monti's on June 26, 
2006, exceed even our country's highest expectations.

During his more than 12 years in the Army, Sergeant Monti was 
recognized by his superiors as a man with a career of unlimited 
potential ahead of him. But Sergeant Monti's final act of bravery, on 
that fateful day in June 2006, also showed him to be a selfless leader 
with uncommon courage.

Sergeant Monti was leading a patrol of 16 troops on a mountain range 
in Afghanistan when attacked by a Taliban force of more than 50 
fighters. Sergeant Monti not only prevented the Taliban force from 
overrunning his unit but also positioned his forces to disrupt a 
flanking attempt.

The sergeant managed to call in air support which eventually forced 
the enemy to retreat and prevented the patrol from being overrun 
against overwhelming odds.

When he realized one of his fellow soldiers was missing, he went 
searching for him. He found him lying wounded and exposed in the open 
ground. Sergeant Monti exposed himself to heavy enemy fire three times 
trying to rescue the wounded soldier. On the third attempt, the 
sergeant was mortally wounded.

Sergeant Monti's ability to act quickly and decisively in the midst 
of enemy fire is testimony to his leadership, without which his 
patrol's casualty rate that day would have been substantially higher.

Courage is one of the virtues we as Americans admire most. That is 
why the highest military decoration--and one of the oldest--our country 
bestows on its soldiers is the Medal of Honor. It has been awarded only 
to the few possessing a special brand of courage, heroism, and 
patriotism, Americans like Sergeant Monti.

Sergeant Monti was an extraordinary American and an extraordinary 
soldier, one of extraordinary gallantry. By his actions, he has taken 
his rightful place in the revered company of our country's most 
selfless heroes.

By tradition, Medal of Honor winners are shown the highest respect 
with salutes by all ranks, from the Commander in Chief on down. It is a 
fitting tradition for we stand in awe of these brave warriors. So I am 
proud to join all those saluting Sergeant Monti this day, including the 
Commander in Chief. And on behalf of a grateful nation and his home 
State of Massachusetts, we also salute his parents, Paul and Janet, and 
express our gratitude to them for their sacrifice which cannot be 
expressed in words.
