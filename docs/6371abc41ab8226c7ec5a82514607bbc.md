Mr. KUCINICH. With the passing of the war supplemental, our creation, 
the Iraqi Government, must meet certain benchmarks of performance, 
including turning over most of their oil assets worth as much as $21 
trillion to international oil companies.

The administration blows up Iraq, is responsible for the deaths of 
perhaps as many as a million Iraqi citizens; the administration 
triggers a civil war, takes $10 billion in Iraq oil proceeds, which 
disappear, and now tells the Iraqis they better start behaving or the 
U.S. won't give them more support.

This isn't politics; this is pathology. Instead of passing 
legislation to continue the war, we should instead deny funds for the 
war and begin documenting war crimes.

It is time this Congress took responsibility to bring the troops 
home, to end this war, to restore our Constitution and reconnect our 
country to the highest values of truth and justice.
