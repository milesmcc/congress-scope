Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlelady from New 
York for her work with me on this.

Mr. Chairman, by way of brief background, there is a strong and 
vibrant minority community of Christians in Iraq. Some the oldest 
Christians in the world are these various sects: The Assyrian Church of 
the East, the Assyrian Church of the East Ancient, the Assyrian 
Evangelical, the Syriac Orthodox, the Syriac Catholic, the Coptic 
Church, the Armenian Catholic, the Armenian Evangelical, the Armenian 
Orthodox, and the Chaldean have their origins in Iraq and other Middle 
Eastern countries such as Iran, Turkey and Syria.

Like other ethnic minorities residing in the Middle East, throughout 
their history these various sects have been used as pawns by major 
powers in the region. Unfortunately, their Christian faith has made 
them targets and they frequently have been subjected to harassment and 
violence throughout the region.

In particular, the regime of Saddam Hussein was particularly brutal 
in their treatment of Christians. Because of their religion and because 
the majority of Christians opposed Saddam's regime, many of their 
leaders were assassinated and subjected to arbitrary detention.

The war in Iraq exacerbated this situation and further endangers the 
faith of this group. It is estimated that as many as 40,000 Iraqi 
Christians, 5 percent of the faithful, have left the country since the 
war has begun. While Iraqi Christians make up just 3 percent of the 
overall population, reports are that Christians make up more than 20 
percent of the refugee exodus to Syria, and there are mounting fears 
that if Iraq becomes an Islamic theocracy, the exodus will accelerate.

My congressional district, the 18th District of California, happens 
to be home to a large Assyrian population. I have heard the horror 
stories from some in my district, and I am committed to ensuring that 
the interests of the Assyrians and the broader Christian community are 
well protected in the new Iraq.

I have taken numerous steps to protect the rights of the minority. In 
particular I have written a letter on the subject to Secretary Rice and 
have implored her to use all means available to ensure that the rights 
of this group are respected.

To further enhance our ability to protect these people, it is my 
understanding that there is report language in this bill which urges 
that $10 million in the recently enacted supplemental be targeted 
towards helping the Christian community in Iraq. I want to work with 
the chairwoman and the rest of the members of the committee to ensure 
that this money goes for its intended purpose of protecting this 
community and does not get diverted to other issues.
