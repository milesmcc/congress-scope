Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, here we are again. 
Another week has gone by, and we are still discussing the Iraq 
emergency supplemental. The Democrats were successful in forwarding a 
strategy of cut and run, knowing the entire time their strategy would 
be vetoed by the President.

It is an ill-conceived idea to state you support the troops on the 
one hand while on the other hand you push forward with legislation that 
you know has no chance of gaining the President's support. I believe 
the Democrat leadership owes the American people an explanation of why 
they would do this.

Time is up and the Democrats need to come back to the realization 
that our troops don't deserve to be caught in the political mess 
between the radical left and the rest of the Democrat Party. It is time 
for a clean supplemental to come to the floor so that we can send the 
President a bill that supports our troops without handcuffing our 
generals and withdrawing our troops before this critical mission is 
complete.
