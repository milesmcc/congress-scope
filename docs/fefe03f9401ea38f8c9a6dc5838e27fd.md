Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1105, the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act and specifically Division H, the State 
and Foreign Operations section.

Despite unprecedented domestic challenges, the United States cannot 
afford to pull back on our commitments to critical national security 
and development initiatives abroad. This bill provides the 
Administration with funds to begin rebuilding our diplomatic and 
development capacity, restore American leadership and meet critical 
needs by providing: $7.1 billion for global health programs, including 
$5.5 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria programs; $1.3 billion 
to address humanitarian emergencies worldwide, including in Gaza; $1.5 
billion to continue basic education, safe water and environment 
initiatives around the world; $4.4 billion in assistance to vital 
allies in the Middle East, including funding for Israel and Egypt at 
levels agreed to in MOUs between the United States and those countries 
and $498 million for Jordan; $1.8 billion to help secure and stabilize 
Afghanistan and Pakistan; $1 billion to fund counternarcotics, law 
enforcement and economic development in Latin America; $1.36 billion in 
economic and security assistance for Africa as well as $3.9 billion to 
fight HIV/AIDS and meet other health needs; and $6.1 billion to hire, 
train, and protect an estimated 500 additional diplomats at the State 
Department and 300 new staff at USAID, and while continuing the 
existing law banning the use of U.S. government funds for the provision 
of abortions, it funds the UN Population Fund, a vital partner in 
health programs around the world.

I would like to thank our staff for their tireless work. This bill 
will provide President Obama and Secretary Clinton with key resources 
to protect America and improve the lives of millions around the world.
