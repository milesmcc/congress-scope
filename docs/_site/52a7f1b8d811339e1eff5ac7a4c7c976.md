`Mr. ALTMIRE â€” 7 March 2007`

---


Mr. ALTMIRE. This is in the context of being told, the American 
people were told, that the oil proceeds in Iraq would pay for the cost 
of the war. You have a couple of issues. One is the oil proceeds. We do 
not have any accounting of where a lot of them are going. They are 
disappearing into the black market. They are certainly not paying for 
the cost of the war.

The second issue is, we have paid almost $400 billion as a Nation on 
the Iraq War of our money, the American people's money, and as you have 
outlined, we have lost billions of dollars in Iraq that is completely 
unaccounted for. You certainly know about that from the Government 
Oversight Committee, and I am sure we will talk more about that.

In just the few minutes that we have remaining, about 4 minutes 
remaining, I did want to talk about budget season. Here we are in the 
spring, and as our loyal constituents and people who follow the 30 
Something Working Group will know, we do talk about the budget at some 
length and rightly so, because the budget has not been managed well 
over the past 6 years.


We have an administration that came into office. We had just had four 
consecutive years of budget surpluses that were forecast as far as the 
eye can see, and in the last 6 years, we have had six consecutive 
budget deficits that are now forecast as far as the eye can see. There 
has been a $9 trillion swing in the 10-year forecast from a $5.5 
trillion surplus over 10 years to a $3.5 trillion dollar because of the 
fiscal mismanagement that we have seen over the past 6 years. The 
President just submitted to us his 2007 out-of-balance budget.

So I will use this as a teaser for perhaps our next 30 Something 
Working Group because we will not be able to get into it as much as we 
would like, but for those watching, I would just say that we are going 
to talk at great length about some of these issues in the coming weeks.

We were going to talk about foreign-held debt today, and I have a 
chart that I would refer my colleagues to. This President has added 
more than $1 trillion of foreign-held debt to America's balance in just 
6 years. He did more than his 42 predecessors combined in just 6 years. 
The history of the country up to his administration had put less in 
foreign-held debt than he did in just 6 years.

So let us take a look at who is holding this debt. I get this 
question all the time because I talk about the deficit and the debt and 
who is holding it. Japan holds $644 billion in American debt right now. 
China holds $350 billion of American debt. That is after only 1 year 
earlier it was $250 billion. So the Chinese have added $100 billion in 
American-held debt. The U.K., $240 billion, and you can see the other 
countries down here, Hong Kong is on there. Of course, they are now 
part of China. This was a historical chart.

So we have a lot of work to do to restore fiscal responsibility, but 
we are going to be talking in the weeks ahead in how we are going to do 
that with this Congress.

We have already taken the steps to move in that direction with the 
pay-as-you-go budget scoring, and you are going to see some things 
happening with the budget that have not been done in 6 or 7 years 
because we do have a responsibility to be fiscally responsible. The 
American people sent us here to do that.

So with that, I would ask Mr. Murphy if he does not have any 
comments, he has got his e-mail chart there.
