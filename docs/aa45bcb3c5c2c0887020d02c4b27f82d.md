Mr. REID. The issue before the American people that relates to Iraq 
is the surge--the escalation of the war in Iraq. That is the debate 
that should be before this body, and last night that was prevented. An 
up-or-down vote on McCain, who is supporting the surge, or a vote in 
opposition to the surge, the escalation sponsored by Warner and Levin--
that is the issue before this body today.

This is a diversion. This is a diversion. We finished the Super Bowl. 
This is a trick play by the Republicans. The real issue before this 
body is surge or no surge, escalation or no escalation. That is the 
debate the American people deserve.
