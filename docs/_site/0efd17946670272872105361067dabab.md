`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 24 January 2007`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for the purposes of debate only, I yield 
to my friend from California, the distinguished ranking member of the 
Committee on Rules, Mr. Dreier, 30 minutes; pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. And during consideration of this 
resolution, all time yielded is for the purposes of debate only.

Mr. Speaker, the rule before us provides 1 hour of general debate in 
the House equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking 
minority member on the Committee on Rules. The rule waives all points 
of order against consideration of the resolution and provides that the 
resolution shall be considered as read. The rule makes in order the 
amendment printed in the Rules report accompanying this resolution, if 
offered by Representative Kirk of Illinois or his designee. The 
amendment shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for 20 
minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an 
opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the 
question. The rule also waives all points of order against 
consideration of the amendment printed in the report, and contains one 
motion to recommit, which may not contain instructions. Finally, the 
rule provides that, notwithstanding the operation of the previous 
question, the Chair may postpone further consideration of the bill to a 
time designated by the Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, let me clearly state that there is no obligation for any 
Member to offer the amendment. The rule simply allows Mr. Kirk or his 
designee the option of offering this amendment if they choose to do so.

Also, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans were given the option to offer a 
substitute, and they declined.

This resolution will amend the House rules and allow the five 
Delegates who were elected to the House of Representatives to vote in 
the Committee of the Whole.

The Committee of the Whole is comprised of all Members of the House 
of Representatives, and is a procedural forum in which the House 
considers debates and votes on amendments to most of the legislation 
reported out of committee. After consideration of amendments in the 
Committee of the Whole, legislation is reported to the floor of the 
House for final consideration.

As we all know, Mr. Speaker, Delegates and Resident Commissioner have 
the same powers, rights and responsibilities as full Members of the 
House, with some exceptions. They cannot vote on the floor in the House 
or in the Committee of the Whole, they cannot offer a motion to 
reconsider, and they are not counted for quorum purposes.

Mr. Speaker, this resolution provides certain protections that have 
been ruled constitutional by Federal courts. Specifically, no Delegate 
or Resident Commissioner can provide the deciding margin of any 
amendment considered in the Committee of the Whole. In other words, if 
the vote in the Committee of the Whole is decided by five or fewer 
votes, it must be reconsidered immediately by the House of 
Representatives.

Let me state this clearly for all my colleagues. No Delegate or 
Resident Commissioner will provide the margin of victory or defeat of 
any amendment. It is that clear.

Delegates and the Resident Commissioner will not be able to vote on 
final passage, nor will they be able to vote on procedural motions.

Mr. Speaker, the Delegates and Resident Commissioner represent people 
who serve in our Armed Forces. Thirty thousand residents of Guam are 
military personnel. Over 2,400 soldiers from the territories and the 
District of Columbia are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan today, wars 
that this Chamber voted in favor of. American Samoa has the highest per 
capita casualty rate of any State or territory for the war in Iraq.

We believe that the people who fight and die wearing the uniform of 
the United States deserve to have their voices heard in the people's 
House.

Beyond that, Mr. Speaker, residents of all territories and the 
District of Columbia pay Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes under 
FICA. The people living in the territories and the District of Columbia 
deserve to have a voice in Congress, and their elected representatives, 
the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner, deserve to have a vote in 
the Committee of the Whole.

Mr. Speaker, while these voting privileges are in large part 
symbolic, and I, for one, believe that the District of Columbia, where 
people actually pay Federal taxes in addition to all the other 
contributions that they make to this country, deserve to have full 
voting rights in this Congress, but this is the least, I think, we can 
do to restore some modicum of representation to these millions of 
Americans, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and 
vote for the resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
