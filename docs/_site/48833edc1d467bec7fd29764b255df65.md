Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the men and women 
of the 386th Engineering Battalion and the Christus Spohn Healthcare 
System.

Since December 2006, members of the 386th Engineering Battalion have 
been working side-by-side with their civilian counterparts in the only 
level three trauma center in the Corpus Christi area. During their 
drill weekends, these soldiers are assigned to duties inside the 
hospital's emergency room to work in triage, fast track or trauma.

Through this joint effort, the 386th Engineering Battalion was able 
to utilize these real world experiences on the battlefields of Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

I would like to take some time now to honor Lt. Col. John Beignano 
and Lt. Col. Francisco Zuniga. These gentlemen worked tirelessly with 
the Christus Spohn Healthcare System administrators to make this idea a 
reality. By participating in this important work, these soldiers are 
making significant contributions to the community and to their fellow 
soldiers. Their families and loved ones should be proud of their 
service to the country and the extraordinary way they have improved 
people's lives.

Today, I ask that my colleagues join me in commemorating the men and 
women of the 386th Engineering Battalion and the Christus Spohn 
Healthcare System.
