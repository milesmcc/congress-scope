Mr. SESTAK. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Today our country faces significant labor shortages in occupations 
that are vital to our educational, health and, therefore, our national 
security.

I thank Chairman Miller and ranking member, Mr. McKeon, for their 
efforts to expand the professional areas of recognition where there is 
a national need which is critically important as we attempt to ensure 
an adequate workforce for services that are vital to all Americans.

In this vein, I believe the list of health occupations for which 
national need exists must also include physical therapists. Recent 
reports have shown that our country does not have an adequate number of 
physical therapists to meet our growing needs.

According to the American Hospital Association, therapists represent 
the occupation for which the greatest percentage of vacancies exist in 
our hospitals across our Nation, at an 11.4 percent vacancy rate. This 
is at a time when the demand for physical therapist employment is 
projected to grow 27 percent within 8 years, even as 58 percent of our 
hospitals are reporting in 2006 that therapist recruitment was more 
difficult than the year before. I, therefore, believe it is imperative 
we add physical therapists in the area of national need to ensure the 
Secretary of Education has direction to provide loan repayment to 
physical therapists.

Compounding this challenge of our national need for physical 
therapists exceeding our supply are already 31,000 servicemen and -
women who have returned home from the war in Afghanistan and Iraq to 
recover from wounds sustained in the service of their country.

Physical therapists will, therefore, continue to play an integral 
role in rehabilitating our Nation's veterans as they cope with injuries 
from the battlefield. To ensure the proper care and recovery of those 
who have sacrificed their well-being to protect us, we must address our 
shortage of physical therapists.

This amendment to include physical therapists as individuals in an 
occupation of national need, supported by the American Physical Therapy 
Association, is a necessary and practical measure to attract students 
to this profession. The loan repayment incentive of up to $10,000 for 
students who obtain a graduate degree in physical therapy which results 
from designating physical therapy as an area of national need will 
encourage more students to enter the profession and help alleviate 
these growing vacancies.

I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support this commonsense 
amendment that highlights this issue of utmost importance for everyone, 
but also including the veterans who are returning from our wars 
overseas.

I reserve the balance of my time.
