Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day today, this 
House will send our military a strong message, that we are going to 
provide them the equipment and the benefits that they so desperately 
need and deserve as they continue to fight two different wars in Iraq, 
and certainly in Afghanistan.

This legislation, Mr. Speaker, will help protect our troops on the 
battlefield by providing $4 billion for special vehicles, 
transportation, that is going to be used in these two wars.

At a time when our equipment is being worn out, the legislation also 
creates a Defense Readiness Production Board that will identify serious 
readiness issues and will then allow the board to address those issues 
through funds that are placed in a Strategic Readiness Funds.

In this House, we certainly have differences on how to proceed in 
Iraq, but we are united in ensuring that our troops are taken care of, 
both on the battlefield and here at home.

Let's support this bill today.
