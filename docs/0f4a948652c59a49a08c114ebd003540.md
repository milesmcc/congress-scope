# THE STATE OF THE UNION

`Mr. SMITH of Texas â€” 11 May 2010`

Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, here is the state of the Union:

Unemployment remains almost 10 percent. Sixteen million people have 
lost their jobs. Taxes are going up. The health care bill costs $300 
billion more than the American people were told. The Nation's deficit 
has doubled in the last year because of excessive government spending. 
Our foreign policy also has run a deficit. The world is a more 
dangerous place today. Iran is closer to making a nuclear bomb. We have 
insulted our allies--Western Europe and Israel. There is no victory in 
Iraq or Afghanistan.

It's time for a change all right. We need a bipartisan balance in 
Washington, not a one-party monopoly.
