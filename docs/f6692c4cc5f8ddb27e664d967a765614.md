`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 4 January 2007`

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a fallen 
soldier from Greenfield, IA, LCpl Clinton Jon (C.J.) Miller, who was 
killed while serving his country as part of an improvised explosive 
device detection team in Iraq. My thoughts and prayers go out to his 
wife Jackie, his mother Susan, his father Kerby, and all his family and 
friends. I am sure I speak for all Iowans when I say that I am proud to 
call C.J. one of us. By all accounts, he was a fine marine who felt 
called to, and liked, military service. Family members say that he 
joined the Marines during wartime because he just felt he had to serve. 
Where would our country be without patriotic young Americans like C.J. 
who feel a call to serve their country? All Americans owe a debt of 
gratitude to this brave Marine. As his father said, ''He was a hero.'' 
Lance Corporal Miller's tremendous service and sacrifice should never 
be forgotten.














Sergeant James P. Musack
