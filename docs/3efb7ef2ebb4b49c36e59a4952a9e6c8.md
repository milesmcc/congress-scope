`Ms. LEE â€” 10 May 2007`

Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Chairman Obey, first of all, for 
his strong and determined effort and his diligent effort to end this 
war. And, also, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. 
McGovern) for offering this bill.

H.R. 2237 does reflect the goals of what we call the Lee amendment, 
which was sponsored by Congresswomen Waters, Woolsey, Watson, and 
Clarke. But let me tell you the goal of this bill, as the goal of the 
Lee amendment really is an effort to fully fund the safe and timely 
redeployment of our troops from Iraq. It is responsible. It is 
practical. It does not cut the funding. But it designates what the 
supplemental can be used for, and that is to fully fund a safe 
withdrawal and redeployment and help the Iraqis stabilize their country 
with a diplomatic, social, and reconstruction effort.

Members of Congress now can choose between standing with the 
President or the American people who want an end to this occupation, or 
the President, as I said, who wants an open-ended commitment to this 
failed policy.

History will record that this war was a deadly mistake. History will 
document the damage that it has already done to our security and the 
security of the world, just as it already records the case for the war 
as fraudulent, something that we all would have known had the House 
approved my amendment in 2002 that would have allowed the United 
Nations inspectors to finish their job.

One day history will record that this unnecessary occupation ended. 
What remains to be seen is when it will end and at what cost in lives 
and treasure and what cost to our security and the security of the 
world.

For those Members who recognize that the President's policy is a 
failure but are concerned about voting to end this failed policy and to 
redeploy our troops, I have a question for you: At what point will you 
be comfortable with that vote? When the death toll hits 5,000 or 
10,000?

Please vote for this. Please vote to end this occupation and bring 
our young men and women home. Please stop the deaths.

We have already paid close to half a trillion dollars pursuing this 
failed policy.

Mr. Speaker, you cannot ''win'' an occupation, just as the United 
States cannot ''win'' an Iraqi civil war.

We know that there is no military solution to the situation in Iraq. 
Our generals have told us that. The fact is that, the presence of our 
troops, who are seen as an occupying force, enflames the very 
insurgency that they are asked to deal with.

In listening to this desperate rhetoric about ''surrender,'' and 
about ''defeat'' I am confident that history will look upon such 
remarks with the same ridicule that it reserves for the Vietnam war 
supporters discredited ''domino theory'' or the President's ''mission 
accomplished'' speech on the decks of the USS Abraham Lincoln, more 
than 4 years ago.

Today, members of Congress will decide what side of history they will 
be on. I urge them to stand with the American people and all those who 
recognize that there is no military solution to the situation in Iraq, 
and to vote for H.R. 2237, legislation to fully fund the safe and 
timely withdrawal of our troops from Iraq.
