Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in the wake of news that 
comes to us that the United States will now have as a policy in Iraq 
the arming of Sunni groups who have admittedly killed and maimed 
Americans. We have now reached the point of public-political lunacy.

Representative Paul, myself, Representative Jones and others have 
entered a bill for consideration of the House that will cause us to 
have to reauthorize this war. Any conceivable reason for having allowed 
the President to enter into this war with the enabling resolution that 
we passed has now been accomplished; any ''whereas,'' any ''be it 
resolved'' of that resolution is now moot.

In order for any of us to justify spending one more penny or 
committing one more soldier of the United States into this war, we have 
to have an up-or-down vote on whether it should be authorized.

Arming Sunni groups that have murdered U.S. service men and women as 
a policy, a strategy, is without merit and devoid of any political 
sensibility.
