Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
might consume.

Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in the 
consideration of H.R. 3297, which names the postal facility in 
Morrisville, Pennsylvania, after Nate DeTample.

H.R. 3297, which was introduced by Representative Patrick Murphy on 
August 1, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 
20, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire 
Pennsylvania congressional delegation.

Madam Speaker, Private First Class Nathaniel E. DeTample was killed 
on August 9, 2005, in an attack by small arms fire in Beiji, Iraq. The 
attack occurred while he was investigating a rocket-propelled grenade 
incident. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 111 Infantry Regiment, 
Pennsylvania Army National Guard in Philadelphia.

Private DeTample was a wrestler, an Eagle Scout, and a criminal 
justice major at Shippenburg University. He was deployed to Iraq in 
March 2005 for the purpose of performing stability and support 
operations in the Beiji area north of Baghdad. He served his country 
with honor and distinction.

And so, Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Murphy, 
for introducing this legislation, and urge its swift passage.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
