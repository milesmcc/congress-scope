Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I just returned on a codel from Baghdad, 
among other places, with four other Members, a bipartisan trip. I am 
proud to report that our troops are doing a marvelous job under the 
circumstances in which they have been placed.

To ride in a C-130 with American soldiers going into combat, seeing 
their faces and realizing that they were going into harm's way was 
very, very emotional; to ride in a Humvee with soldiers who faced an 
enemy that they didn't know who it was because friends and enemy look 
alike; and to be in the streets of Baghdad.

I was buoyed by the enthusiasm of our troops but know they are going 
to need help over the years with veterans benefits. We were in 
Landstuhl, Germany hospital today with a soldier who lost his leg on 
Friday. Continuing injuries will cause a continuing commitment from the 
American people and a continuing commitment to make sure that Iran does 
not exercise undue influence.

Prime Minister Maliki reasserted his desire to provide defense for 
his own country with help from America with equipment and not to have 
Iran interfere. I wasn't as extremely enthusiastic about what I saw in 
the country of Iraq, which has been ravaged, or their government, which 
needs much improvement.

But our troops are beyond reproach and they need our support.
