Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me simply say, in response to the comments 
from the gentleman, that given what he prefers to see in this bill on 
this subject, we are very lucky to have the 1-year fix at all because 
the White House opposed not only the long-term fix, but the short-term 
fix as well.

I would also point out that it was last year's Congress that allowed 
the program to expire in the first place and never managed to get 
around to finding the offsets that would have enabled the committee to 
provide this package long term.

So I recognize the legitimacy of the gentleman's concern, but I want 
to point out that I think that given the resistance of the White House 
to anything except money for the Iraqi operation and a tiny portion of 
our obligation for Katrina, with those two exceptions, the White House 
resisted every single effort made by us to deal with any problem, 
whether it was Western schools, whether it was kids getting knocked off 
health-care rolls, or whether it was the need to provide more veterans' 
health care. They fought it all.
