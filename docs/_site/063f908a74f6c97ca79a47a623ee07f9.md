Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor one of the bravest 
and most dedicated young heroes of North Texas and of our Nation.

Army Private Clarence Spencer was killed in Blad, Iraq while fighting 
against enemy forces in one of the most important conflicts our Nation 
has ever engaged in.

Clarence Spencer gallantly and selflessly gave his life for his 
country while fighting alongside his fellow soldiers of the First 
Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, Texas.

Private Spencer is survived by his mother, son and loving wife, Army 
Private Charlotte Spencer, who has also devoted herself to our Nation's 
noble military profession.

Clarence Spencer served three tours in Iraq, two of which were as a 
marine. Wounded in Iraq on a previous tour, he demonstrated tremendous 
courage by deploying into harm's way once again.

Private Clarence Spencer is gone, but he will never be forgotten. His 
memory lives on in our hearts and America is eternally grateful for his 
spirit and dedication.

As Clarence's Dunbar High School football coach said about him, 
''I've coached faster, stronger and more talented students, but I've 
never coached anyone that I was more proud of.''

That is precisely the way that the Fort Worth community and our 
Nation feel about soldiers such as Private Clarence Spencer--a true 
American hero.
