Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
exercise the power Congress has under article I of the Constitution and 
to override the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance 
Program. This vote is significant because it underlines the difference 
between what the President values and what the American people value. 
To the President and his allies in Congress, $190 billion this year for 
the occupation in Iraq is a necessity. But $35 billion to provide 
health care to 10 million uninsured children in America is an 
extravagance.

If we are successful and we override that veto tomorrow, SCHIP will 
preserve the coverage of 11,892 children in my home State of New 
Hampshire and make funds available to cover an additional 8,720 kids. 
If we are not successful, I personally would like to invite President 
Bush and his allies in Congress to come home with me to Concord, New 
Hampshire, and explain to these 20,000 kids why they can't go to a 
doctor when they break a bone or get medicine when they are sick.
