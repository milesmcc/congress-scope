Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today I rise strong support 
of H. Con. Res. 185. I join the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Walz in 
offering this resolution. Our entire State joins together in welcoming 
home the 2,600 members of the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Brigade 
Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division who recently returned from Iraq.

During the 22-month deployment of the 
1/34th BCT, these courageous citizen soldiers served Minnesota and our 
Nation with honor and dignity. Their service frequently put them in 
harm's way, and we are grateful for their safe return to their 
families. Since the war in Iraq began our friends, families and 
neighbors who serve in the National Guard and Reserves have seen their 
dual roles as citizen soldiers expand as they have been called to serve 
in deployments across the world even as they continue the most 
important mission of all, protecting us in our communities here at 
home.

The men and women of the 1/34th have demonstrated an exceptional 
commitment to our country--a commitment to serve and a willingness to 
sacrifice in combat operations. Their 22-month activation in Iraq was 
the longest tour of any military unit to have served in Iraq thus far. 
These Minnesota soldiers have completed some of the most grueling 
combat assignments. We should also pause to remember the brave members 
of this unit who made the ultimate sacrifice during their deployment. 
Their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.

My office stands ready to assist all military personnel and their 
families. I believe strongly that our Federal Government must keep its 
promise to all those who have served. Providing the necessary 
healthcare, education, and disability benefits to meet the needs of our 
veterans is both a responsibly and a moral obligation.

Regardless of where individuals stand on the issues that face this 
Nation in Iraq we all must continue to support the men and women who 
volunteer to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces all around the world.

As we welcome home members of the 
1/34th, we must also keep in our thoughts and prayers the many active 
duty military personnel, Reservists and Minnesota Guard members who 
continue to serve in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and 
elsewhere around the world. I commend each and every one of them for 
their strength, courage and dedication.

I would like to thank my colleague from Minnesota, Mr. Walz, for 
bringing this important resolution to the House floor, and for his 
service to this country. I commend members of the Minnesota National 
Guard's 1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division.
