Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I come to 
the House floor today to congratulate a small business in Monticello--a 
growing community in Minnesota's Sixth District.

Ultra Machining Company (UMC) was recently 1 of 5 companies 
nationally to receive the prestigious Secretary of Defense Employer 
Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) Freedom Award.

The Award was created to recognize employers who provide exceptional 
support to their employees serving in the National Guard and Reserve. 
It's the highest in a series of ESGR awards.

Sergeant Lou Jacobson, who works at UMC and recently returned from a 
22-month deployment in Iraq, nominated UMC for the Freedom Award.

Jacobson wrote, ''UMC has made up the difference in my pay while I am 
deployed. Last summer, a storm knocked down our fence. UMC put out a 
sign up sheet and the next Saturday 40 of my co-workers showed up at my 
house . . . UMC paid for all the materials. They said that is what 
family does, they help.''

Madam Speaker, family does help. Minnesota helps. Americans help. 
Congratulations and thanks go to Terry and Mary Tomann--founders of 
UMC, all the employees of UMC and Sergeant Lou Jacobson for his service 
to our country and for letting all Americans know what it means to be 
family.
