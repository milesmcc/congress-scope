Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the threat 
posed by Iran, but I voted against the amendment offered by Senators 
Kyl and Lieberman because it could be interpreted as an authorization 
to keep U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely to police the Iraqi civil war 
and engage in a proxy war with Iran. Maintaining a significant U.S. 
troop presence in Iraq is undermining our ability to deter Iran as it 
increases its influence in Iraq, becomes bolder in its nuclear 
aspirations, and continues to support Hezbollah. The administration 
needs to end its myopic focus on Iraq and develop comprehensive, 
effective strategies for dealing with Iran and the other serious 
challenges we face around the world.

Mr. President, I voted against Senator Biden's amendment because, 
while we should support a comprehensive political settlement in Iraq, 
the U.S. Government shouldn't tell the Iraqi people how to run their 
country.
