Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on Monday I spoke on this floor about a 
conflict I had in supporting this measure because I want peace in our 
world and I want our troops to come home. I asked for my constituents 
to let me know how they felt.

Hundreds of people responded with e-mails and phone calls, and I 
appreciate each of them. They want us to support our troops. They want 
to bring our troops home from Iraq, and they want to take care of our 
veterans.

The most effective way to accomplish those things is to vote for this 
bill. This will be the first step in ending the war in Iraq, taking 
care of our veterans, but at the same time, supporting our troops.

I am proud to be a Member of this Congress and to vote ''aye'' today 
on this bill.
