# SENATE ALL-NIGHTER
## `d22504a700d5ecfaafdfb7ca0c11ce37`
`Mr. PITTS â€” 19 July 2007`

Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I am sure we have all seen the images on 
the evening news and in this week's papers.

Cots laid out in the Capitol's hallways to provide for an all-night 
debate on Iraq. Oh, the plight of the modern day United States Senator.

What a decision to make. Sleep on a leather couch in a Capitol 
hideaway, or bunk up in the LBJ Room on a turned-down rollaway. We 
appreciate these good Senators' tough sacrifice, but how about our 
troops in the field?

While Senators are trying to get some shut-eye between rhetorical 
battles on the Senate floor, our soldiers are getting no sleep while 
dodging real bullets in combat.

Consider one 22-year-old Marine's comment to a reporter about life in 
Iraq--''If I get five minutes to close my eyes, I take it.''

Another Staff Sgt. said ''The 45-minute cat-nap is worth a million 
bucks. Getting some is better than none.''

Let the debate go forward, but spare our troops who are sleeping in 
the sand and dirt the indignity of this political theater.
