`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 21 July 2010`

Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, extending help to the unemployed is the right thing to 
do. It's the decent thing to do. We should have done it a long time 
ago. My colleagues on the Republican side have frustrated attempt after 
attempt after attempt after attempt to extend these benefits to people, 
most of whom have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.

My friends on the other side of the aisle say, well, we can't afford 
to do it, that we need to pay for this, even though they are emergency 
benefits. Well, why don't we pay for the Bush tax cuts, which added 
hundreds of billions of dollars to our debt? Why don't we pay for the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, all funded through borrowed money? Why is 
nation building in Afghanistan more important than our own people? Why 
is giving Donald Trump another tax cut that is unpaid for, that adds to 
our deficit, more important than helping those who are unemployed?

I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, What are you 
thinking? Why don't you care? Whose side are you on? I urge my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle to leave the Beltway every 
once in a while and go back and talk to your own constituents, and you 
will see that people are struggling, that there are people who are 
suffering because of this economy.

This is a difficult economy that is slowly but surely beginning to 
recover. It is a difficult economy that President Obama inherited from 
George W. Bush. We are trying to dig ourselves out of this mess that my 
Republican friends have created. It's going to take time. I remind my 
friends on the other side of the aisle that when George Bush was 
President we were losing an average of nearly 750,000 jobs per month in 
the last 3 months of the administration.



Twenty-two consecutive months of job losses, that's what they gave 
us.

When they talk about the deficit, I remind them that President Bill 
Clinton left George W. Bush a record surplus that they squandered on 
tax cuts for the rich and two wars that were unpaid for.

And, you know, the reason why we talk about President Bush's record 
is because the head of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, 
Pete Sessions, when asked what the Republican plan was, he said, We 
need to go back to the exact same agenda: the exact same agenda that 
produced these record deficits, the exact same agenda that put millions 
of people in this country out of work. Now, I've heard a lot of scary 
things in this Chamber, but I've got to tell you, that is the scariest 
thing I've ever heard.

I don't want to go backwards. I don't want to go back to the time 
where we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs per month. President 
Obama to his credit and the Democratic Congress here are trying to fix 
the mess that they created, and we are now beginning to see job 
increases in this country. Not as much as we want, but we're moving in 
the right direction.

But in the meantime, we cannot turn our backs on those who are 
unemployed. So I say to my Republican friends in the United States 
Senate, stop your obstructionism. Stop playing politics with 
unemployment benefits and move out of the way and allow this bill to 
move forward so we can vote on it here on the House floor.
