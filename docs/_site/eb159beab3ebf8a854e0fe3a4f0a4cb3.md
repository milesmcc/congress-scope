`Mr. BOUSTANY â€” 9 April 2008`

Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my friend. That is very compelling.

I had a similar situation back in August when we went to Fallujah, 
and I want to pay tribute to General Walter Gaskin, because he was on 
the ground, a Marine general, implementing this plan through Fallujah. 
They used their resources strategically to reach out to these sheiks 
and local leaders and tribal leaders, and it made all the difference in 
the world.

I remember loading up in an MRAP with him in a convey. We drove into 
Fallujah, and it was the most remarkable thing I have done since I have 
been a Congressman, because just weeks before, General Gaskin told us 
you couldn't go down this road without hitting an IED or getting shot 
at.

So we drove around some of the streets of Fallujah and then we got 
out and walked. And we walked four or five blocks to a joint security 
station with our marines and with the Iraqi police. And the first 
marine I came up to at the security station happened to be from 
my district in Abbeville, and we traded stories and talked about good 
Cajun food and all that. But I sure was proud of him. I called his 
parents when I got back and we talked.


You know, it just makes you feel good knowing these young men and 
women are just dedicated and they are doing what they have to do, and 
they are the best that humanity has to offer. I agree with you, Judge.

Then we met with the precinct police colonel who was so proud of the 
efforts, and he showed us how much success they had had because they 
were implementing Iraqi solutions to the security in Fallujah. And now 
Fallujah is growing. The population is coming back. Businesses are 
opening.

I walked into a small shop and met a shopkeeper with his young son 
and talked with them through a translator. We handed out candy to 
children in the streets. We encountered a group of young children 
playing soccer in the streets, another group of adolescents and young 
men playing volleyball, and it was quite a remarkable scene to 
experience. So I had a similar situation, and it is really a tribute to 
our men and women who are down there on the ground doing this job.
