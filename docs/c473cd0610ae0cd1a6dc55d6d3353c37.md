# SERGEANT JAMIE O. MAUGANS POST OFFICE BUILDING
## `c473cd0610ae0cd1a6dc55d6d3353c37`
`Mr. TIAHRT â€” 12 February 2008`

---


Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the gentleman from 
North Carolina for carrying this bill and also the gentleman from 
Connecticut for yielding to me and for the great job he's doing here in 
the House of Representatives.

Mr. Speaker, I am also honored to have to carry this bill. And, 
today, Congress has the honor to approve the bill, naming the post 
office in Derby, Kansas, after a true American hero, SGT Jamie O'Dell 
Maugans.

Sergeant Maugans was the first casualty of the global war on terror 
from the 4th District of Kansas, a district that has experienced 12 
casualties in this war. A Derby native, Sergeant Maugans graduated from 
Derby High School and attended Cowley County Community College and the 
University of Kansas before joining the Army.

When the terrorists attacked our Nation on September 11, 2001, Jamie 
was serving as an ordnance disposal specialist stationed in San Diego, 
California. Shortly after those attacks, he was deployed in Afghanistan 
in connection with Operation Enduring Freedom. On April 15, 2002, while 
disposing of ordnance near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Sergeant Maugans was 
killed.

The explosion also took the lives of three other soldiers, including 
fellow Kansan, SSG Justin Galewski from Olathe. Jamie was only 27 years 
old.

Sergeant Maugans left behind a loving family and friends in Kansas. I 
know his mother, Kathy Wurdeman, and his father, Bryce Maugans, his 
step-mother, Mary Maugans, and his brother and four sisters are very 
proud of Jamie and his service to this country. I am honored to have 
worked with the Maugans family and the Derby community on this effort.

Although this bill names the Derby Post Office building after 
Sergeant Maugans, this endeavor is not only a way to honor Jamie, but a 
way to honor all those from Kansas who have died in defense of this 
Nation from radical Muslims.

As the first casualty from my district, Jamie's life and memory are a 
representation of all those who have lost their lives in the global war 
on terror. I hope this effort will be a reminder to everyone in south 
central Kansas of the sacrifice that so many veterans have made for our 
country and our freedoms.

Let me take just a few moments to read the names of all those from 
the 4th District of Kansas who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan so 
that their sacrifice is honored:

SGT Jerry W. Mills, Jr., from Arkansas City, Kansas, died on November 
29, 2005.

SGT Evan S. Parker, also from Arkansas City, died on October 26, 
2005.

SGT Alexander J. Funcheon from Bel Aire died on April 29, 2007.

PFC Class Ryan R. Cox from Derby died on June 15, 2001.

SPC Joseph F. Herndon II, also from Derby, died on July 29, 2004.

SPC Dustin K. McGaugh from Derby died on September 30, 2001.

SGT Willsun Mock from Harper died on October 22, 2006.

PFC Chad E. Marsh from Wichita died on February 17, 2007.

And 1SG Timmy J. Millsap from Wichita died on April 25, 2005.

In addition, at this time I will submit a statement for the Record 
and include all the names of Kansans who have died in the global war on 
terror.

Mr. Speaker, below are the names of the fallen heroes from Kansas who 
have died in the global war on terror. These brave men paid the 
ultimate sacrifice in service to a grateful Nation. Although we are 
naming the post office after one of their comrades, I hope this effort 
honors all those who have died in defense of America.
