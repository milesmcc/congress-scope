Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me just say thank you to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. Tauscher) for putting forth this bill, which I 
believe will take a significant step forward in ending this occupation 
in Iraq.

This administration professes to care about our troops, so let me 
tell you, why have about 250,000 of our troops served more than one 
tour? Tell me this, why have tours in Iraq been extended for all active 
duty Army soldiers from 12 months to 15 months?

I will tell you why. This administration, after nearly 5 years, 
nearly half a trillion dollars, and nearly 3,700 brave American lives, 
is willing to sacrifice the health and safety of our troops and the 
security of our Nation in a last-ditch effort to save face for its 
failed policies in Iraq.

Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. The price is simply too high. The 
least we can do is give our troops this badly needed break. That's the 
least we can do.

I congratulate Congresswoman Tauscher for this legislation and urge 
my colleagues to support it. Our troops need this, and both sides of 
the aisle should vote for this in a bipartisan fashion.
