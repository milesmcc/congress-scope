Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I join with my senior colleague from 
Iowa, Senator Grassley, in introducing a bill to name the Marshalltown 
Post Office in honor of MAJ Scott Nisely, who was killed in action in 
Iraq on September 30, 2006.

Major Nisely enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1981 and served in 
Operation Desert Storm. In 1994, he moved to Marshalltown, IA, with his 
family and worked at the Iowa Veterans Home as well as at the 
Marshalltown and Des Moines Post Offices. Because of his love for his 
country and the military, Major Nisely took a demotion to join the Iowa 
National Guard and was sent to Iraq in 2005.

Major Nisely was a dedicated husband and father, beloved for his 
sense of humor and positive attitude. Having served in Operation Desert 
Storm, he was already a respected Marine veteran and a hero to his 
family and friends. But with our Armed Forces engaged in Iraq, he once 
again felt compelled to fight for his country. Major Nisely served in 
two wars, set a sterling example of selfless service to country, and 
paid the ultimate price while fighting in Iraq. I am proud to join my 
colleague in naming the post office in Marshalltown the Major Scott 
Nisely Post Office, in honor of this fallen hero.
