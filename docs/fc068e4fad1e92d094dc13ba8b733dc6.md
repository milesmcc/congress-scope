Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from 
Alabama, a member of the committee. He is a very strong voice. I only 
add to your observations, which are very accurate about the situation 
in Iraq, we all share a concern about the worsening situation in 
Afghanistan, and that will become General Petraeus's top 
responsibility. We are fortunate that he is eminently qualified and has 
studied the culture of the region, having understood the complexity, 
the geopolitical situation with regard to Pakistan and Iran. He is 
eminently qualified to step in and be the commander of those forces in 
that region.
