Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we need a surge of congressional action to 
stop George Bush's disastrous policy in Iraq. The country needs and is 
desperate for a change in policy in Iraq, and tonight President George 
Bush will continue his policy of failure, of giving us just more of the 
same.

It is clear that we need to insist on a political solution in Iraq 
rather than to insist on Americans continuing to pour billions of 
dollars and thousands of lives into this political chaos in Iraq. The 
President has refused to listen to the bipartisan panel calling for a 
change in Iraq. He has refused to listen to the American people. But he 
cannot refuse to listen to a Congress that fulfills its obligation 
under the Constitution to exercise the power of the purse to stop this 
misguided escalation.

The U.S. House should vote in clear and no uncertain terms to fund 
the troops that are there and to cut off funding for any escalation. It 
is our constitutional obligation. It is a commonsense policy to insist 
on Iraqis standing up. That is the direction and the change we need in 
this country.
