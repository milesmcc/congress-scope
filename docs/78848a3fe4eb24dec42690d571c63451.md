Mr. MURTHA. I rise in opposition to the amendment. I am trying to 
figure out what the gentleman is trying to do. This was in the table 
from the White House, from the administration, the Defense Department. 
This would delete $160 million in drug interdiction and counter-drug 
activities which go to Mexico, Afghanistan and Colombia. The Defense 
Department has the authority to train and equip foreign governments for 
counter-drug activities since Congress enacted section 1004 of the '91 
National Defense Authorization Act. This funding will enable the 
Department of Defense to provide digital communication equipment to our 
allies in order to fight the increasing drug trade and execute this 
funding at the discretion of the Department of Defense.

I mean, I can't imagine anything that's more important to us and our 
troops in Afghanistan than the amount of money that we're putting in 
for anti-drug interdiction. So I would urge the Members to vote against 
this amendment.

I yield back the balance of my time.
