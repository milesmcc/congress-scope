Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend for his willingness to always sit down 
and try to work things out. The roadblock here to our proceeding will 
be either kept in place or removed tomorrow with the vote on whether to 
allow Levin-Reed to come to a vote. The Senator is right that there 
have been times when people have filibustered matters. There have been 
times when they have decided not to. On the Iraq issue, on the last 
authorization bill, there were votes up or down without a 60-vote 
procedural roadblock being put in place to the then Levin-Reed and 
Kerry amendments. So that is the precedent we established last year 
that I would hope the Republican leader would allow to be followed, 
because--one other comment--I can't think of a more appropriate place 
to be debating Iraq policy, frankly, than on an authorization bill. 
Whether I am right or wrong, that is what happened last year. I hope it 
will again be followed this year.

I thank my good friend. My remarks will be coming this afternoon.

Senator Kennedy will be following the Senator from Arizona.
