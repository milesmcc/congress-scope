Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today in 
celebration of the 90th birthday of a truly remarkable Vermonter, 
Antonio ''Tony'' Pomerleau.

When Tony was 3 years old, he fell down a flight of stairs, injuring 
himself so seriously that he was forced to wear an iron corset and 
doctors said he wouldn't make it past his 12th birthday. Clearly, Tony 
saw things differently, and today, on his 90th birthday, we express our 
deep appreciation for all that he has given to our state.

As an entrepreneur, police chief, philanthropist, and community 
leader, from his service as a trustee at St. Michael's College to his 
annual Christmas dinner party for underprivileged children, Tony has 
positively influenced the lives of thousands of Vermonters.

Tony's entrepreneurial spirit shone through at an early age when he 
would sell haircuts, wash cars, and help in his family's store. In 
1942, he bought a failing grocery store. Three years later, he had not 
only turned that grocery store around, he owned three more stores and a 
wholesale beverage business.

In 1951, he entered real estate. He built the Ethan Allen Shopping 
Plaza, the first shopping center in Vermont. Today, ''Pomerleau Real 
Estate'' is a household name across Vermont.

But Tony's skill in business is more than matched by his generosity 
of spirit. Tony is perhaps most well known for his annual Christmas 
dinners which he started in 1982. In 2004, he expanded the tradition, 
hosting a party for the families of Vermont Guardsmen and women 
deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In addition, he served for many years as a trustee at St. Michael's 
College, has endowed scholarships at Rice Memorial High School, and 
been a leading supporter of the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and 
the United Way of Chittenden County.

As the Burlington Free Press, our state's largest newspaper, said it 
so well in naming Tony the 2006 Vermonter of the Year, ''Everyone has a 
seat at Tony Pomerleau's table.''

Thank you Tony, for all that you do to make Vermont such a wonderful 
place, and congratulations on a very special birthday.
