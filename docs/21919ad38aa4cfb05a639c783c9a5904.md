Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am very surprised there was 
an objection to that recommendation. After all, we are just trying to 
find some way to get the President's original recommendations up here 
so that the Commander in Chief can support our troops so that they can 
come home as quickly as possible. In Afghanistan, whether we believe it 
or not, the war on al Qaeda involves our future freedom, and certainly 
it would have a significant impact upon peace in the world.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
