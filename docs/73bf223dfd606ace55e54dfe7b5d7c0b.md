`Mr. DeMINT â€” 13 March 2008`

---


Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the 
Chamber, I bring this Semper Fi amendment to the floor as a promise to 
a number of marines and their families. I admit this is somewhat 
unusual, but this amendment is not about free speech.

In Berkeley, CA, there were some folks protesting the Marine 
Recruitment Office. They have their right to protest, to speak out. My 
case is against the city of Berkeley, which incited hate against our 
marines and encouraged them to disrupt recruitment, which is their 
Federal responsibility.

This is a terrible precedent for a local government to take a 
position against our constitutional role to defend our Nation, which 
requires recruitment.

The things that were said by the city council about our marines were 
disgraceful. What we are proposing is to make a point. The earmarks 
that are talked about that went to Berkeley, over $2 million worth of 
earmarks, should not have gone there anyway, and they do involve 
special gourmet-type meals for the schools and money to the University 
of California at Berkeley, where they already have a $3.3 million 
endowment.

We can argue about the earmarks all night, but I am trying to make a 
point on behalf of marines and everyone in uniform that it is not the 
role of city or State governments to try to disgrace and intimidate, 
embarrass--whatever--our marines who are doing what we ask them to do.

So my amendment takes away those $2 million worth of earmarks as a 
symbol to every local government that may want to take on our Federal 
role and try to make an issue with our marines.

Semper Fi means ''Always Faithful.'' It is the motto of our marines. 
They are always faithful to us, and I promised many of their families, 
when I was in Iraq and back here, that I would stand up for them. I 
encourage all my colleagues to vote for this amendment to make a point.
