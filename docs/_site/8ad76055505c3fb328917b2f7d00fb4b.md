`Mr. REID â€” 3 April 2008`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, progress in this body is sometimes very hard 
to come by, but progress has been made. I appreciate Senator Kennedy 
coming to the floor. As those of us who have such affection and love 
for him know, once in a while he raises his voice. As a result of 
raising his voice, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45 p.m. today, the 
Senate proceed to vote on the adoption of S. Res. 501, honoring the 
sacrifice of the members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have been killed 
in Iraq and Afghanistan; that upon adoption of the resolution, the 
preamble be agreed to, with no intervening action of our debate; and 
that no amendments be in order to the resolution or the preamble.
