Mr. GRAHAM. I asked General Petraeus that very question. He said that 
anytime Muslims would take up arms against al-Qaida, it is marching 
toward the solution America has been seeking. I think General Petraeus, 
myself, and Senators Kyl and Lieberman understand this war is not just 
about killing terrorists; this is about supporting moderation where you 
can find it, isolating the elements within the region.

If you had to put a list of extreme elements together, al-Qaida would 
be at the top. To those men and women who have participated in the 
surge and stood by the Anbar Iraqis who turned on al-Qaida, I think you 
have made our country safer. To the Iraqis who took up arms against al-
Qaida, I think you have made Iraq safer and the world safer.

Mr. President, my question back to the Senator from Arizona, if I 
may, is, from his understanding of what was said yesterday, what can 
the Congress do, rather than criticize, what constructively can we do 
as a body to support those in harm's way and make sure we leave Iraq 
with a successful outcome?
