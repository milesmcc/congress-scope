Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Skelton's 
outstanding work on the underlying bill and also to support that 
portion of the en bloc amendment which sets up a mental health 
screening demonstration project cosponsored by Congresswoman DeLauro, 
Congressman McMahon of New York and myself.

This is an issue which addresses probably the most concerning issue 
that Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, spoke to the Armed 
Services Committee about, which is the stress levels of our troops who 
have been repeatedly deployed in military conflict. General Odierno had 
a number of us over in December. Again, his number one concern was the 
uncomfortable and outrageous amount of suicides which is occurring in 
theater. I was with General Bagby in Europe a couple of weeks ago, who 
again stated that that is the biggest challenge facing our Armed Forces 
in Europe, who, again, are made up of many troops who have served in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. And the present system of screening for returning 
troops is simply to fill out a questionnaire. That is not enough.

This amendment will set up a demonstration project with a face-to-
face evaluation with a mental health professional. This is the type of 
process that we need to deal with this unprecedented challenge.

Again, I urge strong support for the en bloc amendment which includes 
this important component.
