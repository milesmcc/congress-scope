`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 8 May 2007`

---


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I pay tribute 
today to a young man from Iowa who gave his life in service to his 
country. PFC Brian A. Botello was killed on April 29, 2007, while 
serving in Iraq as part of the 3rd Squadron, 61st Cavalry Regiment, 2nd 
Infantry Division. My prayers go out to his mother Karyn, in Alta, IA, 
and his father Tony in Michigan. They can be proud of their son's 
honorable service and the tremendous sacrifice he made for his country. 
All Americans owe a debt of gratitude to Brian Botello. His memory will 
live on along those other patriots who have laid down their lives for 
the cause of freedom.

I know that Brian's loss will be felt particularly deeply in the 
small town of Alta where he grew up. I know that flags have been flown 
at half mast and everyone from his neighbors to classmates from high 
school to members of his church are sharing stories and grieving as 
they remember Brian. I hope that they are able to take comfort in the 
fact that Brian Botello died honorably as an American patriot and he is 
now in a better place.
