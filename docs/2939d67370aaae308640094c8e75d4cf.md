`Mr. WOLF â€” 2 August 2007`

Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I went to the Rules Committee yesterday for 
the fourth time since January asking that my amendment be made in order 
to allow the House to discuss and vote on the recommendations of the 
bipartisan Iraq Study Group as the way forward in Iraq.

For the fourth time this year, the Rules Committee said no. I can 
only assume from that action that the Democrat leadership instead 
prefers to continue to lock down the House and deny the opportunity to 
take the bipartisan road on Iraq policy.

On the question of finding solutions in Iraq, this House cannot 
continue to just blindly follow the White House or the leadership of 
the Congress.

The Washington Post has editorialized that the debate on Iraq in 
recent weeks is all about political gamesmanship. Every member in this 
House knows that's true and that is what's been going on here. More 
importantly, I believe that the American people know what's going on. 
Just look at the polls on where Congress stands.

We owe it to the men and women in our armed forces who are putting 
their lives on the line every day in Iraq to at least take the time to 
discuss the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group.



We also owe it to their families.

We need to have a honest, true debate on the recommendations of the 
Iraq Study Group.

To not vote on the recommendations of such a distinguished group that 
took over eight months looking at this issue and talking to dozens of 
military officers, regional experts, academics, journalists and high-
level government officials from America and abroad just doesn't make 
sense. Take a look at the Iraq Study Group report for the extensive 
lists of those who advised the ISG, including the military senior 
advisor panel--retired Navy Admiral James O. Ellis, Jr., retired Army 
General John M. Keane, retired Army General Edward C. Meyer, retired 
Air Force General Joseph W. Ralston, and retired Army Lt. General Roger 
C. Schultz, Sr.

As I have said time and time again, the Iraq Study Group is the way 
forward and what I believe is the best and most appropriate way to be 
successful in Iraq.

It was bipartisan and all of its 79 recommendations were unanimous.

Two of its members--Lee Hamilton, the co-chair, and Leon Panetta--
served in this body. Two others--Alan Simpson and Chuck Robb--served in 
the Senate.

Co-chair Jim Baker and Lawrence Eagleburger served as secretary of 
State.

Bill Perry was President Clinton's secretary of Defense.

Bob Gates served on the panel for seven months--stepping down to 
become the current secretary of Defense.

H.R. 2574, the Iraq Study Group Recommendation Implementation Act of 
2007, which was the basis of the amendment I asked to be made in order 
under the bill we are debating today, has 59 cosponsors--34 Republicans 
and 25 Democrats.

We all know the war has created a bitter divide in our country. The 
ISG allows us to come together.

I will say it again: the best way forward is for both the Congress 
and the president to embrace the recommendations of the Iraq Study 
Group.

 Mr. Speaker, in the final analysis, it comes down to doing the right 
thing. The question is, when will the leadership in Congress show the 
courage that the American people expect and do the right thing--not for 
me or for the members of this House, but for the thousands of brave men 
and women serving in uniform, their families and the good of our 
country?
