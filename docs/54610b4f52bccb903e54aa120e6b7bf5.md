Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Florida, for his comments 
in support of this legislation. And I do also want to thank the 
gentlelady, the good Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, for her 
authorship to this bill. Thirty-two billion dollars is no pennies 
certainly to be given some sense of responsibility in knowing where the 
American taxpayers' money has gone in terms of the appropriations and 
the funding that we've given to Afghanistan and as well as to any other 
country, for that matter.

So again, I really commend the gentlelady, the good Senator from 
Maine, Senator Collins, for her authorship of this bill, and I thank my 
good friend from Florida also in helping us manage this bill on the 
floor.
