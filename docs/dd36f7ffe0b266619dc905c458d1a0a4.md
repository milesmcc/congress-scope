Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, the President said that critics of escalation 
have a responsibility, quite frankly, to offer an alternative. Today, 
Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, Congresswoman Maxine Waters and myself will 
do just that. The Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty 
Restoration Act is a rational alternative to escalation. It will repeal 
the authorization to use force, fully fund a 6-month withdrawal of U.S. 
forces from Iraq, provide economic aid to the Iraqi Government and 
fully fund the VA health care system for all veterans.

It will also prohibit permanent military bases in Iraq and U.S. 
control over Iraq's oil resources, and it will create a joint 
bipartisan committee to investigate how our Nation came to be misled 
into this unnecessary war and ensure that it never happens again.

It is time to bring this war and occupation to an end. It is time for 
military measures to be replaced by diplomacy. It is time to take the 
targets off our troops' backs and bring them home now. I am proud to 
say that today we will be introducing legislation to do just that.

I want to thank Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, Congresswoman Maxine 
Walters of the Progressive Caucus and the Out of Iraq Caucus for their 
leadership.
