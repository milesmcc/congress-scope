Mr. KING of Iowa. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentlewoman.

I'd add a piece that I want to reiterate here. Madam Speaker, if 
America is not moved enough at this pro-abortion activism and this 
legal distortion that has taken place as a matter of the professional 
actions and the public record of Dawn Johnsen, the President's nominee 
to head up the Office of Legal Counsel, they should be concerned about 
our national security. A national security that would say turn the 
Gitmo detainees loose or bring them here to the United States, put them 
under U.S. courts, and then, by the way, turn them loose and nurture 
them with our tax dollars so they can get on their feet again. All of 
that being part of this concept. But also Dawn Johnsen's objecting to 
surveillance of al Qaeda communications when it was a phone call that 
took place from a foreign country like, let's say, Afghanistan and 
ended up in Pakistan. If Osama bin Laden was calling Khalid Sheik 
Mohammed and if that nexus came back to the United States for the link 
but no one set foot in the United States, she would object to their not 
getting a warrant to listen in on that traffic on a telephone signal 
that would originate in Afghanistan and terminate in Pakistan.


Here is what she said. She attributed that type of surveillance to 
''an extreme and implausible Commander in Chief theory.''

Now, this is an implausible and extreme theory, Madam Speaker, but 
the Commander in Chief is not a theory. It's constitutional. It's 
strictly defined in the Constitution. The Commander in Chief of our 
Armed Forces is the President of the United States. And the President 
of the United States has nominated Dawn Johnsen, who is a radical 
extremist. And her nomination is in trouble, and 62 of us wrote a 
letter and said please pull the nomination.

The President, if I were standing before him, I would make such a 
plea, and I would entreat the President of the United States that the 
juice is not worth the squeeze. There are plenty of activists that are 
traipsing through the White House these days. This is a lightning rod 
activist. Why don't you give us somebody that's not such a lightning 
rod, maybe somebody that's not going to be quite so radical. You're 
going to have to appoint somebody there to make these legal opinions, 
and I would like to have somebody that understands what's 
constitutional, at least recognize that the President of the United 
States is Commander in Chief, that constitutional position.

I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.
