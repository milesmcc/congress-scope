Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, through a hailstorm of political attacks that 
continue on the floor of the Congress this morning, last week, 
America's two lead men in Iraq brought news to this Congress which 
should be welcome to every American family.

Despite the lack of political progress at the national level in Iraq, 
the military surge is working. And because the surge is working, our 
troops can start coming home.

I urge every American to tune out the rhetoric in Washington, D.C. 
and read the report. But don't just read the testimony of General David 
Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker; read the recent report issued by 
the more liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. In each case, our men 
and that liberal think tank found civilian deaths are down. Sunni 
leaders are cooperating with U.S. forces, and al Qaeda is on the run in 
Baghdad and Anbar province. These independent assessments should be 
read by every American, and every American should be encouraged; for 
even to a war-weary Nation, I say, if we do not grow weary in doing 
well, freedom will prevail in Iraq.
