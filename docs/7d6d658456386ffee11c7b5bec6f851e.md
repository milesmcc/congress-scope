Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, today Congress will send President 
Bush an emergency war supplemental that finally begins moving this war 
in a new direction.

Four years ago today, the Bush administration sent out a message of 
''Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq. But our mission was not accomplished. 
Instead, for 4 years, the President has stumbled, and past Republican 
Congresses refused to hold the administration accountable for its 
miscues and mistakes. Well, those days are over now.

Our legislation brings real accountability to the war. It provides 
accountability to our soldiers who were sent into battle without proper 
equipment or a clear mission. It provides accountability to our 
veterans who are not getting the best medical care when they come home, 
and to our military that is stretched to the limits by the current Bush 
war policy. And it finally holds the Iraqi government accountable to 
meet the benchmarks the President has created.

Madam Speaker, the American people want this war to move in a new 
direction. The President should sign the bill today.
