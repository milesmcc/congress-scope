Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise before you today to honor 
the life of Cpl Jonathan Daniel Porto, who died honorably serving his 
country as a part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

Corporal Porto enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in March 2008. An 
honor graduate from Paris Island, he received two meritorious 
promotions. Corporal Porto served as a Small Arms Repair Technician and 
was assigned under 1st Battalion 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine 
Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

In March 2010, at the age of 26, Corporal Porto was killed in action 
while supporting combat operations in the Helmand province of southern 
Afghanistan. For his superior leadership skills, Porto was promoted to 
Corporal in December 2009.

His awards include the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, National Defense 
Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and NATO 
International Security Assistance Force Medal.

I commend Corporal Porto for his utmost dedication and devotion to 
preserving the freedom of our Nation. His commitment and bravery gives 
his widow and infant daughter, Rachel and Ariana Porto, of Edgewood, 
Maryland, immense pride.

Madam Speaker, I ask that you join with me today to honor the life of 
Cpl Jonathan Daniel Porto. It gives me great pride to honor one of our 
Nation's fallen heroes.
