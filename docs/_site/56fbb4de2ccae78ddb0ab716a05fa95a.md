`Mrs. BOXER â€” 14 May 2007`

Mrs. BOXER. Before the leader leaves, I hope I can get the attention 
of the floor staff, to make sure--my understanding is you have now 
offered the amendments on Iraq to the underlying bill, but the text 
that is before us is clean of the Iraq amendments? I think it is a good 
thing to do because we can move on here with WRDA, as the amendments 
were applied to the underlying text, not to the amendment we are 
working on.

I thank my colleague for thinking it through. I am proud he is with 
us in wanting to move this WRDA bill forward.

Let a message go out we are going to move this bill forward. One of 
the reasons I say to my friend, thank you--I don't want to keep him 
here, I just want to thank him.

We have received a letter from the National Construction Alliance. It 
is the Laborers International Union of North America, the International 
Union of Operating Engineers, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters & 
Joiners of America.

The reason I am bringing this up is they are very strong supporters 
of WRDA. I think their letter lays out why, so I am actually going to 
read it so it goes into the Record at this point. It says:




 Dear Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe:



 The National Construction Alliance, representing the three 


 leading construction unions advocating for robust federal 


 infrastructure investment, endorses the Senate version of the 


 Water Resources Development Act reauthorization. This vital 


 Federal infrastructure legislation should be considered and 


 passed by the United States Senate. Our three constituent 


 unions, the Laborers, Operating Engineers and the Carpenters, 


 commend you both for your strong, bipartisan leadership on 


 this legislation.


This gets to the heart of why Senator Inhofe and I and all on the 
committee believe so strongly about the bill.




 The $13.9 billion authorization of Corps of Engineers 


 projects is an important and necessary step in addressing our 


 country's serious backlog of water projects. From harbor 


 improvement to flood protection, to lock and dam 


 construction, dredging and environmental infrastructure, your 


 bill will immeasurably strengthen America's water resources. 


 As labor unions representing nearly one million skilled 


 construction workers, we recognize that this WRDA 


 reauthorization will create tens of thousands of good paying 


 construction jobs.



 We strongly urge the Senate to pass your legislation in an 


 expeditious manner so that America's critical water 


 infrastructure needs can be addressed.


I say to the President--who is sitting in the chair today, as opposed 
to the President of the United States--he has so long been speaking 
about the problem of our loss of middle-class jobs. What is so 
important about this particular bill is that while we are doing things 
the Nation must have in order to grow and in order to protect itself 
from the ravages of Mother Nature, as we saw in Katrina--in the course 
of doing the right thing we are creating good jobs. It is a wonderful 
winner for everybody.

That is why we have more letters I want to share with colleagues. The 
American Society of Civil Engineers has added its voice to all these 
unions, to both Senator Inhofe and myself, saying they are very pleased 
with this bill, they are very pleased with the levee system fixes; they 
believe this is


overdue legislation and that it ensures we have learned the lessons 
from Hurricane Katrina. It ''goes far toward protecting human life and 
property in flood-prone areas.''

They ask us if the American Society of Civil Engineers can be of more 
assistance, please call them. We may, because we want everybody to 
weigh in here and help us.

We have a letter from the Audubon Society. You have heard from the 
business side, the union side, now the environmental side. They have a 
million members. They say, please, let's have prompt consideration of 
WRDA because it restores America's natural resources. It includes:




 . . . Corps modernization provisions, including independent 


 review of costly or controversial Corps projects and ensuring 


 that mitigation for Corps projects is consistent with 


 stricter State laws.


This refers to the Corps' formula in the last bill which is embedded 
in this bill.

Audubon also talks about:




 . . . two crucial Everglades restoration projects--Indian 


 River lagoon and Picayune Strand--that would mitigate harmful 


 federal drainage projects, restore more than 160,000 acres of 


 wetlands and significant estuarine habitat, and help secure 


 Florida's tourism and outdoor recreation economy.


They also cite the upper Mississippi River restoration program, in 
its first 15-year increment, will preserve 105,000 acres of habitat; 
protect 35,000 acres of floodplain habitat in five States along the 
river.

The Coastal Louisiana restoration program will begin to reverse the 
devastating pattern of land loss, protecting important habitat for 
birds and fish and other wildlife as well as the region's economy and 
quality of life.

The bill permanently authorizes the Asian Carp Barrier to protect the 
Great Lakes from this looming threat. The Audubon Society, which is so 
well respected on both sides of the aisle, closes and says that 
ecosystem restoration projects for the Everglades, the Mississippi, 
Louisiana's coastal wetlands, and the Great Lakes are overdue, as is 
Corps modernization.

Then I will add to these letters, Mr. President, a letter from the 
National Association of Manufacturers. I mean, this is one of those 
bills that gets everybody's support. It is something that is important 
for everyone.

They say: On behalf of more than 14 million manufacturing employees 
in the U.S., they are thanking us for our leadership, and they are 
saying: Let's move forward with WRDA. It is important. They say that: 
America's water resources infrastructure needs to be reliable and 
productive.

They applaud our efforts and they say how vitally needed WRDA is, 
including the modernization of locks, harbors, canals, and other key 
infrastructure that is vital to America's competitiveness. They say: 
WRDA will authorize many of these needs. So that is the National 
Association of Manufacturers. So it goes on and on.

The Pacific Northwest Waterways Association has a similar letter that 
is very important to us. The American Farm Bureau. The American Farm 
Bureau has entered this, and they have written us saying it is a good 
bill, urging us to support WRDA, and they oppose any amendment that 
would hinder our progress in moving forward.

The corn growers of America, they have weighed in and they say: It is 
important. They have sent a letter to Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, 
our leaders, saying we need to have this bill. They need to have 
efficient transportation networks and so on. This is a very important 
letter, I think. They say that continued development of our water 
resources in an environmentally sound manner will contribute mightily 
to our Nation's well-being.

Congress needs to act now to address issues such as environmental 
restoration, navigation, flood control, hurricane protection, water 
supply, irrigation, beach nourishment, and recreation.

So that is yet another letter. The American Public Works Association 
has sent us a letter. They have a similar message: With adequate 
dredging, our ports and waterways are the backbone of our 
transportation system, ensuring domestic and international trade 
opportunities and low-cost, environmentally sensitive goods movements. 
It goes on.

Now, I have already placed some of those letters in the Record, and I 
am going to do it again today because I think every day, as colleagues 
will look at the Record, they will see their importance.

I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record 
at the end of my remarks.
