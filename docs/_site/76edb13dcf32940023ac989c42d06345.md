`Mr. BURTON of Indiana â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, those who don't profit from 
history are destined to make the same mistakes over and over again.

When I knew this debate was going to take place, I went back and 
started having my staff go through all the newspapers they could find 
prior to World War II criticizing Winston Churchill for his stand 
against Hitler and the build-up in violation of the Treaty of 
Versailles of Nazi Germany, and nobody listened. And as a result of 
nobody listening, 62 million people died. Not 1,000, not 10,000; 62 
million people died. You ought to read these articles. They are very 
interesting. He was maligned; he was criticized. They said he should be 
run out of Parliament. And, of course, once the war started, he became 
Prime Minister and one of the greatest men of the 20th century.



We are in a world war now against terrorism. I know my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle said this isn't a world war, this is a 
civil war. But if you look at the record, since 1983, there have been 
numerous attacks, numerous attacks, on the West. There have been 
attacks at the World Trade Center in 1993. There was attacks in 1994; 
the Khobar Towers in 1996; the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 
1998; USS Cole in 2000; the September 11, 2001 attacks which brought 
this country into the war; the London bombings in 2005 and countless 
other attacks. This is not confined just to the Middle East. These 
people want to spread their venom throughout the world.

Now, if we pull out of Iraq, what does that do? Everybody knows right 
now that the President of Iran wants to expand his sphere of influence. 
He is sending terrorists across the border from Iran into Iraq. He is 
helping Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Let me read to you a quote from him. He said, ''Israel should be 
wiped off the map'' and that ''anybody who recognizes Israel,'' anybody 
who recognizes Israel, ''will burn in the fire of the Islamic nations' 
fury.'' And they have been involved in terrorist attacks. They are 
trying to build a nuclear bomb right now, and they are watching us on 
television as we speak, make no mistake.

Iran and the terrorists are watching, and they are thinking, my gosh, 
the will of the American people is waning, and we are going to turn 
tail and run. We are going to pull out.

This isn't Vietnam. Vietnam was a country, Cambodia and Laos are 
countries in southeast Asia. This is a world war. They have attacked 
the United States of America. It was a worse tragedy than that which 
took place in Hawaii in 1941 when they attacked Pearl Harbor, and now 
they are trying to develop a nuclear bomb.

If we pull out of Iraq, you may rest assured that Iran's sphere of 
influence will grow, and the fear of Iran throughout the Middle East 
and the world will grow. They will not back down from their development 
of a nuclear weapon and a delivery system that can reach not only the 
Middle East and Europe, but the entire world.

What I am trying to say now is if we start pulling out and looking 
like we are turning tail and running, we are likely to be in another 
huge war in the years to come. I don't know whether it will be 2 years, 
5 years or 10 years, or quicker than that. But if they develop a 
nuclear weapon, and they see that we are weak, and we are pulling out, 
they are going to push like they have been pushing, and they will push, 
and they will push, and they will push until we have to go into a war 
that is much greater than what we face today.

There is a lot at stake right here, right now. My colleagues, I 
think, are being very myopic. They are not looking at the big picture. 
This is something that I think all of us ought to think about.

You know, we all have kids, and we all have grandkids, and we all 
have friends who are fighting in Iraq right now. We know young men who 
have gone over there and sacrificed, lost their arms and legs and have 
died, and it is tragic, it is a horrible thing. World War II was 
horrible.

Every war was horrible. When you see people dying, in combat, you can 
hardly stand it, because you know how their families and they feel, 
those who survive.

War is hell. But sometimes it is necessary. If you don't stand up to 
a bully or a tyrant, then they will push, and they will push, and they 
will push until you have to fight. If you wait too long, the fight is 
so severe that you really get hurt. It is better to whip them at the 
beginning than to wait until later on when the cost is much, much 
higher.

Lord Chamberlain went to Munich in 1938. He signed a peace agreement 
on Herr Hitler's terms, gave the Sudetenland to him and said, Hey, if 
you don't go into Poland or Czechoslovakia, we'll let you have it. All 
we want is peace, peace in our time.

He came back, and he had given the green light to Adolf Hitler 
because he appeared weak, and the allied forces appeared weak, they 
were dismantling their weapons and their military, and he said, They're 
weak. We can do whatever we want. So he started World War II, and 62 
million people died.

We are in the same situation today, in my opinion, with the radical 
terrorists and Iran. We need to let them know that we are going to be 
firm, and we are going to stand up to whatever they throw at us right 
now so that we don't face a major Holocaust down the road. I really 
believe this. I am not just saying this as a political speech. I am not 
saying any of my colleagues are just making political speeches now, 
today. I really believe what they are saying.

But I am convinced after studying history and watching what happened 
in the past, that if we don't deal with this problem now, we will deal 
with it later, and the costs will be a heck of a lot more than it is 
today, and it may involve millions and millions of lives. Can you 
imagine what would happen if a nuclear weapon was launched in New York, 
California or someplace else in this country? Can you imagine?

Can you imagine a Holocaust if a nuclear war broke out involving Iran 
throughout the world, not only in the Middle East? This is what I think 
we face right now. Deal with them now, let them know we are going to 
stand firm, Iraq is going to be a democracy. We are not going to let 
Iran or any of the terrorists prevail, and we are going to stop a 
Holocaust in the future.
