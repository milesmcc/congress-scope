Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, efforts to cut off funding for our 
troops in harm's way is really unacceptable and would be a devastating 
message for us to send to our men and women in our Armed Forces, to 
their families, and to the families of our Nation's fallen heroes. No 
one knows this better


than Sam Johnson, our colleague from Texas, who is a true American 
hero; and I commend him for introducing House Resolution 511. I would 
commend it to every Member of this body to support.

And I want to say to the Democrats that if they should mean what they 
say and do what they mean, they really cannot have it both ways on this 
vote. To vote to support the troops in the field and then not give them 
the equipment and the supplies and the resources that they need to win 
is deceptive, it is dangerous, and it puts the lives of American 
servicemen and -women at risk.

The Democrat majority must understand the stakes in Iraq. Certainly, 
our constituents understand the stakes that are there, both in the 
terms of human life and global stability.

I would commend H.R. 511 to our colleagues for support.
