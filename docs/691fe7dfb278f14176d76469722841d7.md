Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor all 
branches of the military this Armed Forces Day. I speak for Kansas and 
for the United States when I say that the men and women who make our 
country safe have earned our respect and our appreciation.

Many are called upon to protect our towns, our businesses and our 
homes in times of crisis. When Mother Nature strikes, the National 
Guard absorbs the blow and ensures that life will go on as usual. Each 
of our military personnel has been tasked with the defense of our 
Nation. When terrorism, tyranny and injustice strike, the National 
Guard, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force, and the Coast 
Guard absorb the blow so that we can remain free. Free to enjoy our 
values, to pursue our hopes and dreams.

These service men and women have been asked to travel to Iraq or 
Afghanistan, to be away from their spouses, their children, their 
jobs--that's a lot to ask of anyone. Yet they go and they fulfill their 
responsibilities to their State and our country. Today we recognize 
these brave men and women. Every day we recognize those who serve. I 
want to thank them for their vital role in making this Nation the land 
of the brave and the home of the free.
