Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2956. We 
must support and protect our troops, and the best way to do that is to 
bring them home.

The American people want the troops out of harm's way. The White 
House has not met its own benchmarks, and with this resolution, the 
Iraqi leaders, for once, will know that we mean business.

Mr. Speaker, the pain and suffering felt because of this war is 
unconscionable. New York has lost over a 150 brave young souls; yet, 
for this President, there's no ending to this war.

There is a smarter way. Under H.R. 2956, our troops start to come 
home in 120 days. Over 70 percent of Americans want us out of Iraq. 
Democracy is about elected officials listening to the people. Democracy 
is what we are trying to teach Iraqis, how to run their own democracy. 
By voting to bring our troops home, we can show them.

The American people want this war to be over. Put your faith and 
trust in them. Choose democracy. Choose a way forward. Vote for this 
resolution.
