Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. PFC Shane R. Austin was killed on October 8, 
2006, when a grenade struck his tank in Ramadi, Iraq, west of Baghdad. 
He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 35th Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade 
Combat Team, 1st Armored Division in Baumholder, Germany.


Private Austin's grandmother said, ''Although the emptiness and 
numbness is with the entire family, we hold the pride high that Shane 
was a hero before he left for the military, but now he is everybody's 
hero. Military was his dream; he intended to make it a career and that 
he accomplished . . . it was just a short career.''

Private Austin served his country with distinction and courage.

Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative Dennis Moore for 
introducing this legislation and urge the swift passage of this bill.
