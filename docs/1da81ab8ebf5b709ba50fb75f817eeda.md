Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, over the last week, we have seen more proof 
of the devastating effects that war in Iraq is having on our Nation's 
budget and military.

Last week CRS reported that the average monthly cost of the Iraq War 
is now $10 billion a month. That means this year alone, the Bush 
administration has already spent $60 billion in Iraq. Just imagine how 
we could have used $60 billion here at home? We could have improved a 
lot of Americans' lives and addressed our deficit.

The war is also negatively impacting our military. Last week the Army 
announced it missed its recruiting goals for the 2nd month in a row, 
falling 1,000 recruits shy of its June goals.

Mr. Speaker, the status quo cannot continue in Iraq. That's why 
Democrats have repeatedly tried to change the direction of the war, 
with little help from our friends across the aisle. How much worse do 
things have to get before congressional Republicans stop blindly 
following President Bush?

The warning signs of change have been in the air for months. But 
Republicans refuse to see them.
