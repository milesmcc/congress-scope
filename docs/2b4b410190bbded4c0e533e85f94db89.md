# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `2b4b410190bbded4c0e533e85f94db89`
`Mr. ACKERMAN â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. ACKERMAN. They can likewise vote against the annual and 
supplemental appropriations that fund the war.

What Members ought not be able to do is to waste 3 full hours of the 
House's time debating a resolution founded, at best, on a mistake and, 
at worst, a willful intention to pretend that recent history that we 
did authorize this war by a 420-1 vote can be dropped into the ''memory 
hole.''

No matter what Members believe about the war in Afghanistan, this 
resolution deserves to fail.
