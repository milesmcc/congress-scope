Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor of this House 
today wearing my American Legion auxiliary pin, as I do every day, to 
honor the men and women of our Armed Forces who have served and 
continue to give the highest service to this country even today in 
Afghanistan, Iraq and around the world.

And I rise as a proud American and the representative of the more 
than 120,000 people of the United States Virgin Islands who love this 
country and desire nothing more than it be the strongest and best it 
can be in support of House Concurrent Resolution 63, which expresses 
our strong support for the members of the U.S. Armed Forces for their 
honorable and brave service in Iraq, but just as forcefully and clearly 
states our disapproval of the decision of the President to deploy the 
over 20,000 additional troops.



I don't take this position lightly, as we currently have over 100 
members of the Virgin Islands National Guard serving in that theater 
today, and having recently lost two members of the Guard as well as 
four other soldiers who preceded them.

However, Madam Speaker, as the sole Representative of the people of 
the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Congress, Americans who have fought and 
died in every war and conflict from the Revolutionary War to this and 
yet cannot vote for the Commander in Chief, I consider it my solemn 
duty to express their views on this, the most pressing and important 
issue facing our country.

Madam Speaker, our fellow Americans spoke loud and clear last 
November, expressing a desire for a change of direction in Iraq, and by 
a more than 2-to-1 margin, they presently oppose the President's plan.

It is important, Madam Speaker, that we engage in this important 
debate today. The American people are demanding that we do so. Far from 
second-guessing the President's strategy and undermining our troops, as 
the White House charges, we are fulfilling our constitutional role and 
doing the responsible thing. The last 4 years have demonstrated that 
the present course in Iraq is not the correct one, and it is time that 
we demand that the President listen to other experienced experts and 
responsible voices that are calling for another approach.

This modest resolution is but the first step in that effort, an 
effort to support our troops and support our Nation by holding the 
President and the Department of Defense accountable, by insisting on an 
exit strategy that extricates our men and women from what is now a 
civil war, and allows the Iraqi people and their government to take 
responsibility for their country's welfare.

We are also told by Members on the other side of the aisle, Madam 
Speaker, that if we change course in Iraq, it will be disastrous for 
the Iraqi people. But the Iraqis themselves don't think so. Not only do 
polls show that 78 percent of Iraqis believe that American troops


provoked more violence than they prevented and that nearly three-
quarters of Baghdad residents would feel safer if American forces left 
Iraq, but previous surges have indeed resulted in an escalation of 
violence, killing greater numbers of Americans as well as Iraqis.

Instead of beating the drums of war, the President should be engaging 
in diplomacy, as the Iraqi Study Group called for, to pursue our common 
interest in a stable Iraq, even if it means sitting down with Syria and 
Iran, as we have done in the past. Peace and the lives of our men and 
women deserve this effort.

With all of the thousands of Iraqis killed and over 3,100 of our 
troops having made the ultimate sacrifice, we have paid a far greater 
price for the decision to invade Iraq without the proper justification 
or an exit strategy and without adequate preparation, training, and 
protection for our troops. We have further paid the price of the loss 
of respect and esteem by the international community and the loss by 
the people of this country of any confidence that what we are told by 
the White House is the truth.

While we, sadly, cannot bring back those who have died, we can honor 
their memory by restoring truth and restoring this country to the high 
respect, regard, and leadership that the brave men and women of our 
Armed Forces dedicate and sacrifice their lives to preserve.

House Concurrent Resolution 63 begins that restoration and repair. I 
urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution.
