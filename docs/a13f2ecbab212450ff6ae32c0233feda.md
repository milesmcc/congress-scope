Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday morning the 
National Intelligence Estimate report was released outlining threats to 
the United States over the next several years. I am grateful that since 
September the 11th counterterrorism efforts have stopped terrorists 
from additional attacks on American soil.

The report confirms that the threat to America is real, and al Qaeda 
has intensified efforts to attack the United States. I appreciate the 
brave men and women worldwide in the fight in the global war on 
terrorism so that we do not face another attack here at home. They are 
fighting to protect American families, and their presence in Iraq and 
Afghanistan is vital to this effort which al Qaeda has identified as 
the central front.

The report reiterates the threat to the United States and the 
significance of our mission in Iraq. We must remain on the offense 
everywhere and remember that the threat to our Nation is real. Al Qaeda 
is like a cancer which must be stopped at all sources or it will 
spread.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
