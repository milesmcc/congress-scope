`Mr. BURRIS â€” 10 November 2009`

Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, 234 years ago today, a group of American 
patriots gathered to found a new branch of the Armed Forces.

They organized and trained a robust fighting force that has 
distinguished itself time and again in the years since that day.

In 1805, these brave warriors were ordered into battle by President 
Jefferson. They fought for safe passage of American ships and American 
citizens, defending our fledgling nation against a grave new threat.

In fact, they carried this fight halfway around the world to the city 
of Derne, on the shores of Tripoli.

And 40 years later, at the height of the Mexican-American War, this 
fighting force again proved their bravery.

They charged enemy positions at Chapultepec Castle, eventually 
capturing the enemy capital, and leading U.S. forces into the very 
halls of Montezuma.

In these defining moments, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores 
of Tripoli, the legend of the United States Marine Corps was born.



Since the early days of our Republic, the Marines have been at the 
forefront of America's defenses.

And in every subsequent conflict from the days of the Revolution to 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan these brave warriors have proven their 
mettle, and put their lives on the line to defend our freedom.

For their sacrifice, their bravery, and their heroism, they deserve 
the praise and thanks of a grateful nation.

So, to every man and woman who has worn the uniform of the U.S. 
Marines: we thank you. And we owe you our very best.

As a member of the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees, I 
am inspired by stories of those who serve almost on a daily basis.

And I will work with my colleagues to make sure this country keeps 
its commitment to these fine individuals.

So this Veterans Day, as the Marines celebrate 234 years of 
distinguished service and brave sacrifice, let us all offer our utmost 
gratitude and support to all of those in uniform.
