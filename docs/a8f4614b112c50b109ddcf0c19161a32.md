Ms. LANDRIEU. We have hurricane levees in this bill. We also have 
housing vouchers. The risks have increased substantially in the region. 
After the storm, we lost 250,000 dwellings in Louisiana and thousands 
in Mississippi. We have a homeless population that has doubled. There 
are housing vouchers in the bill for the homeless, for the very low 
income, and for the disabled. After storms like these, that population 
is gravely threatened.

I will come back later and finish my remarks. This is important to 
the people of the gulf coast. I thank the Senator for the time allowed 
this morning. I urge my colleagues, in supporting the war funding in 
Iraq, please let's remember the emergency still going on at home.
