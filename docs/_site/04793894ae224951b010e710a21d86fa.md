Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, next month we will be celebrating the 75th 
anniversary of Social Security. Before 1935, half of America's seniors 
lived in poverty. Since FDR signed Social Security into law, we have 
upheld a sacred trust to our parents and grandparents that after 
decades of hard work, raising their children, and defending the U.S. 
against foreign enemies, that they would be able to retire with dignity 
and respect.

Three weeks ago, my colleague from Ohio, the House Republican leader, 
implied that we should raise the retirement age to 70 for everyone, 
office workers and construction workers alike, and cut Social Security 
benefits to help reduce the deficit and pay for the war in Afghanistan. 
Raiding Social Security in this way is both irresponsible, and it is a 
breach of trust.

We should not be gutting Social Security and breaching our sacred 
trust to America's seniors. It's amazing that Republicans are willing 
to gut Social Security and refuse unemployment compensation during 
these challenging times while at the same time arguing that we must 
preserve the tax cuts for the superwealthy.
