Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, General Petraeus presented 
Congress with the progress report that we requested. Rather than 
encountering a fair dialogue on the situation in Iraq,


he was confronted with an accusation of treason by one of the Nation's 
most prominent and well-funded liberal advocacy organizations.

Last week the Senate took the appropriate course of action to 
officially, and in a bipartisan fashion, condemn this atrocious act on 
a distinguished war hero. I call on the Democrat leadership to follow 
the Senate's lead and allow for consideration of House Resolution 644.

The men and women of our Armed Forces have committed themselves to 
the defense of this Nation. I ask my colleagues, who will come to their 
defense when their integrity and patriotism come under attack?
