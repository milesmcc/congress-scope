Mr. FARR. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Chair, I rise in support of this budget. I didn't do it without 
some reservation, because I've been spending a lot of time listening to 
the needs of this country as it juxtaposes itself in the world, in 
Afghanistan and in Iraq, certainly in South America where I served as a 
Peace Corps volunteer. And what I think is very dangerous about the 
thinking of cutting the foreign aid, the 150 account, is that is all 
the humanitarian aid. If the combatant commanders tell us that you 
cannot win this war on military terms, that you're going to have to use 
civilian power, that's what we call soft power, smart power, then 
that's the account that invests in it, the account that invests in 
foreign aid and extended IMET programs to bring foreign officers to 
train in the United States, to send Peace Corps volunteers around the 
world. And I'm a strong supporter of what has been promised to be 
working that out. And I think that it's a bold budget for


a great new President of the United States, and I look forward to 
supporting it.
