# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Mr. BUYER. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, this past fall I had an 
opportunity to meet with 18 representatives of the European Union. The 
European Union is quick to say that we are not necessarily with you on 
Iraq. But boy, we are with you in Syria and standing tough on Iran.

Do you know what the message is? It is inextricable. You cannot pick 
and choose. The Middle East is so complex. So, Mr. Speaker, when you 
begged of me to address you the question, it is this: If we were to 
follow the Pelosi-Murtha plan, what happens to Israel if we leave a 
vacuum that is quickly filled by Islamic extremists in Iraq? Therein 
lies the question.

I believe we jeopardize the safety and security of a lone democracy 
called Israel, and we leave them to defend against a region filled with 
vipers who seek their annihilation.

Now, our friends who are also of Arab nations, they are partners in 
our coalition to help on the political and economic success of Iraq, 
and they are eager for us to also help Israel and the Palestinians 
resolve those differences. It is all inextricable.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
