`Mr. UDALL of New Mexico â€” 19 December 2007`

Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, the men and women who put on 
the uniform of the National Guard have acted with extreme bravery and 
integrity. Through the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, these soldiers 
have fought valiantly, without question and without reservations, and 
they embody the entire spirit of service.

In New Mexico, the National Guard has played an historic role in 
defending our Nation. Members of the New Mexico National Guard served 
as ''Rough Riders'' on San Juan Hill


with Teddy Roosevelt, served as prisoners of war at Bataan for 
horrendous years during World War II, and were deployed to Operation 
Desert Shield. Whether fighting during a time of war, assisting local 
and State law enforcement, or guarding our borders, New Mexico's 
National Guard stands ''ready to fight'' and accomplishes every mission 
it receives with distinction and with pride.

We in the House offer our unconditional support of these men and 
women, and I strongly support this legislation.
