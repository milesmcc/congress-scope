`Mr. JORDAN of Ohio â€” 13 February 2009`

---


Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Staff Sergeant Jason Burkholder, an American hero and a native son of 
Ohio's Fourth Congressional District who at the age of 27 made the 
ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation on February 8, 2009, in 
Afghanistan.

Jason graduated from Elida High School in 2000 and joined the United 
States Marine Corps where he served for 4 years. In December 2004 he 
enlisted in the Ohio Army National Guard, with whom he served as part 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He later joined the Illinois National Guard 
in 2008.

Jason was an athlete, a leader, a trusted colleague and a loyal 
friend. He brought energy and excitement to the lives of others. He was 
a good son and a loving husband. It was a great privilege to speak with 
Jason's wife, Amanda, as well as his parents, Bruce and Diane. I pray 
that they will know the fullness of God's peace.

I was moved by the outpouring of affection for Jason from his friends 
in Allen County, Ohio and beyond. He had a dramatic impact on the lives 
of many people.

A marine and a soldier, he fought to promote freedom. He gave his 
life in defense of his family, community, State and Nation. He made our 
world safer. He made his family and every American proud. For this, 
each and every American owes him and his family a great debt of 
gratitude.

Jason will be deeply missed, but the strength of his character and 
the courage he demonstrated through his service will live on.
