Mr. MURPHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today with the solemn 
duty to report the tragic passing of Marine Cpl Nicholas Uzenski. 
Corporal Uzenski was taken from us on January 11, 2010, in an ambush by 
insurgents in Southern Afghanistan.

Corporal Uzenski was a member of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, 
Bravo Company, based in Okinawa, Japan. A beloved son, grandson, 
brother, friend, and soldier, Corporal Uzenski will be sorely missed by 
the entire Franklin community, and a grateful nation whose freedom he 
fought to protect.

Just 21 years old, Corporal Uzenski followed in the footsteps of his 
father and uncle in joining the Marines. It was his lifelong dream to 
serve the nation he loved and defend the ideals for which he gave the 
ultimate sacrifice.

Corporal Uzenski is survived by his mother Lisa, his father William, 
stepmother Rebakah, and six siblings. Our thoughts and prayers are with 
the entire Uzenski family during this difficult time.

As we stand on this floor and debate the important issues of our 
time, let us never forget the true cost of the freedoms that we so 
often take for granted.
