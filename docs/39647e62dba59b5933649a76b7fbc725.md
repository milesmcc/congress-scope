Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Master Sergeant Sean Michael 
Thomas died on March 27, 2007 in Baghdad, Iraq. He was serving with the 
Harrisburg-based 28th Division Support Command. Master Sergeant Thomas 
joined the Pennsylvania National Guard in 1998 after 6 years in the 
Army Reserve. He had planned to attend Officer Candidates School in 
October and wanted to be a teacher when he returned to civilian life. 
His unit's commander, Colonel Jesse Deets, called Master Sergeant 
Thomas a model officer and friend.

Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative Christopher Carney 
for introducing this legislation and urge the swift passage of this 
bill.

The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read 
the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the 
table.
