Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly support H.R. 2929, a bill to prohibit 
permanent bases in Iraq, and I thank the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. Lee) and the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen) for their persistent 
leadership on this important issue.

The House passed the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq this month to 
get our troops out of Iraq by April. The question now is not whether we 
will redeploy our troops, but when and how.

This resolution makes it emphatically clear to the Iraqi people and 
to President Bush that we do not intend to keep troops in Iraq 
indefinitely.



The United States must not be seen as an occupier. Otherwise, our 
presence there will be used to recruit insurgents, to keep Iraq 
entrenched in violence and to create an even more dangerous environment 
for our troops.

This House, too, has already expressed its opposition to permanent 
bases, but today, we do it clearly with bipartisan support and send a 
very clear statement. I urge all of our colleagues to listen to the 
will of the American people, of the Iraqi people, and to support H.R. 
2929.
