Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask my colleague for 30 
seconds. I listened carefully to the Senator's thoughts on the Iraqi 
funding issue. I commend the Senator for that. We have amendments that 
address it. In the managers' package are certain amendments that the 
Senator from Maine put in. That is a very important issue. We owe no 
less responsibility to the American taxpayers but to assure that every 
single dollar going into that area at this time is absolutely essential 
for the purpose of the mission of our troops and otherwise, and that 
the Iraqi Government be made aware that they are a sovereign government 
now and such expenses as can be should be borne by that Government.
