`Mr. FEINGOLD â€” 26 January 2007`

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted for LTG David H. Petraeus of the 
U.S. Army to be general and commander, Multi-National Forces--Iraq. He 
is a highly experienced individual with a long history of excellent and 
selfless service to this country. I believe he represents the high 
caliber and professionalism of our Nation's military, and I wish him 
well with an extremely difficult assignment.

But while I am supporting his nomination, I in no way support the 
President's policies in Iraq. The President has made the wrong judgment 
about Iraq time and again, first by taking us into war on a fraudulent 
basis, then by keeping our brave troops in Iraq, and now by pushing to 
put 21,500 more American troops into harm's way.

The indefinite presence of U.S. military personnel in Iraq will not 
fix that country's political problems. And as we have seen over the 
last few years, sending more troops will not provide the stability in 
Iraq that can only come from a political agreement. Congress must 
develop the courage to confront this President on what has become one 
of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in our history.
