Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I rise today on the eve of Veterans Day 
to honor all those who have and are now serving to protect our 
freedoms, especially the service men and women of my State who have 
such a vital role in our Nation's defense.

At trouble spots across the world--from Afghanistan to Korea, Iraq to 
Kosovo--Alaskan servicemembers are on the front lines.

Today, I welcome the opportunity to praise Alaska's service men and 
women, their families who are such a key part of our communities, and 
the thousands of veterans who have chosen to live in the 49th State.



Nearly 75 years ago, Air Force GEN Billy Mitchell testified before 
Congress and famously said:




 Alaska is the most strategic place in the world.


General Mitchell's pronouncement might have been an eye-opener for 
Members of Congress in 1935, but the importance of Alaska's strategic 
location has been well known to Alaskans for centuries.

Shortly after Alaska's purchase from Russia in 1867, the U.S. Army 
was dispatched to help administer the new American territory. Within 10 
years, a significant presence was established in Alaska by both the 
Navy and the Reserve Service, which later became the U.S. Coast Guard.

The Army helped maintain law and order during the turn of the century 
Gold Rush, which saw thousands scramble north in search of fame and 
fortune.

With the buildup to World War II, Alaska's vital role in the Nation's 
defense grew dramatically. Alaska's Aleutian Islands were the only 
American territory occupied by the Japanese during the war. Dislodging 
them in brutal conditions cost American and Japanese troops more than 
6,000 casualties combined.

Servicing Alaska's strategic military needs during the war required 
construction of the 1,400-mile Alaskan-Canadian Highway, known as the 
ALCAN. This road was built largely by three African-American regiments, 
and their success helped spur the Army to end segregation among its 
ranks.

Some of the Nation's most essential eyes and ears during the war were 
soldiers of the Alaska Territorial Guard. These Eskimo volunteers, 
capable of living off the land as they guarded against invasion, knew 
every nook and cranny of Alaska's coastline. Today, some two dozen of 
these scouts are still with us--most in their eighties and still living 
largely off the land through subsistence hunting and fishing.

As a member of the Armed Services Committee and working with my 
colleague, Senator Murkowski, we guaranteed in next year's military 
budget bill that these brave guardsmen will receive proper Federal 
benefits and recognition for their service.

Today Alaska is home to some 30,000 Active-Duty service men and 
women. Another 30,000 Alaskans are the family members of these soldiers 
and airmen.

Alaska's major military installations include Elmendorf, Eielson, and 
Clear Air Force Bases, Army Forts Richardson, Wainwright, and Greely, 
and Kulis Air National Guard Base. Through these bases, about one in 
five Alaskans has a personal tie to the military.

To maintain these vital posts, the Department of Defense spends in 
excess of $1.5 billion a year in our State. That is a huge part of 
Federal spending in Alaska, which constitutes about 18 percent of the 
State economy.

Alaska is also proud to have the highest per capita population of 
veterans of any State. The more than 75,000 veterans who call our State 
home comprise 11 percent of our population.

Alaska's bases support the latest and greatest in the military's 
arsenal: from the F-22, the Air Force's latest fifth generation fighter 
aircraft; the C-17 cargo aircraft; the Army's Stryker vehicle; and the 
Ground-Based Midcourse element of missile defense.

Today more than 4,000 servicemembers stationed in Alaska are 
supporting overseas contingency operations around the world.

Just last month, we welcomed home the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team 
of the 25th Infantry Division based at Fort Wainwright. This brigade 
spent 12 months in Iraq's Diyala Province doing a remarkable job 
protecting the people of Iraq.

Still in Iraq is the 545th Military Police Company of the Arctic 
Military Police Battalion that continues to patrol the streets of Baji.

The Alaska National Guard also has a vital role in that theater. The 
Guard's 207th Aviation Regiment continues to fly C-23 Sherpa military 
aircraft missions, delivering more than 1 million pounds of cargo 
throughout Iraq.

Back home, the Guard plays a significant role in the defense of our 
Nation around the clock. At Fort Greely, they staff the operations 
center for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, protecting the 
United States from ballistic missile threats from countries such as 
North Korea and Iran.

The Guard also provides invaluable search and rescue support and 
other vital missions to ensure the safety of our citizens in our vast 
State.

Alaskans continue to serve in harm's way in Afghanistan and Iraq. The 
4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division operates 
in Afghanistan's Regional Command-East in support of the International 
Security Assistance Force.

These soldiers are bravely serving on the front lines, hunting down 
al-Qaida terrorists, securing the border, and trying to establish 
governance in this vital part of the world.

Since their arrival in February, the 4-25 BCT has suffered 
significant casualties. In fact, since the 9/11 attacks on America, 143 
servicemembers from Alaskan units deployed in support of the global war 
on terror have paid the ultimate sacrifice.

Madam President, I would like to honor those based in Alaska who were 
killed in action since September 11, 2001.

The pictures beside me which I show in the Chamber are of those who 
have fallen in the past year, just since Veterans Day 2008.

Just 2 weeks ago, a lifelong Alaskan paid the ultimate sacrifice. On 
October 23, in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, two U.S. aircraft 
collided in midair in the predawn dark. Marine Corps Cpl Gregory Fleury 
was the crew chief aboard one of those aircraft.

Corporal Fleury was just 23 years old, a graduate of Anchorage's 
Service High School. He had already served two tours of duty in Iraq as 
a combat helicopter mechanic and gunner.

The helicopter crash that took the young corporal's life was a bad 
one. But the Marines were able to recover one item that belonged to 
him--an Alaskan flag.

I spoke to Corporal Fleury's grandfather last week to thank him for 
his grandson's service on behalf of this proud Nation.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of all the 
Alaskan troops who have made the ultimate sacrifice since September 11, 
2001, be printed in the Record.
