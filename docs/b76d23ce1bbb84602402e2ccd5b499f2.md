Mr. DURBIN. Our feeling is that we could not do it immediately. The 
Baker-Hamilton study group suggested that we would basically redeploy 
our troops over a 15-month basis. That would suggest an orderly 
movement of troops of maybe 10,000 a month. But if you did it 
precipitously, it would create a danger for our troops and an 
instability. I think if we had an orderly redeployment, withdrawal, the 
Iraqis would get the message that they have to step in as American 
troops are redeployed.
