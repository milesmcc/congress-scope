Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman.

First of all, let me respond to some of the assertions made by our 
friend from Illinois. He tries to portray this as a choice, a budget 
document that represents a choice between the Iraqi people and the 
American people. I beg to differ with the gentleman.

This budget document is not a choice about that. This budget document 
represents a choice about the future of where we're going in this 
country. This represents a choice about whether we here in Washington 
are actually going to do something for the American people.

You know, if you think about the American people right now when 
they're watching us on TV, you know, I don't blame them when they look 
at the TV in disgust and say, you know, they just don't get it up in 
Washington.



They believe, and they're right, that Washington is broken and we 
have got to do something to fix it. Frankly, we have got to get the 
Federal Government working for the people again. But that means we have 
got to spend less.

The gentleman from Wisconsin talked about the fact that there is 
absolutely no treatment, no curtailment of anything having to do with 
the earmark question. Earmarks are just the tip of the iceberg as far 
as our spending culture is here in Washington. Let's go ahead and take 
the first step. Let's reform that process because we have got to spend 
less.

Let's face it: gas prices, they're too high. The American public is 
sick and tired of excuses coming out of Washington. But the way to fix 
it is not to put more burden on the American family while they are 
already facing the prospects of $4-a-gallon gas this summer. That's 
just not what we do. People across this country are worried about their 
health care. They're worried about their jobs. This stuff about we're 
going to provide you with middle-class tax cuts, have you looked to see 
what's in this document? This document will lead us to the largest tax 
increase in American history.

The choice here is not between whether we are going to provide for 
our national security and the people of America. The choice here is 
whether we are going to trust in the people to control their own 
destiny.
