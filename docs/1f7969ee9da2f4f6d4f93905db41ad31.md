`Mr. BUNNING â€” 8 February 2007`

---


Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, to say that I find this disappointing is 
quite an understatement.

I ask the majority leader to allow us to have a full and fair debate 
on the CR and allow us to offer amendments. We should be able to debate 
and vote on the Gregg resolution. This is a resolution that does not 
play into our enemies' hands. General Petraeus commented that a 
commander needs to show the enemy that there is no hope of victory. The 
Gregg resolution does this. It expresses our absolute support for our 
Commander in Chief and our men and women in Iraq, instead of showing 
that the will of the American people has been stripped by opportunistic 
terrorists.

Mr. President, for Republicans, this is not about a Senate procedural 
process but about the priorities of the American people. Our Republican 
leader, my colleague from Kentucky, has tried all week to negotiate to 
get a vote on the Gregg resolution, in conjunction with the other 
resolution, the Warner resolution. I appreciate Senator McConnell's 
efforts, but the majority leader, and many on both sides of the aisle, 
do not want the vote on the Gregg resolution. Instead, they claim that 
Republicans do not want to debate the war in Iraq. This is completely 
false. The American people need to know that, and the media needs to 
report the truth.

No one Republican, not one to whom I have spoken, is running from 
this debate. We want to debate the war in Iraq. Many of us oppose the 
Warner resolution. It is nonbinding. It sends the wrong message to our 
enemies and our allies. It will not end the war in Iraq, and it will 
not bring peace to the Middle East. But we should vote on it, and we 
should vote on the Gregg resolution because even though the Gregg 
resolution is nonbinding, it actually relates to the proper role of the 
Congress with respect to war.

Essentially, the Gregg resolution says that Congress will not vote to 
defund the war when we have troops in harm's way. This is the proper 
role of Congress. It does not deter from the Commander in Chief. We 
don't dictate military strategy, but we do have the power of the purse. 
We can either fund the war or not fund the war. I am not a lawyer, 
thank God, but I have spent over two decades in Congress, in both the 
House and the Senate. And I know the proper role of the legislative 
branch. I know the rules of the House, and I know the rules of the 
Senate. I also know the importance of not sending the wrong message to 
our troops in the field.

Mr. President, I have voted to send my own son into war. That was the 
gulf war. I know the stakes are very high. I know this is an issue that 
is on every American's mind. But I resent my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle saying that Republicans are running from this debate. 
We are not. I hope today that we can remind my colleagues that this is 
the U.S. Senate, and the minority has its say. We should vote both on 
the Warner resolution and the Gregg resolution and we should also vote 
to have amendments to the CR and be able to address the BRAC problem 
that we face and what will happen if they reduce this by $3.2 billion.

I have an editorial of the New York Times I will submit for the 
Record at this time. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the 
Record, and I yield to my good friend from Texas.
