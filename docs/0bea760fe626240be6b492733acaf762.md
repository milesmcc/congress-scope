Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend from Washington that we 
have a record of supporting the troops. We did it in Kosovo, we did it 
through the entire Balkans, and we did it in Afghanistan. We did it in 
Afghanistan with very few questions asked, and rightfully so. We have 
supported every effort made by this President to defeat the war on 
terror, with rare exception. But the troops in the field? Never, never 
have we wavered from that.

In fact, I don't know of a speech, although there could be some 
given, where a Democrat has talked about the war in Iraq and hasn't 
talked about how much we appreciate the work done by these valiant 
troops and the sacrifices of their families. That is why we were 
stunned during the State of the Union Address when the President even 
mentioned the veterans.

I am happy to have answered the question from the Senator from 
Washington.
