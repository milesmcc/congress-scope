`Mr. SPECTER â€” 24 September 2008`

---


Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to insert 
into the Record an article by Michael Smerconish, Esquire, concerning 
efforts by the United States to capture Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-
Zawahiri. Mr. Smerconish is a distinguished columnist who writes for 
the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News, has a 
morning talk show on the ''Big Talker,'' 1210 WPHT-AM, and appears on 
MSNBC. I have known Mr. Smerconish for more than 20 years and have a 
very high regard for his scholarship, among his other fine qualities. 
While I do not agree with all his comments, especially all his 
political evaluations, I believe this article should be made available 
to my colleagues and the public generally to the extent that the 
Congressional Record is read. Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent to 
have the article to which I refer printed in the Record.
















Pakisourced










(Michael Smerconish, Sept. 11, 2008)




 Where the hell are Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri? 


 And why does virtually no one ask anymore? What's changed 


 since the days when any suburban soccer mom would have 


 strangled either of them with her bare hands if given the 


 chance? And what happened to President Bush's declaration to 


 a joint session of Congress nine days after 9/11 that ''[A]ny 


 nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be 


 regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.'' Doesn't 


 that apply to Pakistan?



 These are things that I wonder as I watch from my perch in 


 Philadelphia, where I'm a talk show host, columnist and MSNBC 


 talking head. I have also spoken and written about them 


 incessantly, so much so that I've exhausted my welcome with 


 many conservative members of my own talk radio audience. My 


 editors at The Philadelphia Daily News and The Philadelphia 


 Inquirer have made it clear that I've published my last 


 column on this issue because I have written seven to date. On 


 the day after the Pennsylvania primary, I told Chris Matthews 


 on Hardball that this was an issue that could help Barack 


 Obama win support among white male voters, he recognized that 


 it was ''[my] issue,'' before adding, ''And I agree with you 


 completely.''



 I can't help myself. So strong is my belief that we've 


 failed in our responsibility to 3,000 dead Americans that I 


 am contemplating voting for a Democratic presidential 


 candidate for the first time in my life. It's the chronology 


 I find so compelling.



 We're at the seven year anniversary of 9/11, lacking not 


 only closure with regard to the two top al Qaeda leaders but 


 also public discourse about any plan to bring them to 


 justice. To me, that suggests a continuation of what I 


 perceive to be the Bush Administration's outsourcing of this 


 responsibility at great cost to a government with limited 


 motivation to get the job done. Of course, I may be wrong; I 


 have no inside information. And I'd love to be proven in 


 error by breaking news of their capture or execution. But 


 published accounts paint an intriguing and frustrating 


 picture.



 To begin, bin Laden is presumed to have been in Afghanistan 


 on 9/11 and to have fled that nation during the battle at 


 Tora Bora in December of 2001. Gary Berntsen, who was the CIA 


 officer in charge on the ground, told me that his request for 


 Army Rangers to prevent bin Laden's escape into Pakistan was




 denied, and sure enough, that's where bin Laden went. Then 


 came a period when the Bush Administration was supposed to be 


 pressing the search through means it couldn't share publicly. 


 But as time went by with no capture, the signs became more 


 troubling.



 We now know that in late 2005, the CIA disbanded Alec 


 Station, the FBI-CIA unit dedicated to finding bin Laden, 


 something which was reported on July 4, 2006 by The New York 


 Times. At the time, I hoped we'd closed the bin Laden unit 


 because Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was fully 


 engaged in the hunt in his country's northwest territories, 


 where the duo were supposedly hiding. In September 2006, 


 however, Musharraf reached an accord with tribal leaders 


 there, notorious for their refusal to hand over a guest. In 


 doing so, he agreed to give them continued free reign.



 The following month, in October of 2006, I participated in 


 a week-long, Pentagon-sponsored, military immersion program 


 called the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference. This was a 


 unique opportunity for 45 civilians who were invited to play 


 military tourist and learn first-hand about the United States 


 Central Command (CENTCOM). We traveled 15,000 miles and spent 


 time in four nations. Our days began at 5 or 6 a.m. and 


 didn't end until 10 or 11 p.m. Along the way, we boarded the 


 USS Iwo Jima by helicopter in the Persian Gulf, fired the 


 best of the Army's weaponry in the Kuwait desert (just 10 


 miles from Iraq), drove an 11-kilometer Humvee obstacle 


 course (designed to teach about IEDs), boarded the Air 


 Force's most sophisticated surveillance aircraft in Qatar, 


 and even took a tour of a military humanitarian outpost in 


 the Horn of Africa. In addition to Secretary Rumsfeld, we 


 were briefed by the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 


 Staff, the vice admiral of CENTCOM and other high-ranking war 


 commanders.



 I came home with the utmost respect for the men and women 


 throughout the ranks of all five branches of the service 


 committed to eradicating the forces of radical Islam. But 


 there was one thing noticeably absent: The search for bin 


 Laden and al-Zawahiri. It was not part of our otherwise 


 comprehensive agenda, and when I did ask specific questions, 


 there was no information forthcoming except a generic 


 assertion that, indeed, the hunt continued.



 When we were briefed at Andrews Air Force Base by Vice 


 Admiral David Nichols, the No. 2 to Army Gen. John Abizaid, I 


 asked him whether the hunt for bin Laden was, at that stage, 


 completely dependent upon Pakistani President Pervez 


 Musharraf. He told me we respect national sovereignty, and 


 described the search as ''difficult and nuanced.'' I took 


 that as a confirmation of my concern about outsourcing.



 When in Bahrain, I put the same question to Marine Brig. 


 Gen. Anthony Jackson. He told me that the search was the 


 equivalent of finding one man in the Rockies, an analogy that 


 I heard repeatedly from men I met overseas. He also said that 


 ''no one is giving up,'' and that my question was better put 


 to the guys in special ops.



 So, when we got to the special ops headquarters in Qatar, I 


 raised the matter yet again, this time with Col. Patrick 


 Pihana, the chief of staff to the Combined Forces Special 


 Operations Component Command. He offered nothing substantive 


 on the issue.



 No one told me the search was over, but I came home worried 


 that the days of aggressively hunting bin Laden and al-


 Zawahiri had ended. Of course, I could fully appreciate that 


 an aggressive pursuit was underway but that I, a blowhard 


 from Philadelphia, was simply deemed unworthy of any 


 information. That would have been fine.



 But there was another consideration. More than one 


 individual with whom I spoke--and no one that I have named 


 here--raised with me the question of what would happen to 


 public support for the war against radical Islam if we were 


 to find and kill bin Laden and al-Zawahiri. They wanted to 


 know: Would the American people then expect the military to 


 pack up and go home? No one ever told me that we're not 


 hunting bin Laden because killing him would cause Americans 


 to want to close up shop in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it was 


 absolutely on the minds of our warriors as support for the 


 war in Iraq dissipated.



 A few months before my return, there was news of our 


 response to the accord reached between Musharraf and the 


 tribal warlords. The agreement, which was effected on 


 September 5, 2006, stipulated that the Pakistani army would 


 pull back from the tribal areas. A report from the BBC 


 detailed what the tribal leaders would grant the army for 


 withdrawing: ''Local Taleban supporters, in turn, have 


 pledged not to harbor foreign militants, launch cross-border 


 raids or attack Pakistani government troops or facilities.''



 Meanwhile, there was no demand for accountability by our 


 government. The White House and the Pentagon consistently 


 played down the significance of capturing bin Laden and al-


 Zawahiri, and President Bush offered only superficial 


 responses to the few questions raised on the status of the 


 search. On February 23, 2007, the Army's highest-ranking 


 officer, Gen. Peter Schoomaker, said he didn't know whether 


 we would find bin Laden, and ''I don't know that it's all 


 that important, frankly.''



 At a May 24, 2007 White House news conference, when asked 


 why Osama was still at large, President Bush offered his 


 usual refrain: ''Because we haven't got him yet . . . That's 


 why. And he's hiding, and we're looking, and we will continue 


 to look until we bring him to justice.'' For me, somewhere 


 between two and four years removed from 9/11, it had all 


 begun to wear thin--especially because it seemed bin Laden 


 remained active. Unfortunately, the President's standard line 


 has long been accepted by the media and American people.



 Then, On May 20, 2007, the Times reported that we were 


 paying $80 million a month to Pakistan for its supposed 


 counter-terrorism efforts, for a total of $5.6 billion.



 In July 2007, a National Security Estimate concluded that 


 the failure of Musharraf's accord with warlords in Pakistan's 


 tribal areas had allowed bin Laden's thugs to regroup there. 


 On July 22, National Intelligence Director Adm. Mike 


 McConnell said on Meet the Press that he believed bin Laden 


 was in Pakistan in the very region Musharraf had ceded to the 


 warlords.



 I hoped that the presidential campaign would move the issue 


 to the front burner, but despite its 24/7 nature it failed to 


 stir up a discussion about the failure to capture or kill 


 those who pushed us down such a perilous path. In the first 


 seven presidential debates--four for the D's, three for the 


 R's--there was only one question in 15 hours of discourse 


 that touched on the subject of finding bin Laden in Pakistan, 


 and it came from the audience. Though I did not keep count 


 thereafter, I know that the issue never gained resonance in 


 any subsequent debate.



 Things changed somewhat on August 1, 2007, when Barack 


 Obama delivered a speech at the Woodrow Wilson International 


 Center for Scholars: ''If we have actionable intelligence 


 about high-value terrorist targets, and President Musharraf 


 won't act, we will,'' he said.



 ''We can't send millions and millions of dollars to 


 Pakistan for military aid, and be a constant ally to them, 


 and yet not see more aggressive action in dealing with al 


 Qaeda.''



 Finally, I thought, a presidential candidate saying 


 something about this foreign-policy failure.



 The reaction? Ridicule.



 Then presidential candidates Joe Biden and Chris Dodd 


 responded derisively. Pakistani foreign ministers did 


 likewise. Across the aisle, John McCain pounded Obama for a 


 perceived lack of seasoning in the realm of foreign 


 relations: ''The best idea is to not broadcast what you're 


 going to do,'' McCain said in February. ''That's naive.'' 


 (More recently, McCain has grown fond of saying that he'll 


 ''follow bin Laden to the gates of hell.'') Not to be left 


 out, Hillary Clinton said, ''You can think big, but, 


 remember, you shouldn't always say everything you think when 


 you're running for president because it could have 


 consequences across the world, and we don't need that right 


 now.''



 Of course, that didn't stop Senator Clinton from including 


 bin Laden's image--along with reminders of the attack on 


 Pearl Harbor--in a television commercial that aired in the 


 final days before the Pennsylvania primary election. After 


 scolding her opponent for advocating a specific course of 


 action in Pakistan, the world's most infamous terrorist 


 became a bankable issue for the junior senator from New York 


 when her back was against the wall.



 To his credit, Obama refused to back away from his 


 insistence on reasserting American control over the hunt for 


 bin Laden. I interviewed him on March 21, 2008, and he 


 admitted that a resurgence of the Taliban had occurred in 


 Pakistan.



 ''What's clear from . . . what I've learned from talking to 


 troops on the ground is that unless we can really pin down 


 some of these Taliban leaders who flee into the Pakistan 


 territories, we're going to continue to have instability, and 


 al Qaeda's going to continue to have a safe haven, and that's 


 not acceptable.''



 I was pleased by what he had to say about the issue, and 


 asked about it again on April 18, 2008, when I interviewed 


 him for a second time. He told me that Musharraf, despite 


 being flush with billions in American aid, was not taking 


 counter-terrorism seriously.



 ''That's part of the reason that I've been a critic from 


 the start of the war in Iraq,'' Obama told me. ''It's not 


 that I was opposed to war. It's that I felt we had a war that 


 we had not finished.''



 ''And al Qaeda is stronger now than at any time since 2001, 


 and we've got to do something about that because those guys 


 have a safe haven there and they are still planning to do 


 Americans harm.''



 He also pointed out that the Bush administration had 


 actually shown signs of following his lead. Obama reminded me 


 that a late-January airstrike killed a senior al Qaeda 


 commander in Pakistan, calling it an example of the type of 


 action he'd been recommending since August. The CIA, it was 


 reported a few weeks after the strike, acted without the 


 direct approval of Musharraf.



 Soon after I spoke with Senator Obama, the non-partisan 


 Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of 


 the United States Congress, issued a report dated April 17, 


 2008 with a title requiring no interpretation: ''Combating 


 Terrorism: The United States Lacks Comprehensive Plan to 


 Destroy the Terrorist Threat and Close the Safe Haven in 


 Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas.''



 The report, undertaken at the bipartisan request of U.S 


 House and Senate members, minced no words in issuing a 


 conclusion that should have made Americans' blood boil: Six 


 years after September 11, the United States had failed to 


 destroy the terrorist havens in




 Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas (known in the 


 report as FATA). The GAO confirmed prior reports that al 


 Qaeda was revitalized and poised to launch an attack, and 


 said that no comprehensive U.S. plan existed to combat 


 terrorism on its most central front.



 In the days that followed its release, I spoke to Charles 


 Johnson, under whose signature the GAO report was issued. He 


 told me: ''With respect to establishing a comprehensive plan, 


 we found that there were some individual plans that had been 


 prepared by the various entities I mentioned earlier [the 


 Department of Defense, Department of State, U.S. Agency for 


 International Development, among others].''



 ''But yet there was no comprehensive plan that integrated 


 all of the key elements of national power that was called for 


 by the 9/11 Commission, by the National Security Strategy for 


 Combating Terrorism and the United States Congress. And those 


 elements I'm referring to are: the use of military, economic 


 and development assistance; law enforcement support; 


 intelligence support; as well as political and diplomatic 


 means by which we would want to address the root cause of 


 terrorism in a particular region.''



 From there the headlines continued to defy the GAO 


 recommendations. ''Pakistan asserts it is near a deal with 


 militants,'' read the front page of the April 25 edition of 


 the New York Times. Pakistan's newly elected government was 


 again on the verge of an accord with the militants running 


 amok in the FATA--despite the new government's previously 


 stated desires to move away from Musharraf's policies in 


 those regions. Less than a week later, under the headline 


 ''Pakistan's planned accord with militants alarms U.S.,'' The 


 New York Times reported that the Bush administration 


 expressed concern that the new agreement could contribute to 


 ''further unraveling of security'' in the region.



 The arrangement was tailor made for bin Laden. It permitted 


 the local Taliban group, Tehrik-e-Taliban, to assist in 


 keeping law and order in the area known as Swat in the 


 northwest frontier province--while not attacking the existing 


 security forces--in return for an exchange of prisoners 


 between the Pakistani Army and the Taliban. The Army also 


 agreed to withdraw forces from parts of Swat. According to a 


 report from the May 22 edition of The New York Times, the 


 Bush Administration was concerned that the deal would ''give 


 the Taliban and Al Qaeda the latitude to carry out attacks 


 against American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.'' Some U.S. 


 officials even went so far as to call it a ''victory'' for 


 bin Laden, as reported by ABC News. What else are we to 


 assume, except that the climate in Pakistan may grow even 


 more hospitable to al Qaeda?



 In a refreshing opportunity free from the stock answers so 


 often given by politicians, I was given the chance to 


 interview Marcus Luttrell as part of my radio book club 


 series in May 2008. He was the only survivor of Operation Red 


 Wing, a mission that would result in the worst loss in Naval 


 Seal history. He earned a Navy Cross for his valor and wrote 


 about his harrowing story in The New York Times' best seller, 


 Lone Survivor. Unlike most of the bureaucrats from 


 Washington, who have only been able to offer me talking 


 points from a failed policy, Luttrell gave a brutally honest 


 account of the time he spent in the Hindu Kush, a mountainous 


 area located just a few miles from the northwestern border of 


 Pakistan. Luttrell described how his efforts were too often 


 constricted by red tape.



 ''Yeah, we've got some problems with that border . . . 


 because we'd be chasing the bad guys in there and they had a 


 lot of security set up and we have to stop what we're doing 


 while they just run across and if we don't, we'll get engaged 


 by the Paki border guards and that's an international 


 incident.''



 Luttrell couldn't delve into the details of the prickly 


 international problem that was created by the tension with 


 the border guard, but when I asked him if the Pakistan issue 


 was a problem in general, he wholeheartedly agreed.



 ''Hell yeah it's a problem. Heck, they're harboring the 


 enemy. It's such a joke, it's so stupid. [T]hey come over and 


 do their business, whatever is, and if it gets them in to 


 trouble, all they have to do is sink back into Pakistan and 


 stay there. They say, ''We're good here, we're good here' . . 


 . It's frustrating.''



 Americans may be uncertain about which talking point of the 


 day to believe on this issue, but I'm taking the word of a 


 guy who saw the conditions first-hand. Marcus Luttrell and 


 thousands of other men and women in uniform serve their 


 country valiantly. Don't we owe it to them to aggressively 


 pursue and kill the enemies that seek to destroy them?



 Supporting the account of Marcus Luttrell is a chilling 


 report released by the RAND Corporation, a think tank, on 


 June 9, 2008. The report warned that the ''United States and 


 its NATO allies will face crippling long-term consequences in 


 their effort to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan'' if it 


 does not eliminate Taliban strongholds in Pakistan.



 All of this while the presidential contenders and the 


 Americans headed to the polls were mostly silent in the face 


 of a seven year timeline moving in the wrong direction. For 


 his part, Ayman al-Zawahiri was apparently so comfortable 


 that he spent time logging into jihad chat rooms and 


 attracting thousands of questions from the peon terrorists 


 prepared to do his dirty work.



 All of this drives me batshit, and it just might drive me 


 into the Obama camp. That'd be quite a departure. I've been 


 active in the Republican Party since I turned eighteen and 


 registered to vote for Ronald Reagan in 1980. While a college 


 undergraduate at Lehigh University, I did advance work for 


 then Vice President George H.W. Bush. And soon after I 


 graduated from law school at the University of Pennsylvania, 


 Penn, he appointed me, at age 29, to run the Department of 


 Housing and Urban Development in five states under the 


 direction of Secretary Jack Kemp. I supported Bush 43 in both 


 of his campaigns. Hell, in 2004, I MC'd his final 


 Pennsylvania rally with 20,000 people in a suburban 


 cornfield.



 My frustration is so apparent that a fellow journalist from 


 The Philadelphia Daily News has labeled me ''fixated'' with 


 9/11. At least I'm consistent. In 2004, I donated all of my 


 proceeds from my first book, Flying Blind: How Political 


 Correctness Continues to Compromise Airline Safety Post 9/11, 


 to a memorial in Bucks County, Pennsylvania called the Garden 


 of Reflection for Ground Zero victims. Many of my radio 


 listeners bought that book. Now some of them pound out 


 hatriolic emails to my website because, on the strength of 


 this issue, I said Barack Obama was the better of the two 


 Democrats in the Pennsylvania primary.



 But frankly, I don't care.



 The Bush Administration's failure to orchestrate a 


 successful counter-terrorism plan--one topped off with 


 justice for Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri--has left 


 me embarrassed of my party and angry. The oft-repeated 


 explanations of the search being nuanced or covering 


 difficult terrain should have worn thin long ago.



 Unfortunately, even after dangling my vote in front of 


 Senator John McCain, the nominee from my own party, he only 


 offered a continuation of the Bush Administration's policy. 


 In a conversation I had with the Senator on June 13, 2008, he 


 first attempted to say that our counterterrorism efforts were 


 working and that remaining on good terms with Pakistan was 


 imperative to our safety.



 ''There has been progress in those areas. Pakistan is a 


 sovereign nation and we have to have the cooperation of 


 Pakistan in order to have these operations succeed. I don't 


 have any classified information, but I do know that there are 


 activities taking place that are intended to counter some of 


 these activities, so all I want to say to you is that if you 


 alienate Pakistan and it turns into an anti-American 


 government, then you will have much greater difficulties.''



 Even when the Senator attempted to remind me of the fact 


 that the United States also gives a great deal of money to 


 Egypt, who, like Pakistan, could be more helpful in assisting 


 the U.S. in the War on Terror, I pointed out to him that 


 these guys aren't hiding in Cairo. The people responsible for 


 the atrocities of 9/11 are concentrated in an area 


 northwestern Pakistan, a fact which I repeated to the 


 Senator. He then pointed out the historic difficulty with the 


 region.



 ''I have promised that I will get Osama bin Laden when I am 


 President of the United States, but . . . you can go on the 


 internet, and look at that countryside, and there's a reason 


 why it hasn't been governed since the days of Alexander the 


 Great. They're ruled by about, it's my understanding, 


 thirteen tribal entities, and nobody has ever governed them, 


 not the Pakistani government, not the British--nobody, and so 


 it's a very, very difficult part of the world.'' He added, 


 ''I agree with you that we should've gotten Osama bin Laden, 


 but I can't put all of it at the doorstep of the Pakastani 


 government.''



 I have a great deal of respect for the Senator, but I have 


 a serious disagreement with him over this issue, something 


 which I let him know would dramatically influence my vote in 


 November. For the entirety of my interview, I tried to keep 


 the Senator focused on Pakistan, and though he answered all 


 of my questions, at the end of the interview, the Senator 


 tried to insert his message of the day, which was about the 


 Supreme Court ruling that granted habeas corpus rights to 


 enemy combatants. When he did, I responded, ''I hear you, and 


 all I think is that the guys who sent those guys over here 


 are still on the lamb and we're writing a big check, and I'm 


 unhappy about it.'' To my disappointment, the Senator said 


 the following, ''Yes, sir, and I understand that, and if you 


 let KSM, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, and others go, they'll join 


 them over there. Thirty guys, who have been released, have 


 gone back to the battlefield.'' It wasn't the fact that he 


 once again dodged my clear dissatisfaction with the Pakistan 


 issue that left me dismayed--I've become quite used to it at 


 this point; it was the fact that I clearly heard an aide 


 mutter the line to him before he delivered it before me and 


 my captive audience. The campaign clearly had a stock answer 


 for me, an answer that I've heard before and have clearly 


 rejected.



 Put quite simply, the support for this failed policy is 


 driving me to the edge of my long Republican career. And 


 despite never pulling a lever for a Democratic presidential 


 candidate, I believe the election this November will present 


 the chance to relieve this country of the conventional wisdom 


 that President Bush has offered for seven years and Senator 


 McCain appears resigned to advance: That President Musharraf 


 was a friend who did what he could to prevent Pakistan from 


 defaulting towards further extremism; that the hunt for Osama 


 bin Laden is nuanced and U.S. forces are doing everything 


 they can to find him; and that the war




 in Iraq is a necessary one that hasn't distracted from the 


 fight against those who perpetrated and planned 9/11.



 That wisdom has been proven unequivocally wrong.



 The kicker? We, the tax payers, are footing the bill for 


 this negligence. According to a June 25, 2008 article in The 


 Philadelphia Inquirer, a GAO report showed that nearly two 


 billion given in aid to Pakistan was spent improperly. The 


 article states:



 '' 'For a large number of claims, Defense did not obtain 


 sufficient documentation from Pakistan to verify that claimed 


 costs were incremental, actually incurred or correctly 


 calculated,' the report concluded. 'It seems as though the 


 Pakistani military went on a spending spree with American 


 taxpayers' wallets and no one bothered to investigate the 


 charges,' said Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), a member of the 


 Senate Appropriations Committee. 'How hard would it have been 


 to confirm that a road we paid $15 million for was ever 


 built?' ''



 The leaks about our Pakistani misadventures continued. It 


 was reported in The New York Times on June 30, 2008 that the 


 Bush Administration had created a secret plan in late 2007 to 


 settle disagreements between counterterrorism agencies that 


 were blocking the path of special ops forces into Pakistan. 


 Months after the plan was developed, however, the special ops 


 are still waiting, entangled in bureaucratic red tape. As 


 these highly-trained soldiers, who should be on the prowl for 


 Osama bin Laden, sit with their hands tied, al Qaeda's 


 presence has grown. According to the Times:



 ''After the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush committed the 


 nation to a 'war on terrorism' and made the destruction of 


 Mr. bin Laden's network the top priority of his presidency. 


 But it is increasingly clear that the Bush administration 


 will leave office with Al Qaeda having successfully relocated 


 its base from Afghanistan to Pakistan's tribal areas, where 


 it has rebuilt much of its ability to attack from the region 


 and broadcast its messages to militants across the world.''



 In light of increasingly negative press about Afghanistan, 


 both the Obama and McCain campaigns addressed the issue in 


 foreign policy speeches on July 15, 2008. Senator Obama was 


 first up to bat. Here's some of what he said:




 ''In the 18 months since the surge began, the situation in 


 Afghanistan has deteriorated. June was our highest casualty 


 month of the war. The Taliban has been on the offensive, even 


 launching a brazen attack on one of our bases. Al Qaeda has a 


 growing sanctuary in Pakistan. That is a consequence of our 


 current strategy.''



 ''In fact--as should have been apparent to President Bush 


 and Senator McCain--the central front in the war on terror is 


 not Iraq, and it never was. That's why the second goal of my 


 new strategy will be taking the fight to al Qaeda in 


 Afghanistan and Pakistan.



 ''It is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly 


 3,000 Americans were killed on our soil, the terrorists who 


 attacked us on 9/11 are still at large. Osama bin Laden and 


 Ayman al-Zawahari are recording messages to their followers 


 and plotting more terror. The Taliban controls parts of 


 Afghanistan. Al Qaeda has an expanding base in Pakistan that 


 is probably no farther from their old Afghan sanctuary than a 


 train ride from Washington to Philadelphia. If another attack 


 on our homeland comes, it will likely come from the same 


 region where 9/11 was planned. And yet today, we have five 


 times more troops in Iraq than Afghanistan.''



 ''The greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal 


 regions of Pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents 


 strike into Afghanistan. We cannot tolerate a terrorist 


 sanctuary, and as President, I won't. We need a stronger and 


 sustained partnership between Afghanistan, Pakistan and NATO 


 to secure the border, to take out terrorist camps, and to 


 crack down on cross-border insurgents. We need more troops, 


 more helicopters, more satellites, more Predator drones in 


 the Afghan border region. And we must make it clear that if 


 Pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level 


 terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our 


 sights.''



 ''Make no mistake: we can't succeed in Afghanistan or 


 secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy. We 


 must expect more of the Pakistani government, but we must 


 offer more than a blank check to a General who has lost the 


 confidence of his people. It's time to strengthen stability 


 by standing up for the aspirations of the Pakistani people. 


 That's why I'm cosponsoring a bill with Joe Biden and Richard 


 Lugar to triple non-military aid to the Pakistani people and 


 to sustain it for a decade, while ensuring that the 


 military assistance we do provide is used to take the 


 fight to the Taliban and al Qaeda. We must move beyond a 


 purely military alliance built on convenience, or face 


 mounting popular opposition in a nuclear-armed nation at 


 the nexus of terror and radical Islam.''



 ''Only a strong Pakistani democracy can help us move toward 


 my third goal--securing all nuclear weapons and materials 


 from terrorists and rogue states. One of the terrible ironies 


 of the Iraq War is that President Bush used the threat of 


 nuclear terrorism to invade a country that had no active 


 nuclear program. But the fact that the President misled us 


 into a misguided war doesn't diminish the threat of a 


 terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction--in fact, it has 


 only increased it.''



 Senator McCain offered a different view:



 ''A special focus of our regional strategy must be 


 Pakistan, where terrorists today enjoy sanctuary. This must 


 end. We must strengthen local tribes in the border areas who 


 are willing to fight the foreign terrorists there--the 


 strategy used successfully in Anbar and elsewhere in Iraq. We 


 must convince Pakistanis that this is their war as much as it 


 is ours. And we must empower the new civilian government of 


 Pakistan to defeat radicalism with greater support for 


 development, health, and education. Senator Obama has spoken 


 in public about taking unilateral military action in 


 Pakistan. In trying to sound tough, he has made it harder for 


 the people whose support we most need to provide it. I will 


 not bluster, and I will not make idle threats. But understand 


 this: when I am commander-in-chief, there will be nowhere the 


 terrorists can run, and nowhere they can hide.''



 My ranting and raving on this issue seems to have caught 


 the attention of the national campaigns. In June 2008, the 


 Obama campaign used my praise of the candidate to supplement 


 their fact check section of the website on the Senator's 


 quest to catch bin Laden.



 It became apparent that the Obama campaign wasn't the only 


 one to take notice; the interview I had done with Senator 


 McCain in June 2008, and general ire with the Republican 


 establishment on this issue, had obviously raised some red 


 flags over at the campaign. On July 24, 2008, former Mayor 


 Rudy Giuliani appeared on the program at his own request. 


 Though I was thrilled to have Rudy back to the show, as he 


 was my first choice out of the Republican presidential 


 candidates, it was clear that he was sent as a surrogate of 


 the McCain camp. Realizing this, I told Rudy exactly what was 


 keeping me from enthusiastically supporting McCain. 


 Specifically, I referenced a story that had run in The New 


 York Times that morning, describing the Bush Administration's 


 plan to divert $230 billion dollars in aid to Pakistan, which 


 was intended to be used for a variety of military purposes. 


 According to the Times, the money would be used for 


 everything, ''from counterterrorism programs to upgrading 


 that country's aging F-16 attack planes, which Pakistan 


 prizes more for their contribution to its military rivalry 


 with India than for fighting insurgents along its Afghan 


 border.'' In my opinion, it looked like we were continuing to 


 fund a country that had already grossly mismanaged the effort 


 to find bin Laden, and doing so while knowing that the funds 


 would be used to embolden the Pakistani army with regard to 


 the age-old conflict with India. When I asked the former 


 Mayor how he, the leader most defined by the 9/11 attacks, 


 could tolerate this sort of negligence, I ended my question 


 by telling him that I thought we were getting ''rolled.'' He 


 agreed with my analysis at story's face value, but qualified 


 his comments, ''I don't know what the background of this one 


 is. On the face of it, it makes no sense. Pakistan does not 


 face an imminent threat from India. India is becoming a 


 closer and closer ally. I think one of the good things the 


 Bush Administration has done is really turned it to a very 


 positive one, particularly with this deal regarding the use 


 of fuel that can be used for nuclear reactors, but the only 


 was this would make sense, is if it's part of an overall deal 


 to get them to allow us the leeway [to get bin Laden] we were 


 just talking about.''



 I agreed with his analysis of this one instance, but after 


 a long train of abuses involving Pakistan, it's difficult to 


 keep an open mind. No campaign will ever be able to convince 


 me that we haven't dropped the ball in Pakistan, and have 


 disgraced the memories of the 9/11 victims in doing so.



 While candidates talk, the dismaying story continues. A 


 recent report from The New York Times in July 2008 suggested 


 that the C.I.A. might not even be receiving proper 


 intelligence on the al Qaeda problem in Pakistan: ''The 


 C.I.A. has depended heavily on the ISI for information about 


 militants in Pakistan, despite longstanding concerns about 


 divided loyalties within the Pakistani spy service, which had 


 close relations with the Taliban in Afghanistan before the 


 Sept. 11 attacks. That ISI officers have maintained important 


 ties to anti-American militants has been the subject of 


 previous reports in The New York Times. But the C.I.A. and 


 the Bush administration have generally sought to avoid 


 criticism of Pakistan, which they regard as a crucial ally in 


 the fight against terrorism.'' It was reported two days later 


 that officers from this same intelligence service played a 


 role in the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul, 


 Afghanistan on July 7, 2008, which left fifty-four people 


 dead.



 Still not convinced that Pakistan is knowingly harboring 


 the people working full-time to attack us? On August 12, 


 2008, Abu Saeed al-Masri, a senior al Qaeda commander was 


 killed in an American air strike. Where? The border between 


 Afghanistan and Pakistan, of course.



 When President Musharaff resigned in August 2008 due to 


 political pressure from lingering doubts as to his legitimacy 


 from the previous election, President Bush offered undue 


 praise for the former President. A statement said, 


 ''President Bush appreciates President Musharraf's efforts in 


 the democratic transition of Pakistan as well as his 


 commitment to fighting al Qaeda and extremist groups.'' 


 Commitment? What a farce.



 I say that because the weeks following Musharraf's 


 resignation have already brought incremental changes in 


 policy and




 faint reasons for optimism. The Pakistani military spent most 


 of August launching airstrikes against the Taliban militants 


 attacking American forces from the fence straddling the 


 Afghan-Pakistan border--an effort that resulted in more than 


 400 Taliban casualties and a shallow retreat by the 


 terrorists. It's ''shallow'' because the Pakistani government 


 followed up those airstrikes by declaring a ceasefire to 


 coincide with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Legislators 


 from the tribal areas promised political support for the top 


 candidate in Pakistan's presidential election in exchange for 


 the truce, which was announced in the days leading up to the 


 country's vote.



 Less than a week later, though, American forces finally 


 showed signs of taking the matter of the central front of the 


 war on terror into their own hands. A New York Times report 


 indicated that U.S. special ops forces attacked al-Qaeda 


 militants gathered in a Pakistani village called Jalal Khel. 


 U.S. officials said the move might represent the early stages 


 of a more dedicated and aggressive American presence in 


 Pakistan in the wake of General Musharraf's resignation.



 Don't get me wrong, a more sustained United States assault 


 against the terrorists squatting in Pakistan is welcome news, 


 and it signifies a more urgent effort to hunt down and snuff 


 out the greatest threat to Americans' safety on our own 


 shores.



 But it's about 2,555 days late and $11 billion short. Seven 


 years after 9/11, the country is stoking what was supposed to 


 be a complete and consuming ''war on terror'' with faint 


 signs of a sustained operation in the country where the bad 


 guys have been hiding for years.



 How appalling. I doubt the families of the 3,000 innocents 


 murdered on 9/11--and the 4,000 that followed them in Iraq--


 are content with it. After all, it's seven years, thousands 


 of troops and billions of dollars later, and our country has 


 failed to deliver on what we really owe them: Justice.



 Nor have we answered the most important question pertaining 


 to our nation's future: Can we really win this war with 


 Islamic extremism? Because if we don't have the fire in our 


 belly to defend the American troops stonewalled by the 


 Afghan-Pakistani border; to hunt down and destroy the Taliban 


 and al-Qaeda militants camping out on the other side of that 


 border; and do everything we possibly can to capture and kill 


 Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, I fear we'll be left 


 to deal with another fire--one raging in another building, 


 burning a hole in another American city.
