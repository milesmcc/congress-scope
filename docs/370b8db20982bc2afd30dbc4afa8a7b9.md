# IRAQ DEBATE
## `370b8db20982bc2afd30dbc4afa8a7b9`
`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 31 January 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with regard to today's schedule, we 
will be working, as the majority leader indicated, on the timing of the 
Kyl amendments. These are important amendments which we are going to 
want to have considered in a timely fashion. Senator Kyl will need to 
be able to debate those amendments. We


probably will be able to get to final passage tomorrow.

And then, as the majority leader indicated, he and I have had 
extensive discussions about crafting the various proposals, how many we 
are going to have on each side to address the most important issue in 
the country right now, which is the Iraq war, and that debate, of 
course, will occur next week. So we will continue our discussions 
toward narrowing down and understanding fully exactly which 
resolutions, alternate resolutions will need a vote in the context of 
that debate.
