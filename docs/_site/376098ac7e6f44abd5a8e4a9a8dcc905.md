Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, our treasurer says we would not be able 
to sell voter-approved highway, school, and water bonds that are 
desperately needed for California's economy and for the creation of 
good-paying new jobs. He says they would not be able to get the credit.

California also desperately needs access to short-term borrowing from 
banks to finance our budget.

Now, how did we get here? There are a lot of people saying don't 
point fingers and don't talk about it. I am going to talk about it. It 
was deregulation fever. That is my opinion. It started in the 1980s, 
with lawmakers interfering with Federal regulators over the savings and 
loan crisis. It continued in 1995, when the Republicans took over and 
they wanted to place a moratorium on all new regulations.

That effort failed, but their success came in 1999, when Senator Phil 
Gramm and his allies tore down the firewalls that separated various 
financial institutions. And then the deregulation of the energy 
business. You all remember Enron and those traders--that is T-R-A-D-E-
R-S--saying: Well, grandma can't pay the bill, isn't it funny?

Phil Gramm recently said we are a nation of whiners. I say his legacy 
is a disaster.

I believe, and I hope, this package will do what is needed to restore 
trust in the short term. For the long term, we need regulatory reform 
and change that will bring us job-producing investments in America, not 
in foreign lands. Remember, $10 billion a month is going to Iraq. We 
need those dollars here at home.

So I look forward to that work on behalf of my great State of 
California and this great Nation.

I yield the floor.
