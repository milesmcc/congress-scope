`Mr. REID â€” 26 March 2009`

---


Mr. REID. The President will brief the bipartisan group of Senators 
on what is going on in Afghanistan. It is a report that has been 
completed. I mention that because that takes place at 1 p.m. today. 
There will be a lot of difficulty in scheduling votes here today.

In addition, there is a 4 p.m. Senators-only briefing with Ambassador 
Richard Holbrooke to talk about Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are going 
to try our best to finish this bill, so everyone be patient. I have had 
extended conversations with Senator Hatch. It is very doubtful whether 
we will have to try to invoke cloture on this. I think people have had 
opportunities to offer amendments.

If there are other amendments to be offered today, I hope Senators 
will do it quickly so we can schedule the debate and votes on those. We 
have had a good week on this important, truly bipartisan piece of 
legislation, with heavy bipartisan support.
