`Mr. BIDEN â€” 28 March 2007`

---


Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I wish to begin by stating very simply 
that this amendment is literally, not figuratively, a matter of life 
and death. I have been here for many years. I have never begun a 
discussion of an amendment--and I have sponsored some serious 
amendments and pieces of legislation--by saying something as graphic 
and drastic as this is literally a matter of life and death. But it is. 
This is not hyperbole. This is not an exaggeration.

What my amendment will do is allow the military to put 2,500 more 
mine resistant ambush protected vehicles--known in the military by its 
acronym, MRAP--in the field by the end of this year.

Now, let me explain what I am talking about. First, I want to point 
out that the committee acknowledged the need for these vehicles and 
included $2.5 billion in this bill. But what I propose in this 
amendment is forward-funding money from next year's 2008 budget into 
this supplemental. In that way, we can build more of these vehicles 
which have one purpose--the specific purpose of saving lives, American 
lives.

The fact is, as most of my colleagues know, 70 percent of American 
casualties in Iraq are caused by improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.

Many of my colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, have been to 
Iraq. They have had the same experience I have in my seven trips--
visiting field hospitals. There, you see amputees and people with 
serious head injuries who, because of the incredible skill and triage 
capability of our military doctors and nurses, are able to be kept 
alive. Most of those injured at Walter Reed and at Bethesda naval 
hospital are victims of these devices, sadly now familiar to all 
Americans from the nightly news. We have tried very hard--although this 
administration has done so belatedly--to better equip our troops to 
withstand IEDs. God forbid they find themselves victim of an IED 
attack, but if they do, we want them to be able to survive.

MRAP vehicles provide four to five times more protection to our 
troops than up-armored HMMWVs. That statement, that these MRAPs provide 
four to five times more protection than up-armored HMMWVs, is not my 
estimate. That is the judgment of our military leaders. The Commandant 
of the Marine Corps, GEN James Conway, with whom I spoke as recently as 
this afternoon, wrote on March 1 to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. He said:




 Multi-National Forces--West [that is, the Marines in Iraq] 


 estimates that the use of the MRAP could reduce the 


 casualties in vehicles due to IED attack by as much as 80 


 percent.


He went on further and said that even though the MRAP is not 
expeditionary:




 It is, however, the best available vehicle for force 


 protection.


He concluded by saying:




 Getting the MRAP into the Al Anbar Province is my number 


 one unfilled warfighting requirement at this time.


Let me repeat that:




 Getting the MRAP into the Al Anbar Province is my number 


 one unfilled warfighting requirement at this time.


He went on to tell me today that although there is some disagreement 
in terms of priorities within this building, he was speaking to me from 
the Pentagon, he said, ''I believe this is a moral imperative.''

How many generals with four stars or three or two or one on their 
shoulders have you heard use that phrase? How often is something so 
fundamental it is called ''a moral imperative''? This is a man who is 
heading back out to Iraq soon. He is talking about protecting his kids, 
his troops.

On my last trip into Anbar Province last summer, I went to Fallujah. 
I met with the commanding Marine general and roughly 30 to 40 of his 
commanders and noncommissioned officers. I was taken outside a building 
to see what they were trying to do to diminish the casualty rate of 
American forces required to patrol Fallujah. They showed me what they 
called a rhino, a big vehicle, looks like a Caterpillar bulldozer with 
a great big proboscis on it, a great big arm that is used when an IED 
is identified, to disarm it. It was interesting. I observed for the 
first time--maybe others knew about it--the hull. The bottom of it 
looked like a ship out of water. It had a V-shaped bottom. A humvee, 
like your SUV or your automobile, has a flat bottom. In a humvee, even 
if it is reinforced, it is still flat. The rhino had a V-shaped bottom 
or floor. I asked why. They said it made them much more blast resistant 
and it could protect the troops inside. That is the first time I heard 
about this concept. They did not have MRAPs yet, but they had this 
rhino, a much bigger vehicle for a different purpose.

As I talked to them, I remember asking the question, why aren't we 
building more of these things? You know, the folks on the ground, these 
kids and many not so young women and men who are climbing into these 
coffins, know that even in an up-armored vehicle if they are struck, 
deadly force may be exerted, scrambling their brains or outright 
killing them. The number one requirement of the Commandant of the 
Marine Corps is to get more of these vehicles. I respectfully suggest 
to all who care--and every one of us cares about the fate of the 
troops--if there is any place we should not consider the cost--
emphasize again, not consider the cost--it is when there is a consensus 
that what we are purchasing can save lives. We have made no sacrifice 
in this country to fight this war except for the families of those who 
have gone to the war. We should not hesitate to save the lives of those 
who are sacrificing because of cost.

A couple of my colleagues off the floor, none of whom are on the 
floor at this moment, have told me it might not be cost effective 
because the military is working on a new vehicle. Give me a break. Cost 
effective? I wonder how many people asked, when we were talking about 
the invasion of Normandy in World War II: You know, we better be 
careful. We may build too many landing craft. We might have some left 
over. What are we going to do with them after the war?

We have no higher obligation than to protect those we send into 
battle. We have received a pretty good dose of this administration's 
willingness to send people into battle not prepared. Rumsfeld's famous 
comment: You go with the Army you have, not the Army you like or need. 
That is paraphrasing him from a couple of years ago. When we find a way 
to protect people better in battle, then it seems to me we have an 
overwhelming obligation to act.

Let me explain the specifics of the MRAP. Each vehicle can hold 4 to 
12 troops. Like the rhino, these vehicles have raised steel, V-shaped 
hulls and chassis. The raised hull is valuable because it gives the 
blast more time to expand, lessening the impact. The V-shape pushes the 
blast up the sides of the vehicle and away from the occupants. With an 
up-armored HMMWV or any humvee, the flat bottom sends the blast through 
the floor right into the occupants. In addition, the vehicles have side 
armor and bulletproof glass, and they also have tires that can be 
driven when flat.

Ever since the military began using MRAPs in Iraq, the requirement 
has grown, as commanders realize how much better they are at protecting 
their personnel. In May of last year the requirement was only 185. By 
July, it had risen to 1,185. By November, it had risen to 4,060. By 
February of this year, after the supplemental request was submitted, it 
rose to 6,738. One month later, the requirement went up again to the 
current level of 7,774. At this point every one in the military agrees, 
we need 7,774 MRAPs.

The Marines are the executive agents for this program, meaning they 
are


managing it for themselves and the other services. Every service has a 
need for the vehicle for explosive ordinance units as well as regular 
patrols. The Marines need 3,700 of them. The Army needs 2,500. The Air 
Force needs 697. The Navy needs 544, and the Special Operations Command 
needs 333. The cost of 7,774 MRAPs is $8.4 billion. This 
administration's current plan is to spend $2.3 billion this year and 
$6.1 billion next year. But I believe we can and must do much better, 
and so do the Marines. If we simply put more funds up front, spend them 
in the supplemental rather than allocate them a year later in the 2008 
budget, the same money that we are going to spend anyway next year, if 
we move it up, we can accelerate production drastically.

Some have said the extra production capacity does not exist. Again, 
speaking to the Commandant of the Marine Corps today, he indicated that 
there are eight companies they are dealing with and he has confidence 
that they can build all they can purchase, all they can afford. That is 
also what the Chief of Staff of the Army thinks.

On March 14, General Peter Schoomaker told the Appropriations 
Committee that with the MRAPs, ''We can build what we get the funds to 
build. It is strictly an issue of money.''

Let's assume the Commandant of the Marine Corps and General 
Schoomaker are wrong. Let's assume they have made a mistake. Let's 
assume we can't build as many as the money we give them. So what. So 
what. We are not talking about building a highway on time. We are 
talking about an informed judgment by the United States military, to 
build not a new weapons system, but to build a new protection system 
for their forces.

I respectfully suggest, if we are going to err on one side or the 
other, for God's sake, for a change, let's err on the side of doing 
something that will protect American fighting women and men.

Quite frankly, if the Marines believe we can do it, then my money is 
on the Marines getting it right. If General Schoomaker says he needs 
it, and more money will get the vehicles, then I take him at his word. 
I would rather take a chance, and I believe the American people would 
also, to protect more Americans under fire than not.

What does this mean specifically? Well, by adding $1.5 billion, which 
my amendment does, to the supplemental today, the Marines will have $4 
billion to work with. Based on their estimates, that will mean 2,500 
vehicles get to the field 6 months sooner than under the current plan. 
You may say: What is 6 months? Ten of thousands of lives is what 6 
months is. Figure it out: Four to twelve people in 2,500 more vehicles. 
Add up the numbers. That's 10,000 to 30,000 Americans. Look at the 
casualty rates that come from IEDs striking up-armored HMMWVs. Do the 
math, and tell me if their lives are not worth taking a financial risk 
to protect.

If we move this money forward, on October 1 of this year, instead of 
having only 2,000 MRAPs, we would have 4,500 in the field. On January 
1, 2008, instead of 3,500 MRAPs, we would have 6,000 in the field. By 
February, we would fulfill the entire requirement, instead of waiting 
until next July. We are still going to spend $8.4 billion, but spending 
it faster will make a major difference.

If you want to be callous about this, it would also save the American 
taxpayers a whole lot of money because for every one of those injured 
soldiers who comes back--to put it in Machiavellian terms--who needs a 
lifetime of medical care, there are hundreds of thousands of dollars 
committed per casualty.

I can find no logical argument for delaying this.

Let me end where I began. This is a matter of life and death. Madam 
President, 2,500 more vehicles means literally that 10,000 to 30,000 
more Americans will have a four to five times greater chance of 
surviving a hit with an IED while on patrol than exists today if we do 
not act. Madam President, 10,000 to 30,000 Americans will not be added 
to the casualty and death numbers if we move this money up.

To use the phrase of the Commandant of the Marine Corps, at 3 or 4 
o'clock today, on the phone with me:




 This is a moral imperative.


I agree. It is a moral imperative that we protect these troops as 
soon as possible.

So tomorrow, when I have my 1 or 2 minutes to speak to this issue 
before we vote, I will urge all my colleagues to vote for this 
amendment.

I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.
