Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speaker, I rise today to join in the 
celebration of Syttende Mai, or Norwegian Constitution Day.

On May 17, 1814, an assembly of Norway's leaders signed a 
Constitution declaring Norway's independence and establishing a 
government that was radically democratic for its time, especially in 
Europe.

This Sunday, exactly 195 years later, millions of Norwegians will 
gather to celebrate their independence, their long history of 
constitutional democracy, and their national achievements.

Norwegians and Norwegian Americans across our country will celebrate 
at smaller, but no less joyful, Constitution Day events. In my home 
State of Washington, the Norwegian Ambassador to the U.S. will serve as 
the Grand Marshal of a Constitution Day parade.

The United States and Norway share in the celebration of Constitution 
Day because we have a strong diplomatic friendship, a robust trading 
relationship, and a shared history of commitment to democratic 
principles.

Moreover, the U.S. and Norway are military partners. Today in 
Afghanistan, as a for instance, Norwegian soldiers are fighting the 
Taliban and al Qaeda alongside U.S. servicemembers.

So I congratulate Norway on this Constitution Day and look forward to 
celebrating Syttende Mai with them for years to come.
