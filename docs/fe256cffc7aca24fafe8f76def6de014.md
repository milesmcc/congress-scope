Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, over the past year, I have become 
increasingly concerned about veterans access to benefits, care and job 
training. We must encourage soldiers completing their active duty 
service to sign up with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. This 
is a critical message we must reiterate to all our returning service 
men and women.

As the heroes of our country, we believe our veterans and their 
families deserve the very best benefits to ensure peace of mind. With 
this in mind, Congress has provided more than 185,000 servicemembers 
and veterans with $500 for every month they were forced to serve under 
stop-loss orders since 2001. In addition, we've created new claims 
processors to make sure our veterans earn their benefits in a timely 
manner. We built new transition centers for wounded warriors, more 
military child care centers, and better barracks and military family 
housing. With veterans' families in mind, Congress has increased 
support for veteran caregivers. And lastly, those disabled veterans can 
rest assured that their benefits will keep pace with the cost of living 
and their needs.

Today I rise in support of S. 1963, the Caregivers and Veterans 
Omnibus Health Services Act. This landmark legislation will provide 
support to family and others who care for disabled, ill, or injured 
veterans; will enhance health services for the 1.8 million women 
veterans, including care for newborns for the first time in history; to 
expand mental health services for veterans and health care access for 
veterans in rural areas; and to prohibit copayments for veterans who 
are catastrophically disabled.

To help meet the many hardships and sacrifices associated with 
lengthy recovery and rehabilitation from severe injuries of veterans, 
S. 1963 will provide support services to family and other caregivers of 
veterans, including education on how to be a better caregiver, 
counseling and mental health services, and respite care for family and 
other caregivers of all veterans. It also provides health care and a 
stipend for caregivers living with severely wounded veterans of Iraq 
and Afghanistan.

This support is vital for the wounded veterans of Iraq and 
Afghanistan and their families, as about 20 percent of active duty, 15 
percent of reserve and 25 percent of retired and separated members have 
a family member or friend who has been forced to leave a job to care 
for the veteran full-time, according to the Dole/Shalala report.

The bill also expands and improves VA health care services for the 
women who have bravely served their country, working to remove existing 
barriers to women veterans seeking health care, providing up to seven 
days of care of newborn children of women veterans for the first time 
in history, and enhancing treatment for sexual trauma for women at the 
VA.

I urge my colleagues to vote ''yes'' in favor of this historic 
legislation for the sake of our heroes and their families. Our veterans 
deserve our gratitude and support at the very least.
