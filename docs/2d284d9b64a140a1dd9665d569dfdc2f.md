Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. You know, we shouldn't even be discussing 
surrender in Iraq today because 2 months ago today, three American 
soldiers were captured in Iraq. Tragically, the body of Private First 
Class Anzack was found a few days later in the river. DOD has changed 
the status of Specialist Jimenez and Private Fouty from unknown to 
missing/captured. Considering that the military found their IDs in an 
al Qaeda safe house, I'm sure they're being mistreated. And I hope and 
pray that they can stay alive until we can rescue them.

As a former prisoner of war for nearly 7 years in Vietnam, I know 
what these guys are going through. We must find them, and we must bring 
them home. Naysayers in Washington should not be talking about pulling 
the plug on our troops in Iraq when we have our own men missing in 
action who need to be rescued.
