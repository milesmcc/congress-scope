`Mr. ELLISON â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, the days of this House rubber-stamping 
President Bush's failed war policies have ended. So far this year, 
House and Senate committees have held over 52 hearings on Iraq. And now 
this week, over a 4-day period here on the House floor, we will be 
debating the President's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq.

The bipartisan bill is simple. It states that the House will continue 
to support our troops, but that we oppose the President's troop 
increase plan. Some of my Republican colleagues say that if you really 
support the troops, you must support the President's plan. But this 
makes no sense.

Do my colleagues not realize that our troops in Iraq were polled on 
the President's plan? Only 41 percent of them supported it. Not even a 
majority of our troops say that this plan of the President's is a good 
plan. What about our generals? Both retired and active duty military 
leaders have said that the President's plan will not reverse the 
devastating civil war that is now taking place in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, it is time that we listen to those military leaders and 
our troops and voice our opposition to the President's plan.
