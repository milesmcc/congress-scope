# THE BLUE DOG COALITION

`Mr. ROSS â€” 16 January 2007`

Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, on behalf of the 44 member 
strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog coalition, I rise to 
spend an hour this evening talking with you and Members of this body 
about the Blue Dog Coalition's desire to restore fiscal discipline and 
common sense to our national government.

Over the next hour, we plan as members of the fiscally conservative 
Democratic Blue Dog coalition to talk on this floor about the Blue Dog 
Coalition's 12-point plan for budget reform. We plan to discuss our 
accountability measures, because we believe it is time to restore 
accountability, fiscal discipline, and common sense to our national 
government.

Before I begin the formal presentation this evening, and will be 
joined by other members of the Blue Dog Coalition, I would like to take 
a moment to recognize Sergeant Marcus Wilson. Sergeant Wilson grew up 
in Dermott, Arkansas, in southeast Arkansas, in our congressional 
district back home.

This afternoon I had the honor to go to Walter Reed Army Hospital 
where I was able to sit down and visit with Sergeant Wilson and his 
wife and his son and thank him for his service to our country. He is 
there because of injuries suffered in Iraq.

Before that he served in Afghanistan. All of us have different ideas 
about what we should be doing with this post-war Iraq policy. But one 
of the things that I believe is absolutely critical and important is 
that as Members of this Congress, and as American citizens, that we 
remain united in support of our men and women in uniform. This evening 
I pay tribute to Sergeant Marcus Wilson of Dermott, Arkansas, and thank 
him for his service to our country and pray for him as he recovers from 
injuries he suffered in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I wish you could have been with me there this afternoon 
in conversations with Sergeant Wilson because he makes all Americans 
proud with his attitude, his attitude of perseverance, his attitude of 
service to our country as a soldier in the United States Marines. 
Again, I pay tribute and salute Sergeant Wilson.

Mr. Speaker, on this day my brother-in-law leaves to go to 
Kyrgyzstan, which is the entry point for Afghanistan, much like Kuwait 
is the entry point for Iraq, for his second mission there. I hope that 
all of us will keep him and all our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and 
elsewhere across this globe in our hearts and in our prayers.

Mr. Speaker, the underlying purpose of the fiscally conservative Blue 
Dog Coalition is to demand a balanced budget in this country. Mr. 
Speaker, it was not too long ago from 1998 through 2001 that we had a 
President named Bill Clinton, from my native State, from my home State, 
who gave us a balanced budget.

One of the ways he did that was with PAYGO rules in place on the 
floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, rules that the Republican 
leadership threw out after they took control of the House and Senate 
and the White House in 2001, the beginning of the 107th Congress.

What we have witnessed over the past 6 years has been absolutely 
staggering, if not startling. We have seen the largest deficit year 
after year after year until we have accumulated the largest debt ever 
in our Nation's history.

As members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog 
Coalition, we are committed through our 12-point plan for budget reform 
and through our accountability package to restore fiscal discipline to 
our Nation's government.

As we begin this evening, today the U.S. national debt is 
$8,701,316,295,722.43. We ran out of room. For every man, woman and 
child in America, their share, your share of the national debt, 
$29,035.60, what we refer to as the debt tax, d-e-b-t, which is one tax 
that cannot be repealed, cannot be cut until we go away and get our 
Nation's fiscal house in order.

If this is not startling enough, what's even more alarming is the 
fact that our Nation is borrowing about $1 billion a day. On top of 
that, we are spending about half a billion every day paying interest on 
the debt we have already got before it increases by another $1 billion 
a day. It is important that we get our fiscal house in order, that we 
return to the days of a balanced budget, that we restore fiscal 
discipline to our national government, because it is about priorities.

Many of America's priorities, honoring our soldiers, giving them the 
resources they need to get the job done, honoring our veterans and 
providing them the services that they were promised and so desperately 
need, especially with this new generation of veterans coming back from 
Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the world, the priorities in 
education, and so many other areas that are going unmet, half a billion 
dollars a day is not going to those priorities, they are going to 
simply pay interest on the debt we already got before it increases 
another $1 billion just about every single day.

We want to do something about this. We want to effect change. We are 
sick


and tired of all of the partisan bickering that goes on in our Nation's 
capital. As members of the Blue Dog Coalition we don't care whether it 
is a Democrat or Republican idea. We ask ourselves if it is a 
commonsense idea and does it make sense to the people who sent us here 
to be their voice.

We have pushed, for 6 years we have asked the Republican leadership 
to reinstitute the PAYGO rules on the floor of this House, and for 6 
years they turned a deaf ear to us. We are really proud that this new 
leadership, the Democratic leadership, has listened to the Blue Dog 
Coalition. In the first 24 hours of the 110th session of Congress, we 
saw the new Democratic leadership on this floor institute rules that 
reinstated PAYGO, which is the first step in returning to a balanced 
budget and putting an end to deficit spending.

This evening, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be joined by a former 
cochair of the Blue Dog coalition, a real leader within our group from 
the State of California (Mr. Cardoza). At this time I yield to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza).
