Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in 
supporting H.R. 2276, which names a postal facility in Vassar, 
Michigan, after Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson.

H.R. 2276, which was introduced by Representative Kildee of Michigan 
on May 10, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 
20, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire 
Michigan congressional delegation.

Madam Speaker, Marine Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson was killed on 
December 28, 2006, while conducting combat operations in al Anbar 
Province, Iraq. He was assigned to 1st Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment, 
4th Marine Division, Lansing, Michigan.

In October of 2002, Corporal Esckelson joined the U.S. Marine Corps 
Reserve and attended Delta College. His desire was to become a doctor, 
but he was called to active duty in April 2006. Corporal Esckelson was 
extremely proud to be a marine and committed to serve his country with 
distinction and courage.

Madam Speaker, I commend Representative Kildee for introducing this 
legislation and urge swift passage of this bill.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
