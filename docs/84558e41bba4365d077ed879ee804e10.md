Mr. INSLEE. I wish to address the security of our citizens. Here's a 
headline July 26 that we're going to see repeated across the country in 
the next year: ''Linwood Cops Face Job Cuts.'' We are facing a 25 
percent reduction of police officers in Linwood, Washington, because we 
can't pay for them, our first line of security in our neighborhoods. 
But today we would be voting for something on the order of over several 
years of about $4 billion to train police officers in Kabul, 
Afghanistan.

It is wrong to be borrowing money from China, laying off American 
police officers, to train police officers in Afghanistan. And it is 
wrong because it isn't showing respect for the few families that are 
fighting this war, our troops and their families, while the rest of us 
go to the beach and not be fiscally responsible for this war.

If we're going to fight this war, we should pay for it. And we should 
pay for it in a way that keeps our cops on the beat, our first line of 
security.
