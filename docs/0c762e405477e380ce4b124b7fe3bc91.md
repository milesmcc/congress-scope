Mr. STEVENS. I am also informed that the aircraft, air carriers, and 
air charter providers being used to provide the charters for our 
contractors in Iraq are, in some cases, using poorly trained crews to 
fly outdated and poorly maintained aircraft. The Senate Armed Services 
Committee will most likely address this matter during their 
consideration of the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill. We 
should consider requiring that air charter operates in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, funded either directly or indirectly by congressional 
appropriations, meet safety and maintenance standards equal to those 
required by charters in the U.S.and European Union.
