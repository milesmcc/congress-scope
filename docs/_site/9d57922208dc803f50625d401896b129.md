Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart to honor the 
memory of Army PFC Andrew Hand, one of South Alabama's finest, who 
recently lost his life while defending his country in war-torn 
Afghanistan.

On July 24, PFC Andrew Hand, age 25 of Enterprise, Alabama, gave his 
life in service to America. He and three of his comrades were killed 
when their military vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive 
device in Qalat, Afghanistan.

A member of the 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, 17th 
Fires Brigade, Private First Class Hand was serving his third 
deployment and preparing to return home in October when he was taken in 
the IED attack. He was a devoted soldier, father and son--loved by many 
and whose memory will never be forgotten.

A former resident of Birmingham, Andrew Hand moved to Enterprise with 
his family in 2001, where he was a star athlete on the Enterprise High 
School ''Wildcat'' football team. The Southeast Sun newspaper in 
Enterprise recognized him as the leading receiver and kick returner for 
the Wildcats. The paper quoted Wildcat coach Kevin Collins as saying 
Hand ''single-handedly'' beat rival Northview High School of Dothan.

PFC Andrew Hand was laid to rest on August 2, 2010 at the Alabama 
National Cemetery in Montevallo.

On behalf of the people of Alabama I wish to offer heartfelt 
condolences to the family of PFC Andrew Hand, including his wife, 
Amanda Kay Hand of Enterprise; two sons, Tristan and Gavin of 
Enterprise; mother, Phyllis Parris of Gulf Shores; father Kenneth Hand 
and stepmother Renne Hand of Birmingham; sister, Laura; and brother 
Robert, both of Birmingham.

You are all in our prayers.
