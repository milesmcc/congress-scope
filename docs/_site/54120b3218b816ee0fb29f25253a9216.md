Mr. REGULA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a hero from 
my district, Staff Sgt. Matthew Kuglics. Matthew was one of two airmen 
who died in Kirkuk, Iraq when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. 
He had just celebrated his 25th birthday. I ask the House of 
Representatives to honor this courageous young man who died in service 
to his country. Matthew grew up in North Canton and graduated from 
Green High School where he played soccer. His family, friends and loved 
ones fondly recall his sense of humor and contagious smile. After 
graduation he joined the Air Force and was stationed at Lackland Air 
Force Base and was on his second tour of Iraq as an agent within the 
Air Force Office of Special Investigations.

I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to his mother and father, 
Donna and Les Kuglics, his sister Emily and all of his family and 
friends who mourn the loss of this incredible young man. The day they 
had to say farewell to Matthew was probably the hardest day the family 
has faced and my thoughts and prayers go out to them. Matthew was laid 
to rest on Wednesday, June 13, 2007. I thank Matthew for the sacrifice 
he made by answering the call to fight for our freedom and security.
