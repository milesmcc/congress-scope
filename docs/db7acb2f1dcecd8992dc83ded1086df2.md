`Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey â€” 31 July 2008`

Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I often come to the floor, 
and I often preface my remarks when I have an amendment, saying that I 
come to the floor tonight with a commonsense amendment. Quite candidly, 
I think that is more than apropos when I speak about what I'm here to 
speak about tonight.

My amendment simply does this: It seeks to increase the funds for 
State veterans homes, and it does so in the amount of $18 million. From 
where does it get the money? Well, it does so by reducing the 
administrative expenses by a mere less than 1 percent, and that's a 
critical number, less than 1 percent. We believe that within that over 
billion dollar line that there is more than enough aptitude for going 
in and for finding less than 1 percent of additional funds that we 
could take out and put to a worthy cause such as toward our State 
veterans homes.

Today, there are 126 State extended care facilities. They're extended 
across all 50 States and in Puerto Rico as well. These veterans homes 
care for nearly 30,000 of our Nation's heroes. The number of veterans 
requiring care will continue to increase as servicemembers return from 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

Currently, there is a backlog, a huge, extensive backlog of projects 
waiting for funds. Now, many of these projects on this waiting list are 
critical for providing veterans with a healthy and secure environment. 
In fact, of the almost 200 projects waiting for Federal funds, nearly 
half of them are classified as priority 1.



I believe it is our duty to see that these facilities are able to 
provide the highest quality of care for the lives of those who have 
made the sacrifices for our Nation. After all, you can't really just 
call these things ''institutions'' anymore. These really are the homes 
where our veterans will spend out the days of their lives.

The staffs of these homes work hard to honor our veterans and to 
ensure that their last years are spent in comfort. I've had the 
pleasure now of working with folks back at the Paramus Veterans Home in 
my district in Bergen County, New Jersey. I've frequently visited with 
them and with their relatives who would come and visit, and local 
veterans organizations around the area would also come in, and they 
would work with them. These service organizations have worked hard to 
raise matching funds for these types of essential projects at these 
facilities. Likewise, they do across the Nation and, I'm sure, in each 
of your districts as well.

I would also like to make one other point. That is, in the Senate 
bill, in the Senate MilCon-VA Appropriations bill, they designate 
$1.779 billion for general operating expenses while the House version 
designates $1.801 billion. So we appropriate a little bit more than the 
Senate does. So that 1 percent cut from the appropriations line for the 
general operating expenses would still leave more money in the final 
version of the bill than the Senate version currently has. We know we 
have different numbers here so that, when it gets to conference, those 
numbers have to come into an equilibrium of some sense. We're up here. 
The Senate is over here. This will bring us closer to that equilibrium.

In addition, our colleagues over on the Senate Appropriations 
Committee have approved $250 million for the State veterans homes while 
the House budget only puts in $165 million. So my amendment would 
simply reduce this discrepancy by increasing the funding for State 
veterans homes by $18 million. In other words, we're in the House at 
$165 million. The Senate is at $250 million. We're just trying to bring 
the House number up a little bit closer to where the Senate is, which 
probably will happen once it gets into conference committee, because 
those numbers have to work together.

So I'm just suggesting that a tiny, less than 1 percent cut in the 
administrative operations would allow us to provide our country's 
heroes with a better quality of life, and I think that's what we owe 
all of them. I hope that we can find a way to work together across the 
aisle to honor our vets and to make sure that they receive excellent 
care in all of their facilities.

I yield back the balance of my time.
