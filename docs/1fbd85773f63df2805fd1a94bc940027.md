Mr. DONNELLY. I know we are starting to run short on time, so I just 
want to sum up what I have been thinking and saying here tonight with 
this: How far have we gone askew? How confused have we become with this 
administration when a 3.5 percent pay raise is unnecessary, but we lose 
$12 billion in Iraq that there is no trace of, that was loaded onto 
skids into an airplane and can't even be found. But we can't give a 3.5 
percent pay raise to the best, the bravest, the finest who have ever 
served this country.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ross, that's part of the reason we need this Iraq 
War Accountability Act, just one of the many glaring things, but I 
leave that with the American people and let them know these Blue Dogs 
are on the hunt to get that fixed.
