`Mr. MURPHY of New York â€” 22 September 2009`

Mr. MURPHY of New York. I rise today with the very sad duty of 
reporting the tragic passing of Army Private First Class Jeremiah J. 
Monroe. PFC Monroe was taken from us on September 17, 2009, by a 
roadside bomb in Afghanistan, just 2 months after his deployment.

Private First Class Monroe was assigned to the 630th Route Clearance 
Company, 7th Engineer Battalion, 10th Mountain Division, based in Fort 
Drum, New York. A beloved father, brother, son, friend, and soldier 
from Warren County, Jeremiah, will be sorely missed by the entire 
Adirondack and Fort Drum communities.



Jeremiah Monroe was just 31 years old. He quit his job last year as a 
tradesman to enlist in the Army. He wanted to support his daughter and 
the extended family and serve the Nation he loved and the ideals for 
which he gave the ultimate sacrifice.

Private First Class Monroe was willing to give his life in service to 
all of us and to the country that he loved. The expression of our 
gratitude for his sacrifice to our Nation is beyond words.

Jeremiah is survived by his mother, Dolores Monroe; his brother, 
Robert Monroe, Jr.; his 9-year-old daughter, Delilah Rose; and her 
mother, Michelle. On behalf of a grateful Nation, our thoughts and 
prayers are with the entire Monroe family, who lost four relatives in 
the last 18 months, including Jeremiah's father, Robert Monroe, Sr.
