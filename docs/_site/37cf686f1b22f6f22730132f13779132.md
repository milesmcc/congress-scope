Mr. PAUL. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit more about our policy 
because, as I said before, I think it is the policy that gets us into 
these predicaments and that, if you deal with this as a strictly 
technical/tactical problem that we have to face in how to rectify our 
problems, I don't think it will occur. I think we have to deal in the 
overall policy.

In many ways, we follow a schizophrenic type of foreign policy 
because, one time, they are our best friends, then later on they become 
our worst enemies. This was true with Saddam Hussein. In the 1980s, he 
was our friend. We took care of him. We encouraged him and supported 
his war. Then of course that changed. Even right before 9/11, the 
Taliban were still receiving money from us, and now they receive money 
from us indirectly. The Taliban gets money from the Pakistanis, or at 
least information as has been reported, but they literally get some of 
our money in the process because, in order for us to move equipment 
through Afghanistan, they literally end up getting American dollars 
from doing this.

So here we are going into Pakistan. One of the arguments to go into 
Pakistan is that we have to go after the Taliban--that they are over 
there, that they are organizing and that they want to kill the American 
soldiers in Afghanistan. This means that now they are our archenemies. 
Yet the Taliban, especially in the 1980s, weren't called the Taliban; 
they were called the Mujahedeen. It was a precursor, but they were our 
best friends along with Osama bin Laden. We were allies with them 
because we supported the principle that it was wrong for the Soviets to 
be occupying Afghanistan.

Now the tables have turned. Now we are the occupiers. Now the very 
people who used to help us are shooting and killing us. It has been 
revealed just recently with this release of information that they 
actually have some Stinger missiles, and as of the last month or so, 
three of our helicopters have been shot down.



So where does this all end?

One thing about the reports in the newspaper, I think if they changed 
the definition or the use of one term, I think it would change 
everybody's attitude, if people came around to believing that the 
Taliban are people who aren't dedicated toward coming over here to kill 
us, like some of the al Qaeda are, but the Taliban are only interested 
in getting rid of the occupiers of their country.

So we call them militant. So we go in, and we raid and shoot and kill 
and bomb, and then we say, aha, we killed 37 militants today.

What if we reported this always like we did in the eighties.
