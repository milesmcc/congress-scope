Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. I thank the gentleman, the distinguished chairman 
of our Committee on Foreign Affairs, for allowing me to say a few words 
concerning the proposed resolution.

Madam Speaker, despite my reservations about our strategy in 
Afghanistan, I do want to say that I have the utmost respect for the 
gentleman from Ohio for bringing this resolution forward for the 
purpose of having a public debate among our colleagues.

I also want to say that I associate myself with the remarks made 
earlier by my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) in asking, Why not, 
why not debate the issue? We should not deprive ourselves of 
understanding a little more about the situation that we face right now 
in Afghanistan.

Madam Speaker, after 8 long years in that country for the United 
States and after 30 years for the Afghan people, I remain skeptical 
that adding 30,000 U.S. troops and that focusing more on local and 
provincial levels of government will bring lasting stability and 
success in Afghanistan. I do, of course, want our new strategy to 
succeed, and I know that our military and civilian personnel on the 
ground will give it a supreme effort. They represent the very best this 
country has to offer.

Yet Afghanistan's history is replete with the failures of outside 
powers, or countries, in their attempting to take over or to remake the 
Afghan people--from Alexander the Great, to Genghis Khan, to the United 
Kingdom, to the Soviet Union, and now even to us.

It is my understanding that by adding 30,000 additional troops to the 
68,000 troops that we now have on the ground in Afghanistan, we are 
adding approximately 100,000 additional troops, with NATO forces, to go 
after some 27,000 Taliban and a couple of hundred al Qaeda.

By the way, I wanted to ask, Was it the Taliban or the al Qaeda 
people who attacked us on 9/11? I believe it was al Qaeda, and 15 of 
the 19 terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 were Saudi Arabs. It's 
interesting to note that.

Another thing is that, indeed, most objective observers believe it 
will take a commitment of years, perhaps even decades, by our troops 
and that it will take hundreds of billions of dollars by our taxpayers 
for Afghanistan to overcome its divisions and to develop and to 
maintain a stable, functional government.

When I weigh the likely costs in terms of lives and resources against 
the potential benefits for U.S. security, I am left wondering whether 
we are, in fact, on the right track.

As I am not a genius when it comes to military strategy, here is 
something that I am trying to figure out: the Taliban are Pashtuns, and 
12 million Pashtuns live in Afghanistan. They make up almost 50 percent 
of Afghanistan's population. President Karzai is even a Pashtun. There 
are an additional 27 million Pashtuns who live on the other side of the 
border, right on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
