Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, our country has just begun the fifth year of 
war in Iraq. By overwhelming numbers, the American people want a new 
direction and I believe this bill contains the policy and the plan to 
help bring an end to the misguided policies of the Administration.

Military leaders, Generals Abizaid, Odom and Powell, as well as 
former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, have all come 
forward to observe that the Administration's war-without-end policy is 
not a strategy for success.

Today's legislation directs itself to important change. It sets a new 
course for ending the war.

The bill requires accountability: It puts the Iraqis in charge of 
Iraq. If they cannot or will not bring their country under control, if 
conditions continue to worsen and political and military benchmarks are 
not met, beginning in July 2007 (less than four months from today), our 
troops will begin an immediate redeployment.

The bill begins a redeployment: It sets a firm timeline to pull U.S. 
troops out of Iraq and in legally-binding terms declares that all U.S. 
troops will be out of Iraq by August 31, 2008, if not sooner.

It requires the Iraqis--not our soldiers--to reign in the militias, 
aggressively pursue the insurgents and provide ''evenhanded security 
for all Iraqis.''

The bill prohibits the establishment of any permanent military bases. 
It bans the use of torture. It redirects resources back to the fight 
against terrorism and Al-Qaeda, and recommits us to creating a stable 
state in Afghanistan.

The bill takes care of our troops. It provides over $3 billion more 
than the President's request to meet the neglected needs of our 
returning soldiers and veterans around the country.

The following are quotes from respected national leaders:

Retired General William Odom, former Director of the National 
Security Agency under President Reagan and member of the National 
Security Council under President Carter stated recently: ''Getting out 
of Iraq is the pre-condition for creating new strategic options.''

According to former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski:

''The United States cannot afford an open-ended commitment to a war 
without end. A means must be devised to end the U.S. combat role in 
Iraq and reduce our troop levels, so that we can begin to rebuild our 
military and reclaim our position of leadership in the world. The bill 
the House will consider this week does that in an effective and 
responsible way.''

Former NATO Commander Wesley Clark:



''The conflict must be resolved politically--military efforts alone 
are insufficient--and this legislation strongly promotes that political 
solution.''

Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this supplemental legislation. For the 
first time the debate about Iraq is not ''if' or ''how.'' It is about 
''when'' . . . when our troops will come home.

It is binding language.

It is sensible language.

It is language that will change the direction of the war.

It is language that will help to heal our wounded troops.

It is language that will help heal our Nation.

I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
