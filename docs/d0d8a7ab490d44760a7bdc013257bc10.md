Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize SFC Greg Hubby, 
a native of Boone, Iowa, as a recipient of a Bronze Star Medal for 
heroic achievement during combat operations in support of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. The Bronze Star is the fourth highest award that the 
Department of Defense gives for bravery, heroism, and meritorious 
service.

SFC Hubby earned the Bronze Star while he was a retention NCO with 
the 3rd Infantry Battalion, stationed in Mosul. During one of his 
helicopter trips to another outpost, their helicopter came under fire.

SFC Hubby's bravery goes above and beyond what we are asked of as 
citizens of this country. Although recruiters are typically non-
deployable, SPC Hubby reached out to share in the sacrifices of our 
other brave men and women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan by 
volunteering his service at a time of need. His heroism illustrates the 
compassion of Iowans; willing to risk their own lives for their 
country. For this I offer him my utmost congratulations and thanks for 
his service and sacrifice for this great nation.

I commend SFC Greg Hubby's courageousness and service, and I am 
honored to represent him in the United States Congress. I know my 
colleagues join me in recognizing his service and wishing him and his 
family the very best in their future endeavors.
