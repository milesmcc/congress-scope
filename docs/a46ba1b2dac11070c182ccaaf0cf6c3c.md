`Mr. HOYER â€” 6 May 2010`

Mr. HOYER. We are still working on the budget. I will hopefully bring 
that forward when it is ready, obviously when the Budget Committee 
considers it. As it relates to the Afghan-Pakistan supplemental, the 
President requested, as you know, approximately $33 billion in his 
budget at the beginning of the year. The Defense Department says that 
the money that they have will be depleted sometime this summer. It's 
important, obviously, therefore, that we move soon. And I hope to do 
that.

I would hope that when we move this bill forward that we will see 
bipartisan support for it, obviously to support our troops in harm's 
way, carrying out a policy that I know, as the gentleman has observed 
before, the Republican whip himself and others have indicated their 
support of the President's policy in Afghanistan. This money for 
Afghanistan and Pakistan will fund those efforts. And I am hopeful when 
we do bring it forward that we will have bipartisan support for that 
piece of legislation.
