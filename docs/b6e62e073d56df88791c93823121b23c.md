# JUBILEE ACT FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND EXPANDED DEBT CANCELLATION OF

`Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts â€” 16 April 2008`

Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No. The answer is, of course, one that 
leads me to suggest that the answer really is ''yes.'' When people 
dance around and won't give you the answer, Madam Speaker, the answer 
is ''yes.''

Apparently, under the criteria set forward here, while Iraq is not 
now on the list for relief, it could not get it in the future. We will 
be setting policy that would have screwed you up because apparently, as 
this is defined, I infer that the Government of Iraq is covered because 
if the Government of Iraq wasn't covered by this, the answer would be 
''no.'' When I don't get ''no,'' but when I get a discussion of nuclear 
weapons and what's currently in the bill and I don't get an answer to 
the question, then it is clear to me.

So Members, I guess, are free to vote on this.
