# LEGISLATIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007
## `9f237fcaa24337355a969f8959965c45`
`Mr. COBURN â€” 11 January 2007`

Mr. COBURN. The question I have is, The distinguished Senator from 
West Virginia asked the question: How long and at what price? But that 
is a false choice. Because if we leave Iraq and we walk away, we are 
going to be fighting this battle again. So it is not about how long and 
at what price; it is, when are we going to have this battle again? I 
believe that is up for debate. What the American people lack is the 
understanding that if we walk out now, we are going to put young men 
and women


again at risk, at far greater numbers and at far greater cost in the 
future, as we empower the terrorists. I wonder if the Senator from 
Arizona may comment.
