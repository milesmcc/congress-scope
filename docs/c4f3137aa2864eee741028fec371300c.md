Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I support his 
amendment.

As many of us on the Armed Services Committee have traveled to Iraq a 
number of times, and we utilize right now bases throughout Iraq, like 
the Balad Air Base, which was previously a fighter air base for Saddam 
Hussein's tactical aircraft, we use those bases, it makes absolute 
sense that we shouldn't somehow put Iraq in a different category than 
every other ally of the world which allows us to have a basing in their 
country. So designating that we may have temporary basing in Iraq is 
absolutely normal relations with Iraq, something that we have with 
dozens and dozens of other nations; and that will allow us in times of 
exigency to be able to use runways for resupply, for tactical air 
operations, for other


operations that extend important American foreign policy in that region 
of the world.

And so I think the gentleman has a very commonsense amendment, and I 
would support it.
