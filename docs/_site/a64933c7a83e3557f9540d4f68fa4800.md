Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a brave soldier, a dedicated citizen of Thomasville, Georgia, and a 
great American, U.S. Army Specialist Shannon ''Chanen'' Chihuahua, who 
selflessly gave his life while serving his country in Operation 
Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Specialist Chihuahua was born in 1985, and was raised in Thomasville, 
Georgia. After graduating from Thomas County Central High School in 
2004, he attended Valdosta State University. He met his loving wife, 
Kristen, in July of 2006 and the two were married November 4, 2006.

Answering the call to service, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. 
Specialist Chihuahua was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry 
Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air 
Assault), at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

His awards and decorations include: Purple Heart; Army Commendation 
Medal; Army Achievement Medal; National Defense Service Medal; 
Afghanistan Campaign Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; Army 
Service Ribbon; NATO Medal; and Combat Medic Badge.

While deployed to Afghanistan, he was one of several service members 
tragically killed on November 12, 2010 when insurgents attacked his 
unit using small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades. He gave the 
ultimate sacrifice; he died while trying to save a fellow soldier, who 
was injured.

Specialist Chihuahua's death is a great loss to this country, as he 
was a man of great promise and honor. He was described as an energetic 
and positive person with a constant smile. He was well regarded by his 
peers and known for his congeniality.



His death is also a great loss to his loving family. He is survived 
by his wife, Kristen; two daughters, Sophia and Annabelle; his mother, 
Dennice Dinkins of Thomasville, Georgia; and father, Sebastian 
Chihuahua of Del Rio, Texas.

Madam Speaker, U.S. Army Specialist Shannon ''Chanen'' Chihuahua made 
the ultimate sacrifice for his country. His time on this earth was too 
short. He was a proud American, a brave soldier, and a true family man. 
In life, he was loved and honored and in death, he will be remembered 
by a grateful nation.
