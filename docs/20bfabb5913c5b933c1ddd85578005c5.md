Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, as a nation, we face challenges 
ranging from education shortfalls and growing energy needs to a slowly 
recovering job market. We cannot afford to escalate the Afghan war with 
a credit card. The mounting loss of life and widespread corruption 
gives no indication that more money and more boots on the ground will 
achieve success in Afghanistan.

We need success at home. The elements in the bill for veterans 
exposed to Agent Orange and for FEMA are a start. I cannot support a 
bill that spends $37 billion in Afghanistan while denying $10 billion 
for teacher jobs, $1 billion for summer youth employment, $5 billion 
for Pell grants, and $701 million for border security. My votes signal 
in the strongest possible terms that this war must be wound down and 
not escalated.

Across Oregon, our priorities are helping small businesses, creating 
jobs, and supporting our schools.

We need to start making the right choices. This means drawing down 
from a costly war that Americans and Afghans want to end, and investing 
in a better, more productive future for our country.
