`Mr. FEINGOLD â€” 1 October 2007`

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted against the fiscal year 2008 
defense authorization bill because it does nothing to bring to a close 
the open-ended military mission in Iraq, which has overburdened our 
military, weakened our national security, and cost the lives of 
thousands of American soldiers.

There were provisions in the bill which I strongly supported, 
including language I proposed that will make it easier for family 
members and other trusted adults to take leave to care for children and 
dependents when their loved ones are deployed. I am also pleased that 
the Senate approved two amendments I cosponsored. One was an amendment 
by Senator Webb creating a Commission on Wartime Contracting to examine 
waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the misuse of 
force by private security contractors. The other was an amendment by 
Senator Sanders to ensure that money allocated for research on gulf war 
illnesses is spent wisely.

But on balance, I could not vote for a bill that defies the will of 
so many Wisconsinites and so many Americans by allowing the President 
to continue one of the greatest and most tragic foreign policy blunders 
in the history of our Nation.
