`Mr. HATCH â€” 11 February 2008`

---


Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments to eulogize 
our old friend, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Tom Lantos. He has been one of my dear friends all these years. I have 
been here 31 years, and he was here 26 years. He and Annette have 
really been wonderful people in Elaine's and my life.

Mr. President, this morning began sadly, as the two leaders have 
said, with the news of the death of Congressman Tom Lantos, one of the 
giants among the Democrats in the House, and, frankly, among all 
Members of Congress during the last 28 years. Congressman Lantos had 
been diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, and had recently announced 
he would not run for a 14th term for the 12th District of California, 
which he so ably served since 1980.

Tom Lantos led a remarkable life. A Hungarian Jew, he lived what he 
said was a happy childhood until the Hungarian fascist allies of Hitler 
brought the Holocaust to Hungary. Through most of the war, he was 
interned in various forced labor camps, some from which he escaped, and 
was at least once recaptured, following a beating that he later said, 
''I was pleasantly surprised to survive.''

After a final escape, he spent the remainder of the war in hiding, 
protected, as so many Hungarian Jews were, by Raoul Wallenberg, the man 
who risked his life to protect as many of Hungary's Jews as he could 
and who vanished into the Soviet camps at the end of the war. One of 
the great days of my life was to pay homage to Raoul Wallenberg at the 
monument in Europe.

Six hundred thousand Hungarian Jews perished in the Holocaust, 
including Tom Lantos's family. One of the first initiatives of 
Congressman Lantos upon coming to the House of Representatives in 1980 
was to pass legislation granting Raoul Wallenberg U.S. citizenship.

Tom Lantos was, in his words, ''an American by choice,'' and to know 
him was to see that every day of his life he embraced the opportunities 
an immigrant can find in this great country. He arrived penniless to 
this country, as my two colleagues have said. According to his 
biography, his only possession was ''a precious Hungarian salami,'' 
which was confiscated upon arrival, as my colleagues mentioned. But 
with a scholarship and hard work, he earned a Ph.D. in economics and


taught at San Francisco's State University for almost three decades, 
developing, during that time, his credentials as a commentator on world 
affairs.

Tom Lantos brought to the House his passionate patriotism and the 
drive of a survivor. When people would comment on the demands of his 
work, which included regular travel to his constituency 3,000 miles 
away, his global travels as a Member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, which he recently chaired, and the hectic pace of his other 
congressional assignments, he would be quick to remind us that this was 
nothing in comparison to what he had faced as a young man.

He founded the House Human Rights Caucus, a platform which he used to 
highlight the human rights abuses around the world, and with which he 
became inextricably associated. For many of us in Congress and for many 
oppressed through the world, Congressman Lantos was the chairman for 
human rights.

He was a Democrat who believed in the use of American power for good 
and who understood the nuances of subtle, as well as confrontational, 
diplomacy.

For example, he kept trying to get a visa to visit Tehran because he 
believed there was always room to talk with enemies as well as friends. 
But when asked what he would say to the dictators in Tehran, he was 
less than subtle:




 I will tell the Iranians the truth--that it's a great 


 country and they need to be reintegrated into the family of 


 civilized nations and that they must give up their lunatic 


 notions.


Less than subtle, to be sure, but truthful. It is hard to disagree 
with this view, Mr. President.

Tom Lantos also recognized that diplomacy could fail and the use of 
the U.S. military could achieve noble ends. He was a strong supporter 
of the military during the Cold War, supported military assistance to 
Israel, urged President Clinton to lead NATO forces against Milosevic's 
genocide, and supported our interventions in Iraq, although, to be fair 
to him, he was critical, as many of us have been, about the 
implementation of our invasion of Iraq.

The point is, Tom Lantos represented the wing of the Democratic Party 
that kept central our national security concerns, that recognized our 
duty in the world, and accepted that the use of force is sometimes 
required. This is the wing of the Democratic Party that needs to 
survive if that party is to remain relevant to the events in the world 
that will continually shape us.

I am honored to have been a friend of Tom Lantos for decades. We 
loved each other. We showed that love repeatedly over the years. He was 
a dear friend, and I want everybody to know just how deeply I felt 
about him. Our staffs worked together well, and he always had my 
admiration and respect.

I will never forget a tour he gave me and Senators Reid and Daschle 
of the old Jewish ghetto in Budapest when our separate codels happened 
to be in that city at the same time in 1996. Later, he gave us a 
personal tour of the magnificent Hungarian Parliament building. One of 
the first post-Communist governments was in power, and they so highly 
regarded Tom Lantos for his heritage, as well as his anti-Communist 
stance throughout his life, that he was granted free access throughout 
the building. He even knew where to turn the lights on.

The prayers and thoughts of Elaine and I go out to Annette, his 
beautiful wife of 58 years, whom he married in California, but who, 
like himself, was a survivor of the Holocaust in Hungary and was 
actually a childhood sweetheart. The fact that they loved each other as 
long as they have, that they came from similar backgrounds, and worked 
together daily throughout their lives only makes her loss that much 
sadder.

Our condolences go out to her and their two wonderful children. And I 
believe there are 18 grandchildren. But the death of Tom Lantos is a 
great loss, as well, to his constituents, to his colleagues in the 
House, to his party, and to all of us in Congress. It is a loss to our 
great Nation and to all those who strive in solidarity for the cause of 
human rights.

Tom Lantos was slight of build, but he was a giant. He was a moral 
force who used the authority of a survivor from the Holocaust, of an 
American immigrant, and of a scholar and leader to show the great 
institution of Congress how it can lead in a dangerous and often 
immoral world.

Elaine and I loved Tom, we love Annette, and we hope we can be of 
some assistance to Annette and her family as we move into the future. 
But we will miss Tom very badly. What a great and noble man who 
suffered so much for freedom.

I thank the Chair.
