Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Chairman, I rise on behalf of Mr. Klein of Florida 
and myself to offer an amendment to the fiscal year 2009 National 
Defense Authorization Act, requiring Iraq to help support our troops 
stationed in their country.

Oil revenues have helped generate a multibillion-dollar surplus in 
Iraq that is expected to reach $180 billion within 3 years. Still, 
American taxpayers send $339 million to Iraq each day, money that can 
be invested here, as gas prices are soaring, education is lagging, 
health care is increasingly out of reach, and everywhere American 
families are struggling.

When the administration negotiates a Status of Forces Agreement this 
year, this amendment will require them to negotiate commonsense terms 
for Iraq to provide support for our military operations on their soil. 
This arrangement could be similar to the plan we have with South Korea, 
where they pay our security costs, or in Japan, which pays for 75 
percent of the cost of maintaining troops and grants U.S. base rights.

Whatever the arrangement, this amendment would ensure that Americans 
no longer have to shoulder the burden alone. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this amendment.
