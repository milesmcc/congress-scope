Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio.

Mr. Chairman, I don't think of ourselves as a ''cast.'' I think of 
ourselves as the people that we were sent here to be, representatives 
of the hardworking people of the United States and of our districts.

I think that particularly those of us in the Republican Party, most 
of us have led lives that keep us in touch with our constituents. We 
haven't spent a lifetime in Washington. We haven't advocated for being 
in Washington 5 days a week, out of touch with the American public.

There are a couple of things that have been said that I think have to 
be responded to today. They haven't been responded to properly in the 
last few weeks, I don't think.

One is the Clinton-squandered surplus. Let me remind the majority 
party that the reason we had a surplus during the third and fourth 
years of the Clinton administration was because there was a fiscally 
responsible Republican majority in the Congress. You cannot attribute 
the surplus to a President who has no control except to veto.

I want to say something about the waste of money on the war in Iraq. 
Were we not supporting those brave men and women who are currently 
serving not just in Iraq, but all over the world keeping us free, we 
wouldn't have the right to come to this floor and say the things that 
we say. The Federal Government was formed for the defense of this 
Nation. That is where money should be spent so we can maintain our 
freedom.

Nobody wants to be at war. I don't want to be at war. The President, 
I don't believe, wants to be at war. But we are at war because we were 
attacked. Those people have said repeatedly they want to destroy us; 
they want to destroy our way of life. We need to spend what we have to 
spend to keep our freedom. We don't have to raise these budgets by 10 
percent to keep doing what we need to do for the American people.
