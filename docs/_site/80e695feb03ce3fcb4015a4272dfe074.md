Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I come before you today to offer a 
resolution that honors a group of fine Americans, the Patriot Guard 
Riders. Established in November of 2005, the Patriot Guard Riders were 
created to counter protesters of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who 
sought to disrupt the funerals of our heroes who died serving our 
country. Today, the


Patriot Guard Riders are over 190,000 members strong and they dedicate 
themselves to a mission of preventing interruptions at funerals 
honoring those servicemen and women who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice protecting our nation.

To date, the Patriot Guard Riders have participated in over 17,000 
missions honoring our heroes around the country. They have also 
distinguished themselves in countless other ways, to include the 
establishment of the Fallen Warrior Scholarship Fund for U.S. military 
family members, visiting veteran's hospitals, and giving financial 
assistance to the families of our fallen heroes.

Madam Speaker, as we approach this Independence Day, it is 
appropriate to recognize these great Americans who have dedicated 
themselves to protecting the solemnity of the final farewells of those 
who died while serving to preserve the liberties that we exercise here 
in this House today. It is the actions of patriots like these, those 
who readily stand to support our fallen heroes, that help make this 
nation great.
