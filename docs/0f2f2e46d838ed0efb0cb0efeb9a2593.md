# IRAQI SURRENDER GROUP

Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, now that the media sideshows and the press 
conferences are over for the Iraqi Surrender Group, and the President 
vetoed the day of surrender bill yesterday, and properly so, Congress 
needs to get on about the business of funding our troops. Failure to 
fund our troops not only will affect our troops there, but it will 
affect the Iraqi security forces, the National Guard, and, of course, 
our Reserves.

That first bill may have funded some of the troops, but it had the 
pork and beans provision, $26 billion for the shrimp industry, the 
peanut farmers and the spinach farmers. Eliminate that and eliminate 
the day of surrender provision in that bill. Have a clean bill to 
support our troops. No more complaining. Send them the money they need.

This reminds me of the same problem that General Stonewall Jackson 
had with the Confederate Congress when they were complaining about the 
war. He said, ''Send more troops, not more questions.''

And that's just the way it is.
