Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, last week the administration announced plans 
for veterans to rely on private insurance company payments for the 
treatment of their war wounds. The American Legion's Commander Rehbein 
and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Executive Director 
Reickhoff have already expressed very strong concerns.

The government broke these soldiers in battles across World War II, 
Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. We, the citizens of America, owe 
veterans care through our government. Veterans should not depend on 
private insurance companies who bear no moral bond to soldiers or their 
pain.

One of President Washington's first missions was to care for 
veterans. President Lincoln promised ''to care for him who bore the 
brunt of battle, his widow and his orphan.''

President Obama eloquently portrays Lincoln as his hero, and it is 
clear what Lincoln would advise today.

Care for our veterans, Mr. President. Private companies owe them very 
little. We, the American people and our Federal Government, owe them 
everything.
