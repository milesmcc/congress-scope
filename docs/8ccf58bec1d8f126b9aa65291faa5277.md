Mr. KUCINICH. The Greatest Generation sacrificed during their 
lifetime so future generations could have it better. Here, the 
''bailout generation'' demands the future will be sacrificed for the 
present with unlimited money from Wall Street and war.

While the government expands the debt for Wall Street and war, people 
are led to believe that we're doing it for jobs on Main Street. Even 
today as Congress expands the debt limit, CitiGroup will get billions 
in new tax breaks. Last week, Congress let Wall Street keep their over-
the-counter black box derivatives game going, which will leave the 
taxpayers exposed to huge losses in the future.

Today, Congress will give the Pentagon another $550 billion and the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan another $130 billion, where we expand the 
national debt, sacrificing the future for the present. In the past 2 
years, Congress chose war and Wall Street over jobs and Main Street, 
expanding the debt, sacrificing the future for the present.

Today's job bill is necessary but will address only a fraction of the 
unemployed. Rather than prime the pump of the economy and put all of 
America back to work, we have to sacrifice the future for war and for 
Wall Street.
