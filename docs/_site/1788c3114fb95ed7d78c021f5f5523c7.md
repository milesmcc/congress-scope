Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I rise in strong support of the Franks amendment. Since last April, 
two arms shipment from Iran, including mortars, rocket-propelled 
grenades, C-4 explosives and small arms have reportedly been 
intercepted by U.S. and coalition troops.

Further, a NATO spokesman recently stated that an explosively formed 
projectile, EFP, which resembled the EFPs bearing Iranian manufacturing 
markings that have been found in Iraq, have been recently discovered in 
Kabul. This directly affects the safety and security of our men and 
women serving in Afghanistan. As I pointed out previously, my daughter-
in-law is one of those wearing our Nation's uniform serving in 
Afghanistan. We want to make sure that we protect everyone in that 
country.

These disturbing developments may indicate that the Iranian regime 
has decided to also undermine the government of Afghanistan and U.S. 
efforts to deny Islamic militants a safe haven in Afghanistan.

While fighting in Afghanistan has thus far been concentrated near the 
Pakistani border, increased Iranian interference in Afghanistan may 
indicate an attempt to provoke the U.S. and our coalition partners into 
opening a second front. Iran's apparently increasing involvement in 
this central front of the global war against radical jihadists reflects 
the goal of the regime of pursuing regional dominance, spreading 
radical Islam, and counteracting western influence in the region. Such 
a goal is intolerable. As in Iraq, failure in Afghanistan is not an 
option.

Mr. Chairman, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act works 
to bolster our efforts, and I support the Franks amendment.
