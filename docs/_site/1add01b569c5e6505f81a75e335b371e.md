`Mr. INHOFE â€” 4 February 2009`

Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, I wish to make a comment on the 
remarks of the Senator from Missouri.

One of the most disturbing things, other than the cost of this 
stimulus bill, is the fact there is nothing in there to stimulate. 
There are two things that can be done that would be of great benefit to 
the United States of America.

One is, as he talked about, infrastructure. I was somewhat shocked 
that in the bill, on the other side, there was only $30 billion, in the 
Senate bill $27 billion that would go toward highways, bridges, and 
that type of construction. I am very much in support of his amendment 
No. 161 that will raise that amount by $5.5 billion. I have to say, it 
is not enough. That would still be less than 5 percent of the total 
amount that would go to those items that would provide immediate jobs.

In my State of Oklahoma, we can identify over $1.1 billion, just in 
Oklahoma, of projects that are spade ready, with environmental impact 
statements, everything has been done. We are ready to go on them. That 
is what will produce jobs tomorrow and the next day and the next day.

The other area is in the military. While those two amendments have to 
do with the infrastructure of which I am in strong support, the Boxer-
Inhofe amendment has yet to be filed. It will be filed. We are talking 
there about some $50 billion that would go toward construction and 
infrastructure.










 Amendment No. 262 to Amendment No. 98


I want to mention, though, there is one other amendment I do want to 
bring up for consideration. That is amendment No. 262. This is a 
recognition of investing in our Nation's defense. It provides thousands 
of sustainable American jobs and provides for our Nation's security at 
the same time.

Major defense procurement programs are all manufactured in the United 
States, with our aerospace industry alone employing more than 655,000 
workers spread across the United States. At the end of last month, 
conservative economist Martin Feldstein wrote in the Washington Post 
about the $800 billion mistake. He was referring, of course, to the 
stimulus bill.

In that article, he pointed out the value of infrastructure spending 
on domestic military bases is the most significant we could do to try 
to stimulate the economy. In fact, it is clear that infrastructure 
investment alone with defense spending and tax cuts has a greater 
stimulative impact on the economy than anything else the government can 
do.

If our infrastructure needs repair, we equally need the tools to 
reconstruct our military readiness. That is what I am trying to do with 
this amendment. This is amendment No. 262.

I agree with everything that was said by the Senator from Missouri, 
that we need to do a lot of this with infrastructure. But, equally, my 
amendment increases defense procurement spending to manufacture or 
acquire vehicles, equipment, ammunition, and materials required to 
reconstitute military units.

We are accomplishing two things: We are providing the jobs; we are 
also rebuilding our military. The one thing we hear on the floor over 
and over, with the activity that is now subsiding in Iraq but, of 
course, escalating in Afghanistan, is that we are overworking everyone. 
The term we use in the military is the OPTEMPO is too high. We all 
recognize that fact.

We know we went through the decade of the nineties reducing spending 
on both end strength and modernization. What we need to do, if we are 
going to be having some kind of stimulative effect, if you can do it 
and rebuild our military, drop down the OPTEMPO for our people serving 
and at the same time do something about some of our FCS systems, for 
example, the Future Combat System, so we will become superior to our 
prospective enemies on the field in terms of equipment we give our 
kids.

Right now, we all recognize that with the exception of the F-22 and 
the Joint Strike Fighter, the Russians are making the SU series that is 
superior to our best strike vehicles, the F-15 and F-16. This is a 
procurement problem. We already have the lines going on C-17s and other 
vehicles, and it is going to be necessary to augment that.



This is fully offset. It does have $5.3 billion that would increase 
procurement.

I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment for the 
purpose of bringing up Inhofe amendment No. 262.
