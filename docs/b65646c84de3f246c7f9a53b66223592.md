`Mr. McCAIN â€” 20 September 2007`

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are about to have a vote. I again thank 
my friend from Wisconsin for the level of this debate. My only comment 
and conclusion is that I urge my colleagues to reject an amendment that 
basically returns the failed strategy we had for nearly 4 years. I keep 
hearing, as I did from the majority leader, it is time to change 
course, time to change course. Well, we did change course, thank God; 
that new course has been succeeding. Do we have a long, hard struggle 
ahead? Of course we do. After a few months of the new strategy--and I 
recognize the other challenges, such as the political one and the 
Maliki Government and the police. But I am convinced the new strategy 
can succeed and the consequences of failure, as outlined by people who 
were opponents for the war in Iraq initially--this course of action, 
going back to the old failed strategy would lead to chaos, destruction, 
deterioration, and an eventual return on the part of American military 
people with further service and sacrifice.

I again thank my friend from Wisconsin for his level of debate. I 
respect


very much his commitment to the security of this Nation.

I yield back the remainder of my time.
