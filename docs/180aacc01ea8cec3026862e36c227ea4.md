Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to honor SSN 773, the USS 
Cheyenne, for her 10 years of service in the U.S. Navy in defense of 
our freedom.

On July 6, 1992, the keel was laid for the USS Cheyenne in Newport 
News, VA. She was launched on April 16, 1995. On September 13, 1996, 
Mrs. Ann Simpson sponsored the USS Cheyenne. I am pleased to now occupy 
the seat of Ann's husband, Senator Alan Simpson, in the U.S. Senate.

Since September 11, 2001, the USS Cheyenne has been engaged in 
important missions as part of the global war on terrorism. The USS 
Cheyenne earned the distinction of the first to strike when she was the 
first ship to launch Tomahawk missiles in Operation Iraqi Freedom under 
the command of Commander Charles Doty. She would go on to successfully 
launch her entire complement of Tomahawks, earning a clean sweep for 
combat actions in the final three months of her nine month deployment. 
That level of excellence continues today from her homeport in Pearl 
Harbor, HI.

The USS Cheyenne is the last Los Angeles class submarine built and 
the third ship in our Nation's fleet named in honor of the city home to 
Wyoming's State capital. The first USS Cheyenne, a tugboat, entered 
service in 1898. The second USS Cheyenne, BM 10, was originally the 
monitor class USS Wyoming. In 1909 it was renamed USS Cheyenne to make 
the name available for the battleship BB 32, the new USS Wyoming. 
Fiction writer Tom Clancy further cemented the legend of the USS 
Cheyenne when he made the submarine a central player in a battle for 
the Spratly Islands in his novel ''SSN.''

Cheyenne, Wyoming's motto is ''Live the Legend.'' The 145 submariners 
who are aboard the USS Cheyenne have adopted the motto ''Ride the 
Legend.'' The city of Cheyenne has formed a special bond with the crew 
of her namesake. Each year the outstanding sailors of the USS Cheyenne 
are the guests of the city of Cheyenne for Cheyenne Frontier Days, the 
world's largest outdoor rodeo, and the ''Daddy of them All''. Many of 
the sailors have never been out West or been to a rodeo. For a week the 
submariners enjoy Wyoming hospitality and have a chance to live the 
legend. It is a small chance for Wyoming and the people of Cheyenne to 
repay a debt of gratitude to the crew of the USS Cheyenne.

Commander Michael Tesar assumed command of the USS Cheyenne on June 
4, 2006. I wish him well in his new command and thank Commander Richard 
Testyon Jr. for his time at the helm. Commander Tesar brings extensive 
experience to the USS Cheyenne and will lead SSN 773 well.

The best skippers are complemented by outstanding crew; I would like 
to honor the crew of the USS Cheyenne. They include EM3 Richard Akins,
