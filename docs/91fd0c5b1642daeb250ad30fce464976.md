Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the House 
recently considered and passed H.R. 7112, a bill that expands the Iran 
Sanctions Act and authorizes state and local governments to divest from 
certain companies that hold Iranian assets.

The timing of this legislation could not be more appropriate. This 
past week, the president of Iran visited the United Nations in New York 
City and gave two addresses. Not surprisingly, he took advantage of the 
platform and condemned ''a small but deceitful number of people called 
Zionists'' for using their influence in Europe and the U.S. in ''a 
deceitful, complex, and furtive manner.'' He also referred to ''Zionist 
murders'' and accused Jews of having an ''underhanded'' role in the 
crisis in Georgia.

But President Ahmadinejad didn't limit his attacks to Israelis. He 
boasted that ''the American empire. . . is reaching the end of the 
road.'' Clearly, Tehran has malicious intentions and especially detests 
the United States and Israel. That's why H.R. 7112 is critical to 
improving our national security and stability. While Iran points out 
alleged flaws in American and Israeli policy, it continues to defy the 
Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, numerous U.N. Security Council 
resolutions, and International Atomic Energy Agency inspections.

Of course, Iran claims to be enriching uranium for energy use, but 
U.N. inspectors have found elements that are constructive only in 
weapons. If Iran did indeed develop a nuclear bomb, the repercussions 
would be felt throughout the region, including in Iraq, India, 
Pakistan, Turkey, and Israel, as well as in the U.S. Since Iran is 
already supplying weapons to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and 
Hamas, it is important that we act now to prevent the sale of sensitive 
material to Tehran.

Finally, I would also like to mention another bill that recently 
passed the House: H. Res. 1361. While this Resolution rightly condemns 
the anti-Semitic language of the 2001 Durban Conference (Durban I), I 
urge my fellow Members to take the next step and support my 
legislation, H.R. 5847 or the United Nations Durban Review Conference 
(Durban II) Funding Prohibition Act.
