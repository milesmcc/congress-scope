`Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin â€” 29 April 2008`

---


Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, I was absent for legislative 
business conducted on April 24, 2008, to attend the funeral of a fallen 
soldier who lost his life in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As a 
result, I missed rollcall votes 220 through 223.

Had I been present, I would have voted:

''Aye'' on rollcall vote 220--the Poe Amendment to H.R. 2830;

''Aye'' on rollcall vote 221--the McNerny Amendment to H.R. 2830;

''Aye'' on rollcall vote 222--the Motion to Recommit H.R. 2830 with 
instructions; and

''Aye'' on rollcall vote 223--Passage of H.R. 2830.
