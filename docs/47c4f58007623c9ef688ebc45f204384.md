Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, today I have introduced 
a resolution calling on Congress to recognize and embrace the success 
we have seen on the ground in Iraq and dedicate ourselves to support 
these efforts in achieving victory.

I have visited our troops in Iraq nine times. I have seen firsthand 
the success of the surge. While meeting with General David Petraeus 
last week in Baghdad, he reported an over-60 percent reduction in 
violence, with al Qaeda on the defense in Anbar province.

The success our military men and women and people of Iraq have 
achieved is real. The best way to protect American families is to stop 
terrorists overseas. The best way to end the war is through victory. 
We, as representatives of the American people, must put aside politics 
and recognize what is at stake in Iraq. As my resolution states: 
''Congress must support the idea that the war in Iraq is not lost'' and 
that it ''will do all it can to ensure coalition victory.''

In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
