Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as cochair of the Bulgaria 
Caucus, I rise today to welcome Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev of the 
Republic of Bulgaria to Washington.

Since the defeat of communism in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria has emerged 
as a dynamic democracy. The country became a part of NATO in 2004 and 
the European Union in 2007. Recently the World Bank classified Bulgaria 
as one of the top 10 nations to have undertaken important economic 
reforms to attract business investment. Bulgaria is the only EU nation 
to be listed in the top 10.

Since my first visit as an election observer in June 1990, I have 
seen firsthand the talented people of Bulgaria emerge from 
totalitarianism to be one of the world's most vibrant nations as a free 
market democracy. Elena Poptodorova, the able ambassador from Bulgaria, 
has been vital in developing Bulgarian-American friendships.

I especially wish to thank Bulgaria for their continued support in 
the global war on terrorism. I have visited Bulgarian troops in 
Afghanistan, and my son Alan served with Bulgarians in Iraq. Our Nation 
and the world is safer and more prosperous by defeating terrorism 
overseas.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
