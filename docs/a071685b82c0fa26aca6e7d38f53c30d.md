Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, some semblance of security in 
Baghdad, but chlorine bombs in Anbar province and other parts of Iraq, 
the fourth-year anniversary of this country's offensive on the nation 
state of Iraq.

It is interesting that as we continue to watch our young people fall 
in battle, heroes that they are, and veterans come home, that the 
executive in this body, this Congress, this House and the other body 
cannot come to grips with a forward path for solving and reconciling 
the war in Iraq.

It is interesting that our Commander in Chief desires to tell us that 
we must stay the course, a refrain that we have heard over and over 
again.

My plea would be let us sit down at the table of reconciliation. Let 
us not suggest that people who stand for conscience are unpatriotic, 
and let us resolve to bring our troops home together in dignity and 
with success.
