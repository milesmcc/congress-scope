`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 15 March 2007`

---


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I look forward to the old team being back down 
here. And I just want to continue as to what we are doing to try to fix 
this problem.

As I said, with the benchmarks and making sure the Iraqi soldiers 
stand up, but a key component of this, as Ms. Wasserman Schultz has 
just mentioned is that we are saying that our troops can't leave here, 
the United States, and go to Iraq if they don't have the requisite 
level of equipment and training. And I don't think there is anybody in 
the country who would want to send one of our soldiers or lots of our 
soldiers off to war knowing, and the legal term is mense rea, you know, 
with intent, send kids that don't have the proper equipment and 
training.

And the training part is something that Ms. Wasserman Schultz was 
just talking about. We have a readiness crisis in the Army. We are not 
capable now of handling another situation, military situation.

Now, I think if you would ask the American people are we 
overstretched, they would all say yes. And if you talk to the military 
families, they say, yes, we are overstretched to the point where we 
have kids in battle who don't have everything that they need. And that 
is unacceptable. And so in our supplemental bill, we are saying that if 
you don't have the training and the equipment and the proper amount of 
rest, you are not going.

Now, we put a waiver in there so that the President could waive it if 
there is a national security interest involved. But we don't like it. I 
know I don't like it. I shouldn't speak on behalf of everybody.

But the bottom line is, the President is the President. He is the 
Commander in Chief. He won the election in 2004. So we are left to deal 
with the situation.

And if you look at some of the polling in the country, 76 percent of 
Americans favor requiring U.S. troops returning from Iraq to have at 
least 1 year in the U.S. before being redeployed. That is a Gallup 
poll. Seventy-seven percent favor requiring U.S. troops to come home 
from Iraq if Iraq's leaders fail to meet promises to reduce violence 
there. And 76 percent of the American people don't think the Bush 
administration has done everything they could reasonably be expected to 
do to care for the needs and problems of veterans.

But the bottom line is the American people want accountability, and 
the American people want to change course. You don't see the kind of 
tidal wave election that we had in November without a message that 
comes with it. And the message is, we need to change direction. And the 
Iraq supplemental bill that passed out of the Appropriations Committee 
today and will pass


off the floor next week is that change in direction.

Is it everything all of us want? No. Are there things in there that 
we don't like? Yes. But we have to change direction in this war. It is 
not going well.

And you talk to the families and, you know, as a Member of Congress, 
I have made the phone calls, other Members of Congress have made the 
phone calls to parents. We have been to the funerals, and it is not 
good. And quite frankly, I don't want to go to any more. But I found 
out yesterday that I have got to go to another one.

This war has got to end, and it has got to stop. And what we are 
doing is the quickest way for us to go about bringing a reasonable, 
thoughtful end to this war, and that means getting our troops out of 
the middle of a civil war in Iraq.

There are only 2,000 al Qaeda members in Iraq. The war on terrorism 
needs to move back to Afghanistan, the country that harbored Osama bin 
Laden. And in this bill there is 1.2 billion additional dollars from 
the President's request to focus back on Afghanistan, because now 
Afghanistan, we are starting to lose our way in Afghanistan now because 
of the lack of focus.

So I think it is very important that the American people recognize 
what is in this bill. There are benchmarks there that the Iraqis need 
to meet. And if they don't begin to meet them and show some progress, 
we start moving out.

We have had 4 years for them to get their stuff together. And for 
whatever reason, they haven't. And think, contrary to what some of my 
friends on the other side have been saying, and the President has said, 
and people who have kids and everything realize this, this is very 
basic, that the President is saying, well, if you give them a 
benchmark, then they are just going to wait us out, and then we leave, 
and then they will take over, like everything is great right now, and 
then it will get bad. But it is bad right now.


What we are saying is if we communicate to the Iraqis that we are 
going to stay there indefinitely, then they will never get their stuff 
together because they are always relying on us. And what we are saying 
is, we are not going to be there indefinitely; you better start getting 
along with each other.

And I hate even saying that because I didn't want this war to happen 
in the first place. Now we broke them and now we are saying, get your 
stuff together.

But the bottom line is this, we are where we are, and they need to 
get together. And the political and religious factions need to get 
together. And if they don't, we need to leave. And if they do, we need 
to leave.

I think we have spent enough money, 400, going to be $500 billion in 
Iraq. $500 billion. And 3,100-plus lives, 20-some thousand soldiers who 
have been amputees, brain injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Enough is enough. Enough is enough. It is time to bring this war to an 
end. And that is what our supplemental ultimately does.

And so, in closing, I would just like to say, Madam Speaker, that the 
last 3 weeks we have had hearings in our Labor, Health and Education 
Subcommittee, and we have had great people testifying on health care in 
the United States, education in the United States, very interesting 
stuff. But there are two things that have really hit home to me as I 
was sitting through these committees with all these experts.

And we had the education experts saying to us that this may be the 
first generation of Americans who will not have the standard of living 
or improved standard of living, compared to that of their parents. That 
was one hearing.

And then the next hearing came in and it was the health care experts. 
And the health care experts were saying that this generation may be the 
first generation of Americans that do not exceed the life expectancy 
level of their parents because of the crisis that we are having in 
health and obesity in the United States. Literally, your parents may, 
if you are a kid, your parents may live longer than you live. First 
time.

And when you look at the money that we are spending to destroy and to 
kill, as opposed to the money that we spend to create and to build up, 
it is tragic. It is tragic. And I hate voting for this stuff, but we 
have to because we have got to get out of there.

But the bottom line is this, we are spending hundreds and hundreds 
and hundreds of billions of dollars, and the Head Start program that 
helps kids get off the ground is being cut by $100 million in the 
President's budget. We are going to fix that. That is not going to end 
up that way.

But when you look at we are spending hundreds and hundreds of 
billions of dollars and flatlining funding on programs like Gear Up and 
TRIO that help young kids get into colleges and that we are not 
covering enough kids with children's health care, I hope we all 
remember this when we get through this war and it is time to make the 
proper investments in our country.

We only have 300 million people in this country. China has 1.3 
billion. India has 1 billion. We need everybody on the field playing 
for us.

Let's put this war to an end. Let's bring our kids home with dignity, 
and make sure that when they get home these veterans have the proper 
health care that they need and that they deserve, and then let's start 
making some investments into this country so that we can be the best 
that we can possibly be.

Madam Speaker, you can e-mail us at 30somethingdems@mail.house.gov, 
or visit us at www.speaker.gov/30something and comment. All of the 
charts that were seen here are on display on the Web site.

And with that, we conclude our 30-something for the week, and we will 
see you next week.
