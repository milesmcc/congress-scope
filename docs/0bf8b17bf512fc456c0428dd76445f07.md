Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I commend Senator Leahy, chairman of 
the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, 
for including an additional $20 million for Iraqi refugees in the 
continuing resolution.

More than 3 million Iraqis have been displaced from their homes, and 
many of them have fled the country. America has a special obligation to 
help them and the neighboring countries in meeting their needs.

The UNHCR has made an international appeal for $60 million to deal 
with this emerging crisis, and the United States plans to provide $20 
million to that appeal.

Our invasion of Iraq led to this crisis, and we have a clear 
responsibility to do more to ease it. We should provide at least half 
the funding for this $60 million appeal to help this growing refugee 
population.

I believe $10 million of the funds in this bill should be for the 
UNHCR appeal, in an effort to raise the total U.S. contribution to $30 
million. Is that the chairman's intent?
