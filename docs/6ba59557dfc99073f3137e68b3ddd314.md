`Mr. KLINE of Minnesota â€” 10 September 2007`

Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. If the gentleman would yield for just a 
minute, that's what struck me is that, very much like General Petraeus' 
testimony today, the media discussion and the political discussion and 
the partisan discussion that led up to the testimony simply didn't 
match the testimony that we heard in either of these hearings.

For example, I'm sure that many of our colleagues were surprised, and 
frankly I was, to hear General Petraeus say that it's tough but we're 
making progress, and we're making progress to the point where I'm going 
to recommend that we draw down our forces to the presurge level of 
brigade combat teams and we do it by next July. I was surprised that he 
put that date in there and that certainty in there when he made that 
statement.

He said we're going to start drawing down this year, brigade combat 
team is going to come back, Marine expeditionary unit is going to come 
back, and we're going to continue to draw down through the spring and 
into the summer. And that is consistent with the original intent of the 
surge. It was temporary with what the Iraq Study Group said about a 
temporary surge, and in fact, I think it's very consistent with what 
the Jones commission said as well.
