# HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010
## `b9ef1927a7802a508143dacb006bfe10`
`Mr. REID â€” 24 March 2010`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, USA Today-Gallup reported that the people of 
America, the citizens of America, favor what we did by a score of 49 to 
40. That is a pretty significant majority. People support this 
legislation. Why? Because they are tired of being treated by the 
insurance industry the way they have been treated.

My friend talks about the mountain of debt of this bill. We have 
rules and guidelines in this body, in this Congress, and one of them is 
we have an independent body that has been set up, not by Republicans, 
not by Democrats, but by us. It is independent. It is not partisan. 
That agency, the Congressional Budget Office, determined this bill over 
the first 10 years will save about $140 billion; over the next 10 
years, $1.3 trillion. This is make-believe they talk about all these 
things that are going to cost so much--$1.3 trillion.

I also have to comment on this. My friend, the Republican leader, 
talks about how hard they were working yesterday when we were at a 45-
minute meeting at the White House while the President made history 
signing for the first time in 100 years major health care reform in 
this country. They were working so hard here. They were working so hard 
today that they refused to let committees meet to hold sensitive, 
important hearings for our country.

Carl Levin had to cancel a meeting because the Republicans refused to 
allow that meeting to go forward, dealing with the safety and security 
of this Nation. Claire McCaskill, with her subcommittee, had to cancel 
a hearing dealing with having police officers trained in Afghanistan. 
Canceled. Working hard, they are, to throw a monkey wrench in 
everything we are trying to do for the American people.


To in any way denigrate, as has been done this afternoon, Chairman 
Max Baucus and Chairman Chris Dodd and the work done by the man 
replacing Ted Kennedy is an outrage. Max Baucus devoted his life to 
this legislation for the last 2 years: the number of roundtable 
discussions with Finance Committee members and invited guests, 3; the 
number of papers outlining health care reform, significant, important 
papers that were distributed to everybody around the country interested 
in health care, 4; the number of meetings of the Gang of 6--three 
Republicans and three Democrats--31 meetings; the number of member 
meetings on health care reform, 141.

These are not back-room deals. This is how business is conducted in 
the Senate.



The number of days in the Finance Committee the bill was available 
before the markup even took place, 6; the total number of amendments 
posted online before the markup, 564. They were public. Everyone in 
America could read them. The number of amendments considered during the 
markup, 135; the number of days the committee spent marking up the 
bill, 8; the number of days the final bill was available before the 
vote, 11.

There is more, but you get the picture.

Chairman Dodd conducted the longest markup in the history of the HELP 
Committee. On what subject? Health care. Public meetings, many of them 
on C-SPAN.

There is no bill anymore. It was signed into law yesterday. The work 
that we did here on Christmas Eve, through the storms of 2010, is now 
the law of this country. We are going to start in just a few minutes 
making that law even better.

In my State of Nevada, 600,000 people will be able to have insurance 
who have never had it before; 24,000 small businesses will be eligible 
for a subsidy for people they employ to have health insurance. They did 
not have health insurance because they were cheap or mean; they could 
not afford it. If they would get a palsy, they would cancel when 
somebody got sick or hurt.

Now someone who is 26 years old can go to college or do whatever they 
want to do and not worry about losing their insurance until they 
establish themselves.

This legislation extends Medicare for 9 years as a healthy entity. 
Medicare is not a perfect program, but it is a good program.

My first elective job was a countywide job in Las Vegas, the 
metropolitan areas Clark County. When I went on that hospital board, 
the largest district in Nevada, 40 percent of seniors who came into 
that hospital had no health insurance. Their sons, their daughters, 
their mothers, their brothers, their cousins, their neighbors signed 
for them that they would be responsible for that bill. We had a large 
collection agency in that hospital. We went after those people.

Not anymore. Now everybody who is a senior citizen who comes into 
that hospital is taken care of because of Medicare. We extend the life 
of that program for about 9 years.

I had a letter written to me by a man from Nevada. He wrote to me and 
he said: Senator, I have a son who has diabetes, but it has become more 
complicated. Now he has Addison's disease. I lost my job. We have no 
health insurance. When I go to bed at night and say my prayers, I don't 
know whether to die or stay alive to help my son. That is how desperate 
he is.

People such as this man from Nevada are no longer going to have to be 
desperate. No longer are we going to have 750,000 people file for 
bankruptcy, 70 percent of them because of health care costs and 80 
percent of the 70 percent have health insurance.

The bill that is now the law of this country dealing with health care 
is a wonderful bill, and we are going to improve it tonight.
