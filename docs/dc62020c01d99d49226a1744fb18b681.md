Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator responding to 
me. I will simply say that I virtually agree with that general 
proposition that we need to be able to have the information and we need 
to stop terrorist attacks, and I am glad we were able to do it in 
Georgia.

But the fact is, al-Qaida is operating in 80 countries around the 
world, and because of putting so much focus on Iraq, including so much 
focus of our intelligence system in Iraq, we don't have the adequate 
resources to preempt terrorist attacks throughout the world. That is 
the very problem. There are terrorist attacks going on in places such 
as Algeria and Morocco and Afghanistan and Southeast Asia, and because 
we are so consumed with Iraq, we can't pursue the very notion of 
preempting the terrorist attacks to which the Senator from Georgia 
properly refers.

I yield the floor.
