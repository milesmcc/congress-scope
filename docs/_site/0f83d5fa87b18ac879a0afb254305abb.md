Mr. KUCINICH. The Washington Post reports that nearly $1 billion a 
year in cash, suspected to include U.S. aid, opium trade receipts, or 
both, is moving from Afghanistan to Dubai, where friends and family of 
Afghanistan's President Karzai have multimillion dollar villas. Dubai 
real estate deals and a number of crooked enterprises connected to the 
Karzai family have created crony capitalism in a country awash in U.S. 
cash and U.S. blood.

Nearly 1,000 U.S. soldiers have died, and for what? Hundreds of 
billions spent, and for what? To make Afghanistan safe for crooks, drug 
dealers, and crony capitalism?

Next Thursday I will bring a privileged resolution to this House so 
that Congress can claim our constitutional right to end this war and to 
bring our troops home. Please support the resolution.
