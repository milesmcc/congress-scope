Mr. HOEKSTRA. No, I will not yield. And I know that this colleague 
has been very sympathetic to making us and fixing this problem, and I 
appreciate his efforts in this area.

But if we go back to knowing that we have had this information for 
more than 6 months, we have not dealt with this information. Go back to 
the ''op ed'' that the Director of National Intelligence wrote in May. 
And this bill that we are dealing with today concerns children. But, as 
the DNI has said, this surveillance saves lives, the lives of our 
children and grandchildren. That is what we are talking about.

What do we do to keep the homeland safe? What do we do to keep our 
troops safe? Because we are talking about gathering intelligence from 
foreign targets in places like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq.
