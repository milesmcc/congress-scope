Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that information. Of course it 
is a challenge, but it is a challenge that we need to meet in some way 
usually before we can move with the appropriations process. But on 
appropriations on the supplemental, there were conflicting reports this 
week that there might be a supplemental for Afghanistan and another 
supplemental for Iraq, and then there were reports that no, the 
committee would report out one supplemental bill. I am wondering if the 
gentleman knows whether there will be one or two bills, and are we 
still anticipating a markup of that bill next week and then floor 
action following next week?

I yield.
