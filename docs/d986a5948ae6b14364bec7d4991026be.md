# NO END BUT VICTORY

`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 6 February 2007`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as debate continues 
surrounding President Bush's new way forward in Iraq, I hope all sides 
are heard.

I am a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard. I 
have four sons serving in the military, the eldest of whom served for a 
year in Iraq. I sit on the Armed Services Committee, and I have visited 
Iraq six times and Afghanistan twice. I am committed to my family and 
our Nation's survival and prosperity, all of which will be threatened 
should we not triumph in the global war on terrorism.

As elected public officials, Members of Congress have an obligation 
to debate war strategy and exercise congressional oversight. If by 
conscience they disagree with the President's direction, they have a 
responsibility to put forth an alternative plan.

Political posturing in the form of nonbinding resolutions, however, 
brings nothing to the debate regarding the protection of American 
families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
