Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Chairman, I understand that people don't like to pay 
taxes. Neither do I, unless those taxes are used for wise and important 
purposes. And if the gentleman is so concerned about every taxpayer 
that doesn't want to pay taxes, then why are we still in Iraq?

The amounts of money you are concerned with you said is a very small


amount of money. And it is, to you. It is not to Sister Janet and to 
the students at Emmanuel College. And if you are that concerned with 
it, all you have to do is just shut down Iraq for less than 30 seconds 
and you would have this money available to us. So I don't believe that 
the real concern is tax money, because if it were, we wouldn't be 
having this debate. We would be having a debate on another matter that 
is much more financially irresponsible.
