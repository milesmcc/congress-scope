Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, all year this Democratic Congress has 
worked to live up to our promise to move the Nation in a new direction. 
In many ways, we have been successful, raising the minimum wage, fully 
implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and making college 
more affordable. We are proud of these accomplishments, but there are 
many other important bills that have been passed with strong bipartisan 
support here in Congress, only to be vetoed by President Bush.

We sent the President a bipartisan bill that restored harmful cuts to 
No Child Left Behind, job training programs, and research grants for 
cures for life-threatening diseases. President Bush said no with his 
veto pen.

We sent him a bipartisan bill that would ensure 10 million children 
have access to quality health care. President Bush said no with his 
veto pen.

We sent him a bill that would bring our troops home from Iraq by the 
end of next year. Again, President Bush said no with his veto pen.

Madam Speaker, President Bush has stood in the way of real progress, 
but know that we in Congress will continue to fight to move our Nation 
in a new direction.
