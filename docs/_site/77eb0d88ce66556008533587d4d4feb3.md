Mr. SHULER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1332, the Small 
Business Lending Improvements Act of 2007.

As an entrepreneur, I understand the difficulties that small business 
owners face on a daily basis. I also know that small businesses are the 
backbone of our economy, both nationally and in western North Carolina.

Small businesses account for over half of all of our jobs in the U.S. 
and are responsible for 60 to 80 percent of all of our new jobs. For 
our small businesses to continue to grow and prosper, we must help them 
gain access to capital.

The bill will grant American entrepreneurs that access to capital by 
updating and streamlining SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan programs. 
Additionally, this bill will eliminate loan fees for veterans returning 
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

As a member of the Small Business Committee, I urge all Members to 
support this important legislation.
