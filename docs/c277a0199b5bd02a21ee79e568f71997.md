Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, the Chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee has come under some harsh criticism for 
suggesting the money we make available to Afghanistan and Pakistan be 
conditioned. Chairman Obey is right. When you consider the fact that we 
have put $33 billion into Afghanistan and $12 billion into Pakistan 
without conditions, you have to ask ''What has it gotten us?''

We seem to be losing the war in Afghanistan because the leadership of 
the enemy has a haven in Pakistan. Of all the money we have given to 
the military in Pakistan, they have 450,000 trained, equipped troops on 
the southern border with our ally India and one brigade on the north 
where we need them. Former members of the ISI affiliated with the Pak 
army located just south of Lahore, Pakistan trained and executed a 
massacre of 152 people in Mumbai, India.

They just released an extremist cleric that is arguing for sharia law 
across the land. They have just allowed the Swat Valley to be taken 
over by the Taliban. Of course we need our money conditioned. If they 
want American taxpayers' money, they need to start serving America's 
interests.
