`Mr. KINGSTON â€” 30 January 2007`

Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I think that there is a good part to the 
Democrat takeover of the House and the Senate, and that is that now the 
Democrats are at the table when we talk about Iraq. And there are many 
in this town who say failure is not an option. I think failure is an 
option. I think there would be disastrous consequences to that. The 
third largest oil-producing nation in the world would belong to 
terrorists. What would happen to the existing and fledgling Iraqi 
Government if you suddenly pulled our troops out of there? What kind of 
genocide would that bring? Those are things that have to be dealt with.

But I think that it is good that now we can have a bipartisan 
approach that the critics of the administration and the policy are now 
inside the room actually making policy. With that spirit, I think that 
it is time to tone down the rhetoric and work on a solution that will 
be best for Iraq, for America, and for the international community. And 
I say this with sincerity now because I think there is a good 
opportunity, and we only will have it, I think, for a few short months 
because the Presidential elections are kicking in, lots of rhetoric is 
floating around, but I think we can work together and come up with some 
good policy.
