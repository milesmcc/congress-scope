Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Nation's 
veterans and to thank Chairman Filner for his leadership on veterans' 
issues. Tomorrow, the House is expected to consider S. 1963, major 
legislation to improve the VA which includes legislation I introduced, 
the Caring for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Act.

In order to meet the treatment and rehabilitation needs of veterans 
suffering from traumatic brain injury, my bill establishes a Committee 
on Care of Veterans with TBI, which has become the signature wound of 
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

We must continue our efforts to provide veterans and their families 
with the best possible health care. The Committee on Care of Veterans 
with Traumatic Brain Injury will help provide improved TBI education 
and training programs for VA health professionals which will benefit 
our men and women returning from combat.

I want to thank all of the men and women serving in our Armed Forces 
as well as our Nation's veterans.
