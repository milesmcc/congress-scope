Mr. FEINGOLD. I wish to ask the Senator through the Chair--he 
indicated that our strategy vis-a-vis al-Qaida after 9/11 has to do 
with the doctrine of preemption. I am intrigued by that. I know that 
was a justification for going into Iraq, but I wonder if the Senator 
could explain how the doctrine of preemption is going to help us 
against an organization that is existing in some 80 countries in the 
world. Are we going to invade and preempt 80 different nations?
