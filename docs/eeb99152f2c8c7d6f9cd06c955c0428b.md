Mr. CHABOT. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6456, which provides stopgap 
extensions of certain important State Department and broadcasting 
authorities until the Committee on Foreign Affairs can take them up as 
part of a comprehensive authorization during the 111th Congress.

In response to administration requests, this brief bill does a number 
of things. It extends for another year the State Department's authority 
to hire retired Foreign Service officers for difficult-to-staff posts 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to address visa and passport processing 
backlogs.

It also extends authorities for Radio Free Asia, and for emergency 
broadcasting needs in the International Broadcasting Bureau and the 
Voice of America. It also makes clear that the State Department may pay 
the hotel expenses of its special agents on protective details in 
situations where agents are required to remain with their protectees 
overnight, even when that duty occurs in the agent's home locale.

Finally, it incorporates the text of H.R. 3658, the House-passed bill 
introduced by the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Fortuno) to allow 
U.S. Foreign Service officers to take their rest and recuperative 
travel in U.S. territories. I urge support for this measure.

I reserve the balance of my time.
