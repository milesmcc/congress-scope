Mrs. HALVORSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the success 
of ''Operation Cookie Share,'' a collaborative effort of the Girl 
Scouts of Central Illinois and the State Farm Military Affinity Group. 
This year, customers purchasing Girl Scout cookies were able check on 
their order form whether they wanted to donate extra boxes of cookies 
to our troops. As a result of this effort, over 86,000 boxes of Girl 
Scout cookies were sold and delivered to our troops serving in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, military hospitals in the U.S. and overseas, and USO hubs 
at major American airports for deploying and returning troops.

Our sons and daughters fighting for us overseas put their lives on 
the line every day and everything we can do to make their lives easier 
helps. These cookies aren't just a treat; they're a simple reminder of 
home and a simple gesture of thanks from a grateful community. I'm 
proud to support the great members of the Girl Scouts of Central 
Illinois and the State Farm Military Affinity Group, and honor the work 
done by so many in our community to thank our troops.
