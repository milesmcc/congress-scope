# BLUE DOG COALITION

`Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. In essence what that component says 
is that in a bipartisan way we want to be sure that the Iraqis have a 
surge in leadership for their own country, take over the control of 
their own country; that the Iraqis develop the military that they need 
to occupy their own country themselves. And, secondly, that they become 
the policemen in the field, on the roads, riding the Humvees, and not 
our soldiers. I thank my friend from Arkansas for each week that you 
bring to the American public the views, the ideas of the fiscal 
conservative Blue Dog Democrats, deficit hawks and defense hawks here 
on the House floor.
