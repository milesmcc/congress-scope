Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Senior Airman 
Jason Dorian Nathan on the first anniversary of his death due to 
hostile fire while stationed in Iraq.



Senior Airman Nathan was a 2004 graduate of Central High School in 
Macon, Georgia. His strong sense of patriotism, honor, and commitment 
to excellence led him to proudly enlist in the United States Air Force. 
He planned to resume his studies at Fort Valley State College and 
University, where he pursued a degree in Criminal Justice prior to his 
enlistment in 2005.

Madam Speaker, on June 1, 2008, the 48th Fighter Wing dedicated a 
Vehicle Entry Gate at RAF Lakenheath in honor of Senior Airman Nathan. 
The plaque which commemorated the event reads, ''This gate is 
memorialized in the name of Senior Airman Jason D. Nathan who was 
assigned to the 48th Security Squadron, 48th Fighter Wing, RAF 
Lakenheath, England. Senior Airman Nathan was mortally wounded by an 
improvised explosive device on 23 June 2007 while on a combat patrol in 
Tikrit, Iraq in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. He gave his life 
providing courageous support to his squad while protecting the people 
of Iraq in their pursuit of freedom from oppression and terror. Senior 
Airman Nathan's heroic actions and unselfish dedication upheld the 
highest traditions of the Security Forces career field and the United 
States Air Force.'' Senior Airman Nathan was also honored at ceremonies 
in Iraq and in Afghanistan.

Senior Airman Nathan's selfless service to his country, his 
willingness to pay the ultimate sacrifice so that all of us can enjoy 
the fruits of liberty, his desire to see the Iraqi people live in a 
free and democratic society, are all attributes of an outstanding young 
American to whom we all owe a great debt of gratitude and respect.

Madam Speaker, I am confident my colleagues will join me in 
recognizing the heroism, patriotism and fidelity of Senior Airman Jason 
Dorian Nathan.
