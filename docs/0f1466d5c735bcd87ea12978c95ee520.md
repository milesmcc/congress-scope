`Mr. ROSS â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. ROSS. There are eight points that we make in this bipartisan 
compact on Iraq debate on how we move forward. The second one, we agree 
that efforts to eliminate funding for U.S. forces engaged in combat and 
in harm's way in Iraq would put at risk the safety and security of our 
servicemembers. In other words, as long as we've got troops in harm's 
way, we're going to support them.

We agree that there must be a clearly defined and measurable mission 
for our continued military involvement in Iraq. Again, stop redefining 
victory. Stop moving the goal post. This mission must be further and 
continually defined so that the military and the country are aware of 
the end goal of our mission in Iraq and what progress toward that goal 
is being achieved.

We agree that the Government of Iraq must now be responsible for 
Iraq's future course. The government must continue to make progress on 
the legislative benchmarks outlined in section 1314 of the recent 
Supplemental Appropriations Act, public law 110-28. Demand 
accountability from the Iraqis.
