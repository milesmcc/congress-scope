Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to my colleague, 
because I think it's important that we make sure that we have 
everything on the table and that we are very clear about who we are 
standing for and who we are putting the burdens on.

What is clear to me is that we have the finest military in the world, 
that we have men and women, sons and daughters, spouses, brothers and 
sisters, employees, friends and neighbors that have decided to give 
their country their time, ultimately, perhaps, pay the sacrifice, the 
ultimate sacrifice, and go fight for the American people and their 
ideals to protect us here at home.

We have an opportunity today to do what is right, to do what the 
Pentagon has not done for many reasons. I know my colleagues want to 
make this about the Iraq war, but I know this is really about our 
families and our troops.

If we cannot guarantee them some predictability for their dwell time 
at home, for retraining and rest, we are going to continue to degrade 
the readiness of our military. We are in no shape in this very 
dangerous world to continue on that path.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my friend and colleague, the 
gentlelady from California (Ms. Waters).
