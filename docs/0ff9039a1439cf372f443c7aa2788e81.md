`Mr. SESSIONS â€” 20 September 2007`

Mr. SESSIONS. I will give my best answer to that. We had the 
President of the United States and the majority leader in the Senate 
say we had to have an immigration bill. They tried to pass it right 
here on the floor of the Senate. They could not pass it. The President 
could have stood on his head, and that bill would not pass.

Just because we think we can order the Iraqi Parliament to vote out 
some law doesn't mean they can do that. So I am really worried about 
it, frankly. I am fully willing to acknowledge that it is a very 
troublesome development that the Iraqi Parliament hasn't been able to 
pass laws to carry out some of these needed reforms. But I don't think 
they are going to be more likely to be effective in passing legislation 
if we precipitously withdraw, allowing violence to increase again and 
whatever


else might happen, with Iran expanding its influence.

I have to tell you that the substantial reduction in violence we have 
seen is not small. This is really large. If you told me when the surge 
started that we would see a 70-percent reduction in civilian deaths in 
Baghdad, I would not have believed it. I would have thought that would 
be more optimistic than I was prepared to be. So whether it will hold, 
I don't know. We have seen some improvement.

I know the Senator from Massachusetts would like to speak. I will 
just conclude by saying, OK, we have had these reports, we have seen 
this progress, and we know what the difficulties are. I have decided, 
based on General Petraeus's testimony, the Crocker testimony, the Jones 
Commission report, and other information we have, that things are 
moving in a better direction.

I personally believe it is the new tactics, not so much the number of 
soldiers. I am very happy General Petraeus has concluded he can draw 
down troops while maintaining this progress of reducing violence. In 
fact, he has recommended that within the next few weeks, a Marine unit 
not be replaced. So that represents an initial reduction in our forces 
within a few weeks. Then the next reduction will come before Christmas 
will be an Army brigade, and he would have 30,000 troops withdrawn by 
next summer and would report to us again in March on whether he could 
continue this rate of reduction or accelerate it.

There is not that much difference, I say to my colleagues, in what we 
want. Senator Levin wants to see troops withdrawn. He wants to see a 
stable Iraq. The question is, Do we do it with a mandated withdrawal 
rate dictated by Congress or do we do it in harmony with the situation 
on the ground that leaves us in the best possible position to allow a 
stable, peaceful Iraq, an ally to the United States, to exist?

I think we should accept the report. We should see this as good news, 
celebrate that some progress has been made and recognize that serious 
challenges are out there. I do believe Congress has every right to 
monitor this situation closely. We have every right to reject the 
President's recommendation, to reject General Petraeus's 
recommendation, to cut off funds and order our troops home if we so 
desire. I think that would not be a good decision. I think it would not 
be in the long-term interests of the United States of America. 
Therefore, I oppose the Levin amendment.

I yield the floor.
