# NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011--MOTION TO
## `438eaf46b108ffc1d56d8faba7d0f421`
`Mr. FRANKEN â€” 21 September 2010`

---


Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss two important issues we 
will not have the chance to debate because we are unable to take up the 
Defense authorization bill.

Let me start with the need for repeal of the discriminatory don't 
ask, don't tell policy. We are so close to making a historic 
accomplishment that I think we would be able to look back on with 
pride. It is also simply the right thing to do. This country is long 
past ready for it, and it is the right thing because the don't ask, 
don't tell policy has been costly for our military. Treating gays and 
lesbians unequally because of their sexual orientation just does not 
make sense to me. We should not be denying gay and lesbian Americans 
the ability to serve our Nation simply because of who they are. We 
should not make them lie in order to serve.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, endorsed 
the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. He put it this way:




 I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in 


 place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about 


 who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens. For 


 me, personally, it comes down to integrity: theirs as 


 individuals and ours as an institution.


But as I said, this is not just about the right thing to do. The 
country is ready for it, and the military is ready for it. Things have 
changed since 1993. The country is now way ahead of us on this issue. A 
Washington Post/ABC News poll in February 2010 showed that 75 percent 
of Americans believe gay and lesbian Americans should be able to serve 
openly in the U.S. military--75 percent. There is almost nothing we can 
get 75 percent of the country to agree on these days. The country has 
been steadily moving in this direction for some time. In 1993, 44 
percent of those surveyed favored this. It was up to 62 percent in 
2001. And now we are at 75 percent. Multiple other polls reinforce this 
result. The country is way past being ready for this change, and so is 
the military.

Do we need to think carefully about how to implement repeal? Yes. 
That is why the Pentagon is undertaking a comprehensive review of how 
to implement the repeal. But is there any reason to think unit cohesion 
or military readiness is going to be negatively affected? No. There is 
simply no reason to think that. In fact, let's look to the military's 
own thinking on this question. A recent article in Joint Force 
Quarterly concluded that ''there is no scientific evidence to support 
the claim that unit cohesion will be negatively affected if homosexuals 
serve openly.'' No scientific evidence.

Let me also briefly tell you about my experience. Before I was a 
Senator, I did a number of USO tours over the years. On each tour, I 
was more and more impressed with the men and women of the military. 
This was between 1999 and 2006. I did seven tours. The last 4 years, I 
was in Iraq and Afghanistan and Kuwait. I would go with a very eclectic 
tour of guys and women: the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, country 
western artists, almost all of whom are very rightwing, and we love 
each other because we went on these tours.

Let me tell you about one show I did. I am not going to say what base 
it was. I do not want to get anybody in trouble. We did a 4-hour show. 
This was the fourth year we did this with the sergeant major of the 
Army. We did a 4-hour show because we found out the troops loved the 
show because it was a little bit of home. During the show, I would--I 
was kind of the cohost with a beautiful woman named Leeann Tweeden, and 
we would do comedy routines, we would introduce music, and we would 
introduce the cheerleaders.

I would go out and do a monologue. This is something I would do and 
had done for a number of years. I would go out and I would say: You 
know, I have done now seven USO tours, and every year I am just more 
and more impressed with the military, except for one thing I don't get. 
It is this whole don't ask, don't tell policy.

Now, it was about 28 degrees where I was talking, and there were 
maybe a couple thousand troops. Most of them were standing, some were 
in the bleachers. This was like 3 hours into the show, but they were 
just loving the show.

I said: But there's one thing I don't understand. It is this don't 
ask, don't tell policy. We all know that brave gay men and women have 
served in our country's uniform throughout its history, and yet we have 
this policy. Take, for example, General Smith.

I then pointed to the commander of the base.

I said: Now, here is one of the bravest men ever in the history of 
our country


to don our Nation's uniform in battle, and yet he is one of the gayest 
men I have ever met.

And they started laughing and cheering.

I said: Now, why should General Smith have to stay in the closet when 
he is such a great leader? General Smith, stand up and wave.

He got up and waved, and everyone cheered. And in the bleachers there 
was a group of women soldiers who cheered extra loudly and waved at 
him, and he waved back at them.

At the very end of the show, we sang ''American Soldier'' by Toby 
Keith.

I don't know if you know that song. It is a beautiful song. I will 
always remember while doing the USO tours seeing soldiers with their 
arms around each other crying and singing: I don't do it for the money. 
I've got bills that I can't pay.

At the end of the show, the general came up and gave me this 
beautiful frame with an American flag that had flown over the base. He 
gave it to every member of our troop. When he gave it to me, he said, 
''Al, keep telling those don't ask don't tell jokes. I think you may 
have some fans up there.'' And he pointed at those women. Later, those 
women came up to me and said, ''We are gay.'' And I think everybody 
knew it.

This was in 2006 when it was really hard for the military to recruit 
people, so they gave waivers out at that time. They gave waivers--moral 
waivers. They gave waivers for people who didn't do as well in school 
or didn't graduate from school. I swear, if you asked every man and 
woman on that base: Who would you rather have standing to your right 
and left, that gay man or that gay woman who has been serving with you 
for the last year or somebody who comes in here with a moral waiver--
and many of those troops who had moral waivers served very honorably 
and bravely--or someone with a cognitive waiver--and many of those 
flourished in the military--they would say: I want that gay soldier, 
that lesbian soldier, who I know has been on my right and on my left.

All gay and lesbian servicemembers want is to be able to serve. 
Instead, people are getting kicked out of the military--people who 
don't need any kind of conduct waiver, people who don't need standards 
lowered for them in order to serve, people who are patriotic and 
courageous and who have vital, irreplaceable skills.

What is more, the evidence is clear from other countries that have 
allowed gay and lesbian citizens to serve openly in their military--and 
Susan Collins spoke about this today. That evidence says this will not 
be a problem. Ask the Israelis, ask the Canadians, and ask the British. 
They have all successfully implemented open service.

But it is not only that the military is ready for this change; don't 
ask, don't tell is just costly for the military. Thousands of willing 
and capable Americans with needed skills have been kicked out of the 
military because of this foolish policy--and this policy alone. These 
are soldiers, airmen, and sailors in whom we have invested time and 
training. We cannot afford to lose dedicated personnel with critical 
skills when we are engaged in two wars.

On top of that, do we want our military officers spending valuable 
time and resources investigating and kicking troops out of the military 
for being gay?

The argument offered by some opponents is that this legislation goes 
back on the promise to take into account the comprehensive review being 
conducted by the Pentagon, but that is just a canard.

Let me remind you what Secretary Gates said about the review when he 
testified before the Armed Services Committee back in February. 
Secretary Gates said:




 I fully support the President's decision. The question 


 before us is not whether the military prepares to make this 


 change, but how we best prepare for it.


Not whether, but how. That process is going forward, and the 
provision in this bill repealing the flawed don't ask, don't tell 
policy does nothing to interfere with the Pentagon's process. All the 
provision does is repeal the existing law. It does not tell the 
Department of Defense how to implement the repeal.

What is more, the repeal itself doesn't even go into effect until 
after the Pentagon's comprehensive review is complete and the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff have certified that the Department of Defense has prepared the 
necessary policies and regulations for implementation. They must also 
certify that the implementation is consistent with military readiness 
and effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention.

To be honest, I am not fully satisfied with that compromise. I wanted 
a moratorium on discharges. But that is the compromise, and it doesn't 
undercut the Pentagon's review in any way.

Don't ask, don't tell makes no sense. It is foolish, it is unjust, 
and we must end it. The country is ready, the military is ready, and it 
is the right thing to do. I urge all of my colleagues to stand for 
equality and for common sense and to stand for our troops. It is long 
past time to end don't ask, don't tell. We will be proud that we did.

Let me turn to the DREAM Act, which also would have come up if we had 
been able to get cloture and move to the Defense authorization bill.

Minnesota is what it is today because we welcomed immigrants with 
open arms. We welcomed the Swedes, who first tilled our fields and 
built our railroads. We welcomed the Norwegians, who thrived in our 
lumber industry and founded choirs that remain the best in the world 
today. We welcomed the Danes, who made our State a leader in dairy 
farming. We welcomed the Germans, the Finns, the Poles, and the Czechs.

In fact, from the time we were admitted to the Union in 1858 until 
1890, no less than one-third of Minnesotans were born abroad. Today, 
most of the people we welcome don't come from Europe. They don't speak 
Swedish or German. They speak Spanish or Hmong or Somali, and they are 
not one-third of our population. Just 7 percent of Minnesotans were 
born abroad. So there are far fewer immigrants in Minnesota by 
percentage. Mr. President, let me tell you, these folks work just as 
hard and they show just as much promise.

I rise to speak in support of the DREAM Act because just by passing 
this law we can do something remarkable to help those Minnesotans--at 
least some of them. This is a group of young people who were brought 
here by their parents. They were raised as Americans and, for the most 
part, speak English just like you and I. But because their parents made 
a mistake, because their parents broke the law and entered the country 
illegally, or overstayed a visa, these kids are stuck. They can't go to 
college. They can't get jobs. They can't join our military. They are 
out of luck, and our society is going to pay for it.

The DREAM Act would allow these students to reenter society, to come 
out of the shadows of society to study or to serve in our country's 
military.

I want to put faces to the young people of Minnesota who would 
benefit from the DREAM Act. I am going to change their names to protect 
their identity.

There is a young man named Daniel. Daniel came to the United States 
from Colombia when he was 8. He grew up in the suburbs, and he ran 
varsity track and cross-country for his high school. Since he couldn't 
get a driver's license, he took a 2-hour bus ride every day just to get 
to classes at Normandale Community College. In his second year, 
Daniel's father died, leaving Daniel and his mother without any income.

Daniel almost dropped out, but he didn't. Instead, he became the 
first member of his family to graduate from college, with dual 
associate degrees in education and computer science--both with honors. 
Daniel is now at the University of Minnesota. He is trying to get his 
bachelor's degree. But since he can't work, he can't afford to attend 
school full time. So every semester, Daniel saves up all of his money 
to take just one class. He is completing his bachelor's one class at a 
time.

There is another remarkable young Minnesotan, Javier, who came to 
this country at the age of 15. He enrolled in St. Paul High School and 
quickly learned English, and by his senior year was taking advanced 
placement and college courses and volunteering at the State capitol. He 
even started to like the weather in Minnesota.

Today, Javier is an elected leader of student government at a college 
in our


State. He has become a role model not just for immigrants but for all 
his fellow students. Javier wants to dedicate his career to improving 
our educational system. But because of the decision his parents made, 
he can't.

I get letters from students like these all the time. Many of them are 
just as talented, and they all ask me for the same thing: the 
opportunity to work hard for this country. Let me repeat that: They 
only ask for the opportunity to work hard for this country.


Another young woman wrote me to ask:




 We do not want welfare or any money. We are not asking for 


 immunity to the law. We are only asking for a chance to come 


 out to the light and live like any other person.


There are a lot of reasons we should help them. The first reason is 
that it is the smart thing to do. Some of my colleagues have stood here 
and said they couldn't believe the DREAM Act might be included in the 
Defense authorization bill.

In fact, the Defense Department has supported the DREAM Act since the 
Bush administration. This bill is actually a part of our Nation's 
strategic defense plan--hence, the Defense authorization bill. It will 
incentivize and reward students to wear our Nation's uniform, and our 
Nation will be safer because of it.

Here is another reason this is smart. We don't want kids like Javier 
doing dishes. We don't want kids like Daniel taking 10 years to get 
their bachelor's degree. We want them studying, contributing to our 
economy, and serving in our military. But there is a far more important 
reason we should pass the DREAM Act, and that is because it is the 
right thing to do.

Mr. President, there is a passage in Leviticus--a book that appears 
in both the Old Testament and the Torah--which I think is appropriate. 
Leviticus is a book of laws. It is said to describe God's covenant with 
the Israelites. This is chapter 19, verse 33:




 When the foreigner resides with you in your land, you shall 


 not oppress the foreigner. The foreigner who resides with you 


 shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the 


 foreigner as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of 


 Egypt.


Mr. President, these are children, and we need to help them. They 
have learned in our schools, they have played with our kids, and they 
want to serve our country. We just need to give them a chance.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
