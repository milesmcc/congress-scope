`Mr. SMITH of Nebraska â€” 17 October 2007`

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, on Friday October 12, the 
Nebraska National Guard's 1074th returned to a hero's homecoming in 
North Platte, Nebraska. The 1074th, headquartered out of North Platte, 
with detachments in Broken Bow, Ogallala, and Sidney, Nebraska, 
returned to Nebraska after a year-long deployment to Iraq. While in 
Iraq, the 1074th Transportation Company's primary missions were convoy 
security and local humanitarian support.

The 1074th tragically lost one of their own. Sergeant Randy J. 
Matheny, a native of McCook, Nebraska, made the ultimate sacrifice to 
his country on February 4, 2007. I join my fellow Nebraskans in 
offering my sincere sympathy and continued thoughts and prayers for the 
Matheny family.

The reception the 1074th received from families, friends and 
supporters upon their return to Nebraska was truly inspiring, as 
thousands, literally thousands of well-wishers welcomed these American 
heroes home in an incredible display of patriotism and pride. I wish to 
convey appreciation to the 1074th upon their safe return to Nebraska, 
and certainly commend Nebraskans for their amazing show of support in 
giving our soldiers the warm, heartfelt reception they deserve.
