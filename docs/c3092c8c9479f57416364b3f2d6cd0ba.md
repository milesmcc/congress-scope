Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of House Resolution 391, recognizing the employees of 
the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the North Texas 
Commission, the USO, and the people and businesses of North Texas for 
their dedication to the ''Welcome Home a Hero'' program.

The ''Welcome Home a Hero'' program is a daily gathering of 
volunteers to celebrate the homecoming of soldiers returning from Iraq, 
Afghanistan and Kuwait.

The tremendous effort has made the ''Welcome Home a Hero'' program 
one of the largest ongoing community service efforts in North Texas; 
and these committed employees have given of their time so that our 
troops, as well as their families, can be welcomed.

On June 12, the 500,000th soldier will come home for a well-deserved 
2 weeks of rest and recuperation, and I'm proud to share that the 
''Welcome Home a Hero'' program in the Dallas-Fort Worth International 
Airport has been selected by the U.S. military to host this 
celebration; and, Mr. Speaker, I would ask for support when this 
resolution comes up. I know we couldn't do it today, but I extend my 
personal gratitude to the program's volunteers for their efforts in 
supporting our dedicated men and women in uniform who are proudly 
serving our Nation.
