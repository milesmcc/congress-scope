Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me at this time yield 2 minutes to our 
friend from Bridgeport, Connecticut (Mr. Shays), who has made 17 trips 
to Iraq and unfortunately was denied an opportunity to have us consider 
and vote on a very thoughtful amendment that he proposed in the Rules 
Committee last night.
