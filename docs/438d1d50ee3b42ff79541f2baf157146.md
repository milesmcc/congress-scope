Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for 
that very clear statement as one who supported the war in Iraq who has 
withdrawn that support and is sharing with others his feelings about 
why he supported it and why he no longer supports it.

Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from California, one of 
my colleagues on the financial services committee, Representative Brad 
Sherman.
