Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I yield myself as much time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution that 
congratulates Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on the 20th anniversary of 
their declarations on the restoration of independence from the Soviet 
Union.

Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Representative Shimkus, the gentleman 
from Illinois, and a good friend of the Baltic people, for introducing 
this measure today.

In June 1940, Soviet troops occupied the Baltic states under the 
auspices of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and then forcibly incorporated 
them into the Soviet Union. The following year, Nazi Germany invaded 
the Baltic states and illegally incorporated them into the Third Reich.

The Soviet Union re-occupied the Baltic states in 1945 until they 
regained their independence in 1991. During this period of foreign 
domination, thousands of Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians were 
subject to brutal repression, exiled, imprisoned and even executed. The 
United States never recognized the incorporation of the Baltic states 
into the Soviet Union.

I had a chance a few years ago to visit the states with a number of 
other Members, and we heard directly from the people, the government 
leaders about their level of appreciation to the United States for 
taking that position that they were never recognized as Baltic states 
under the Soviet Union.

This policy gave rise to the principle of legal continuity, which 
held that they remained de jure independent during the period of 
illegal occupation.

Furthermore, the people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania never 
relinquished their hope for freedom and democracy. In August of 1989, 
the world watched as an estimated 2 million Balts--over one-quarter of 
the total population--formed a 370-mile human chain that spanned the 
three capitals in a peaceful act of solidarity and defiance of Soviet 
rule.

Just over 6 months later, in March of 1990, Lithuania became the 
first of the Soviet republics to declare independence. Estonia and 
Latvia followed suit within weeks. All three regained their full 
independence in late August 1991, which was recognized by the Soviet 
Union on September 6.

In the intervening 20 years, these states have made remarkable 
progress in reforming their political and economic systems. They have 
joined the family of European democracies, become members of NATO and 
the European Union. Indeed, all three Baltic states are valued 
participants in the ISAF mission in Afghanistan and have worked to 
build stability and prosperity throughout eastern Europe.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution that celebrates an 
important anniversary of our Baltic allies. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing the close relations that our nations have 
continued to enjoy.

I reserve the balance of my time.
