Mrs. BOXER. It is not only curious, it is wrong. That is why I am so 
proud of the work that Senator Conrad and so many others did to make 
this bill a balanced bill that meets the needs of our people. Yes, we 
are giving the President what he is asking for in Iraq. We have been 
critical that the President has not funded Iraq in the regular budget. 
So we are saying: OK. We are not happy about it, but, yes, we will give 
you every penny, plus what you ask for, for Iraq. But for goodness' 
sake, you are getting $102 billion for Iraq. How about $20 billion for 
the needs at home? I think my friend is right. It is curious, and it is 
wrong that he didn't balance his request.
