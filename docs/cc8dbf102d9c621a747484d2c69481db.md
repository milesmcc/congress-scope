Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
resolution marking the sixth anniversary of this vicious attack on 
America.

It was 6 years ago tomorrow when our Nation was irrevocably changed 
as the tragedy struck in the streets of Lower Manhattan, the fields of 
Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon.

Six years later, the pain and anger remain fresh. We still miss those 
lost on that day, and we are still grateful for the heroes who faced 
danger on that day.

When the day was over and as we learned of the loss of nearly 3,000 
Americans, including 700 New Jerseyans, just about 100 from my district 
in one small town, 20 or more were killed, 12 from the same church, we 
knew our Nation had been changed forever.

But amidst the tragedy, we also saw the best of our Nation, neighbors 
and friends consoling one another, Americans from all walks of life 
standing united side by side waving the Stars and Stripes and lighting 
candles to honor those missing or lost.

And while our Nation still faces challenges and still grapples with 
the aftermath of these attacks, we draw strength from the knowledge 
that the character and resolve of America is still strong 6 years 
later.

Today, on the eve of the sixth anniversary of this tragedy as a 
Nation, we remember all those we lost. We embrace those who remain, the 
families of those victims, and we honor those who serve on our behalf 
in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and do it on a hellish environment 
on our behalf. And we honor our firefighters, our police officers and 
our emergency personnel. We bless them for their work. We will never 
forget September 11, 2001.
