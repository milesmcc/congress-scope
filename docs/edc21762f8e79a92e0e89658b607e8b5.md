Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Hall. And again, exceptionally 
well-stated. I think we all understand the costs of war. I think we all 
understand, as Americans, there are going to be times, historically, 
when we have to be prepared to fight and to make the necessary 
commitments.

There are also times when we recognize that, you know, we have to 
look and say, is this the right thing? Is it really achieving our 
national security interests?

I think we've heard over and over again, and I'm on the Foreign 
Affairs Committee. I know many of you are on the Armed Services 
Committee, we've heard about the fact that we have, the real problem, 
the terrorist threat is in Afghanistan or Pakistan or Iran. And 
unfortunately, the strategy that continues in Iraq is one that puts all 
of our resources and assets and our men and women in one location where 
al Qaeda was not a problem initially. There may be some al Qaeda there, 
but we don't have to deal with them necessarily with a 160,000 troop 
contingent.

I'd like to now just bring into our conversation another esteemed 
member of our freshman class, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley).
