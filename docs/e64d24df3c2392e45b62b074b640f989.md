Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the South Carolina National Guard. In 2008 they achieved the 
highest number of judge advocate generals serving in the Nation, 
according to Scott Bell, National Guard historian. This significant 
milestone is a tribute to the South Carolina Bar and to the 
professional leadership of Colonel Barry Bernstein, state judge 
advocate for the South Carolina National Guard. Twenty-four of the 
State's 27 JAGs have been awarded Global War on Terrorism campaign 
medals.

As a former staff judge advocate, I understand and appreciate and 
know firsthand the work that our JAG Corps has done to provide legal 
counsel to our military leadership and to our brave men and women in 
uniform. Theirs is an important part of the defense of American 
families by defeating terrorists overseas. I saw this when I visited 
the 218th Brigade JAG during quarterly visits in the last year at Camp 
Phoenix in Afghanistan.

I commend Colonel Bernstein and Adjutant General Stan Spears for 
their leadership and all the members of the South Carolina JAG Corps on 
this achievement.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th.
