`Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 22 May 2007`

---


Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Arkansas for the recognition. I'll be very brief, which is 
difficult for me to do, being from the mountains of Tennessee. 
Sometimes I get a little wordy. I had one of my folks back home tell me 
that after I'd been here for about a year, he said, Lincoln, you've 
gotten so windy as those folks in Washington, I believe you could blow 
up an onion sack. I'm not sure exactly what he meant by that, but I had 
to tone down my rhetoric somewhat after that.

But it's good to be here to talk about accountability and, quite 
frankly, how the lack of accountability has gotten us in the situation 
we're in in Iraq, as well as in our budget management. When we take a 
look at how the growth of government grew through the 1980s up to the 
early 1990s, in 1992, we were spending roughly 22 percent of gross 
domestic product on national expenditures, on our budgetary process, 
Mr. Speaker.

And through the 1990s, we saw a downsizing of government through the 
Clinton-Gore years, where we were spending roughly 18.5 percent of 
gross domestic product. We now have seen that jump to the point to 
where it's somewhat over 20 percent in gross domestic product. We've 
seen government grow the last 6 years. We saw it downsized during the 
Clinton-Gore administration, and the 12 years prior to that we saw it 
grow to where it was well over 22 percent.

So, when we talk about accountability, let's be sure that America 
understands, Mr. Speaker, that it has certainly not been the Democratic 
Party that has made that happen. Under our management, under our watch, 
we saw a downsizing of government expenditures.

I want to move now to Iraq. I recently had an opportunity to visit 
the White House, Mr. Speaker, with our President, along with 12 or 13 
other Members. We had a very frank conversation. In one of the 
conversations, the comment was made that we have a strong commitment in 
the Middle East, and we do have a strong commitment there.

We denied Hitler during World War II being able to obtain the oil in 
the Middle East. The tanks of Rommel ran out of fuel, and we were able, 
quite frankly, through the mass force we had, 16 million Americans, as 
well as help from Europe during World War II, the Allied Forces were 
able to eventually conquer Germany.

We then continued to be there and have a presence all through the 
Cold War, which also denied the Russians from being able to obtain the 
oil that was there.

There's no doubt in my mind that we're going to be in the Middle East 
for a long time when we leave the war zone and the hostile war zones of 
Iraq.

And as we made that conversation, Mr. Speaker, our President 
certainly agreed with that, that we have a long-term commitment and an 
interest in the Middle East for many years to come, and we will have. 
It's kind of like 1953, in South Korea, when Eisenhower decided a 
cease-fire would be in order, and we signed a cease-fire and have been 
maintaining troops in South Korea since 1953. We'll be in the Middle 
East for a long, long time. After the first Persian Gulf War, we 
maintained a presence there in the Middle East, and we'll still do 
that. It's how we stay that determines whether or not we'll win.

What my real concern is about this situation in Iraq is I don't 
think, Mr. Speaker, this administration, I don't think, Mr. Speaker, 
this President understands the gravity of what's going on in the Middle 
East.

Every country in the Middle East, some our friends supposedly and 
some might continue to be our friends, during the 1950s, 1960s, and 
1970s, the Shah of Iran was also our friend. When the ayatollahs took 
over, we lost that friendship, and Iran no longer maintained our 
friendship. But in places like Saudi Arabia, in Kuwait, in the 
Emirates, when you look at Jordan, King Abdullah, a decree made him 
King, not an election. He is our friend, and I personally like King 
Abdullah, but he had an uncle named Prince Hassan that most folks 
thought would eventually go on to be King of Jordan. That didn't 
happen.

So, when we talk about having a free-standing democracy in the Middle 
East, in Iraq, I'm puzzled somewhat that that becomes one of the major 
objectives to determine whether or not we win. We need to have 
stability in Iraq, stability, Mr. Speaker. My hope is that eventually a 
democracy will occur.

For us to assume that the Shias, the Sunnis and the Kurds, in one of 
the most volatile mixed populations in any country in the Middle East, 
that we, you notice I say we, we're going to use that country as a 
model of how we democratize the Middle East, I think, is a flawed 
failure, will continue to be, and will be something that will be 
unsuccessful.

If, in fact, this administration, led by our President, had decided 
that we ought to have democracy in the Middle East, maybe he should 
have started with this gentleman he's holding hands with, the monarchy, 
the royal family of Saudi Arabia. I wonder how many times this 
administration, Mr. Speaker, how many times this President, Mr. 
Speaker, has talked to the royal family of Saudi Arabia and say, 
wouldn't it be nice to have in Saudi Arabia a thriving democracy, a 
freestanding democracy.



I wonder how many times, Mr. Speaker, this President, Mr. Rumsfeld 
and others, Mr. Speaker, asked the people of Kuwait after being 
liberated in 1991 that you should establish a democracy and not revert 
back to the royal families, to be dictatorial in the decisions that you 
made.

Every nation in the Middle East has a strongman-type government, 
except for Israel and except for Lebanon. Whether it's Syria, whether 
it's Iran, Iraq had theirs, the Emirates, Qatar, every country over 
there has a strongman-type government, and we believe that for us to 
consider having one, that we've got to democratize Iraq. I think that's 
a flawed policy, and, Mr. Speaker, I hope our President engages with 
this Congress to try to find some solutions to how we establish 
stability in the Middle East and certainly in Iraq.

I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding.
