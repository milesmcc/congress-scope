`Mrs. MURRAY â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we had a tremendous debate last night, 
and we are close to a vote today. I am proud of the debate that has 
occurred, and I hope all Senators will shortly vote on the Levin-Reed 
amendment to redeploy our troops from Iraq, to refocus our fight on al-
Qaida, and to support our men and women who serve us overseas.

It is time for President Bush to finally accept what the American 
people already know: the war in Iraq is not making us safer, and our 
troops should not remain in the crossfire of that country's civil war.

Unfortunately, President Bush refuses to listen to the generals, to 
the commissions, and to the experts. He stubbornly insists that leaving 
American troops in the middle of a civil war will somehow cause 
factions that have been fighting for centuries to agree to work 
together.

We have tried that approach, and we have paid dearly. We have given 
the Iraqi Government the time to reach the agreements needed to form a 
stable government. We have done our part. The Iraqi Government has not 
done its part.

We should not ask more Americans to sacrifice their lives for an 
Iraqi government that is unwilling to make even the smallest sacrifices 
for their people and their future.

Because the President refuses to follow a responsible path forward, 
we in Congress must force a change in our country's policy on Iraq. For 
months, Democrats have been trying to force that change.

We have been blocked by Republicans who've continued to support the 
President's ''war without end.'' Now--we are starting to see 
responsible Senators break ranks with the President and work with us to 
improve our security.

The upcoming vote on the Reed-Levin amendment is a test for all 
Senators. Do they stand alone with the President, or do they support 
redeploying our troops and making. America more secure? That is the 
choice every Senator will have to make on this vote.

As we look at the challenges in Iraq--and the threats around the 
world--Democrats want to do four things; redeploy our troops from Iraq; 
refocuses our fight on al-Qaida; rebuild our military; and respect our 
veterans.

That is the responsible way to protect our citizens, keep our country 
safe, and keep our military strong.

We have tried the President's direction, and where had it led us? 
More than 3,600 American service members have been killed and another 
20,000 wounded. We have spent nearly 500 billion taxpayer dollars, and 
under the President's approach there is not end in sight.

It's time for a new direction, and it begins with redeploying our 
troops.

Iraq's civil war cannot be solved by our military. It can only be 
solved when the Iraqis decide for themselves that working together will 
bring them a better future.

As a foreign military power, we cannot force the Iraqis to set aside 
their differences and work together. They have to reach that conclusion 
themselves it Iraq is to ever become a peaceful, stable country.

When I was in Iraq in 2005, I met with the leaders of the various 
factions. Each of them saw themselves as representing their ''one 
group--not as people who needed to come together for the greater 
good.'' Unfortunately, since my visit, those sectarian differences have 
only gotten stronger.

The Iraqis have not made the progress that only they can make, and I 
don't think we should keep asking Americans to risk their lives for an 
Iraqi Government that's not doing its job.

So our first step must be to redeploy our troops out of Iraq. The 
Reed-Levin amendment sets a firm deadline to begin the redeployment 
beginning 120 days after enactment, and it sets April 30, 2008, as the 
date to complete the redeployment.

Now this does not mean that every servicemember will be coming home. 
As Senator Lugar said, we will need to keep some servicemembers in Iraq 
for counterterrorism, for training, and to protect American interests. 
Other troops will be needed in other places around the globe as we stay 
on the offensive against al-Qaida and other terrorists. But under this 
amendment, the bulk of U.S. troops will be redeployment from Iraq.

Second, after we redeploy out troops, we need to refocus our energy 
on defeating al-Qaida.

Today, the Director of National Intelligence released the latest 
National Intelligence Estimate. The report says al-Qaida has 
''Protected and regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack 
capability.''



The report also says that al-Qaida has established a safe haven in 
northwest Pakistan, has operational lieutenants, and still has its top 
leadership in place. And it is determined to strike us here at home.

So while the President has kept our military tied up in Iraq, al-
Qaida has been gaining strength, and we must defeat it.

Third, we need to rebuild our military. According to generals who 
have testified before Congress, the war in Iraq has weakened our 
military's readiness, left our equipment destroyed, hurt our ability to 
respond to disasters at home, and left our troops without fully rounded 
training.

Today, we are forcing a very tough tempo on our servicemembers. The 
Pentagon has extended tours of duties for our troops. The 
administration has deployed troops sooner than planned.

The administration has sent troops without all the training and 
equipment they could have received.

The administration has deployed troops without the down-time at home 
that our servicemembers and their families deserve. In fact, 56 members 
of the U.S. Senate tried to fix that last week with the Webb amendment, 
but a majority of Republican Senators blocked us.

Our military is the best in the world. I believe we need to address 
the strains on our servicemembers, so we can remain the best in the 
world.

The Iraq war is also impairing our readiness by destroying our 
equipment. For example, the Army is supposed to have five brigades' 
worth of equipment pre-positioned overseas. But because of the war in 
Iraq, the Army is depleting those reserves.

General Peter Schoomaker told the Senate in March, ''It will take us 
two years to rebuild those stocks.''

Mr. President, our military is the best in the world. I believe we 
need to address the strains on equipment and personnel, so we can 
remain the best in the world.

To meet the President's surge, the Pentagon has been sending some 
troops to Iraq earlier than planned and keeping other units there 
longer than planned. That means that troops get less time at home, less 
time between deployments, and less time to train.

Commanders are forced to shorten the training their troops receive, 
so they are focusing on the specific training they need for Iraq--but 
not for other potential conflicts.

Now, that makes sense. If there's limited training time, we want all 
that time devoted to their most immediate need. However, many military 
leaders are warning that this fast pace diminishes our ability to 
respond to other potential conflicts.

Here's how the colonel who commands the 1st Marine Regiment put it:




 Our greatest challenge is and will remain available 


 training time, and because that time is limited, our training 


 will continue to focus on the specific mission in Iraq. This 


 has, and will continue to, limit our ability to train for 


 other operations.


Army COL Michael Beech told the Senate in April that he believes our 
training strategy is broad enough to support a variety of other events. 
But he added: ''However, if deployed in support of other emerging 
contingencies, I would be concerned with the atrophy of some specific 
tactical skills unique to the higher-intensity conflicts.''

So military commanders are telling us they are concerned that our 
ability to train for other missions has been limited and certain 
tactical skills have had to take a backseat to Iraq.

We need to make sure our troops are trained for whatever conflict 
they might face, and changing direction in Iraq will allow us to do 
that.

Mr. President, the Iraq war has especially impacted the readiness of 
our National Guard. The chief of the National Guard Bureau, LTG Stephen 
Blum, testified that the readiness of National Guard forces is at an 
historic low. General Blum said that ''Eighty-eight percent of the 
forces that are back here in the United States are very poorly equipped 
today in the Army National Guard.''

Not only do we rely on our Guard and Reserve members around the 
world, but we rely on them here at home to respond to natural disasters 
and emergencies. With fire season upon us on the west coast, I'm very 
concerned that we don't have all the capabilities at home we should 
have.

After the horrible tornadoes in Kansas, the Governor of Kansas said 
that recovery efforts were hampered because there weren't enough 
personnel or equipment. Those resources were in Iraq, not here at home.

COL Timothy Orr of the U.S. Army National Guard told the Senate that 
his brigade's homeland security capabilities have been degraded. He 
testified:




 Our ability as a brigade to perform these [homeland] 


 missions continues to be degraded by continued equipment 


 shortages, substitutions, and the cross-leveling of equipment 


 between the state and nation to support our deploying units.


Finally, we need to respect our veterans. That means keeping our 
promise to meet their needs as a they come home--whether it's for 
healthcare, benefits, education or support.

Since Democrats have controlled Congress, we have made dramatic 
progress for our veterans. First we passed a budget that treated our 
veterans as a priority.

I serve on the Budget Committee and I was pleased to work with 
Chairman Conrad to pass a budget resolution that provides over $43.1 
billion for veterans' care.

Our budget increases funding for veterans by $3.5 billion over the 
President's proposal; funds 98 percent of the independent budget, which 
is devised by veterans service organizations; and it rejects the higher 
fees and copayments that the President had proposed, which would have 
forced more than 100,000 veterans to leave the VA health system.

We also passed a supplemental that for the first time since the start 
of the war provided funding to help met the needs of our veterans.

We provided $1.78 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
help those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, to reduce the backlog 
in benefits, and to ensure medical facilities are maintained at the 
highest level.

And just last week, we added the wounded warriors bill to the Defense 
authorization bill. This proposal will address any of the problems that 
came to light from the Walter Reed investigations. It will ensure 
service members don't fall through the cracks as the move from the 
Pentagon to the VA. It will help us diagnose, prevent and treat PTSD 
and traumatic brain injury. And it addresses the problems with unfair 
disability ratings among other improvements.

Mr. President, it is time to change course in Iraq. So far the 
President has been unwilling to recognize the reality on the ground.

Here in the Senate, we have an opportunity to force the President to 
change course in a responsible way.

The Reed-Levin amendment gives every Senator a choice; either you 
want to stay the course in Iraq and leave Americans in the middle of a 
violent civil war or you believe it's time for a change.

I urge my colleagues to do the responsible thing for our troops, 
their families, our military's readiness and the fight against terror 
by voting for this amendment.
