`Mr. HUNTER â€” 2 August 2007`

Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, let me make this point: we are in two 
warfighting theaters right now, Afghanistan and Iraq. We have troops 
deployed.

We are, by all accounts at this point, doing well in those 
warfighting theaters. Somebody stays in battle space. For the 
gentlelady who asked me, who do you stand with, the planner in the 
Pentagon, or the troops in the field, I would answer very firmly, I 
stand for the troops in the field. I stand for that marine corporal who 
needs to have that gunnery sergeant, who's been there before, who 
understands how you avoid that roadside bomb, who understands how you 
approach that village, who understands how you work that cannon, who 
understands how you interrogate people without risking your own troops.

That comes from experience, and the idea that we are going to deny 
these experienced, noncommissioned officers, these old hands whose 
experience can make the difference between life and death because their 
meter didn't expire when they were back home, and they only got 6 
months' worth of dwell time in country, rather than 7, is the wrong 
reason to vote for this bill.

Please oppose this bill, readiness mandates, with a ''no.''
