Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might 
consume.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment which will enhance 
the GIVE Act by codifying our commitment to ensuring veterans can serve 
and be served within our national service programs.



The purpose of my amendment is to acknowledge the patriotism, 
commitment, and sacrifice made by members of the military and their 
families. In return for their service to our Nation, the least we can 
do is make sure that our national service programs are able to benefit 
veterans and military families.

On a bipartisan basis, the Education and Labor Committee chose to 
incorporate support for veterans in the GIVE Act. My amendment is a 
natural extension of that theme, and I hope it will garner the same 
bipartisan agreement as the underlying bill.

Already, the GIVE Act seeks to increase opportunities for veterans to 
serve and to increase the number of national service programs 
responding to the needs of veterans under AmeriCorps. My amendment 
enhances that effort by prioritizing services for and service by 
veterans throughout all of our national service programs.

The bill before us includes a set-aside within AmeriCorps to support 
programs for veterans. In addition, the bill includes a study of how 
veterans are served and how they can be served more effectively. These 
are positive first steps, but my amendment goes further. Under my 
amendment, the Corporation will be required to place a priority on 
applications that serve veterans or recruit veterans to serve. Rather 
than a fixed set-aside within a single program, this amendment will 
allow us to broaden the reach of service by and in support of veterans.

The Corporation for National and Community Service is required to 
establish priorities when funding national service initiatives. This 
ensures a targeted, effective investment. Under my amendment, included 
among those priorities would be an emphasis on programs that recruit 
veterans into service opportunities, promote community-based efforts to 
meet the unique needs of military families while a family member is 
deployed, and promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs 
of military families when a member of a family returns from a 
deployment.

In addition, this amendment requires the Corporation to report to 
Congress on its efforts to increase the number of veterans serving in 
AmeriCorps and other positions that are eligible for the education 
award.

Veterans, particularly those recently deployed to Afghanistan and 
Iraq, deserve opportunities to reintegrate into their communities 
through service programs funded under the national service laws. This 
amendment will increase those opportunities.

Without this amendment, we will not have the necessary information to 
effectively increase veteran participation in national service 
positions or provide an educational award in exchange for citizen 
service.

At a time when our service men and women are sacrificing on our 
behalf around the world, we should be doing all we can to repay that 
sacrifice. My amendment will make it the explicit policy of the Federal 
Government to encourage the national service programs to focus more on 
the unique needs of those heroes and their families, and to encourage 
more veterans to take advantage of service opportunities under these 
laws.

The GIFT Act is a solid, bipartisan reform package that will 
strengthen our national service laws to make them more accountable, 
efficient, and cost effective.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
