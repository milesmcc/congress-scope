Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the United States illegally attacked and 
invaded Iraq in a war based on lies. Now those same lies are being used 
to tell the American people we must escalate and continue to fund the 
war in the name of the troops. Now, where does this logic end?

The war could go on endlessly as we profess our support for the 
troops. It is time to stop using the troops as pawns. It is time to 
stop using the presence of the troops in Iraq as a reason to keep 
funding the war. It is time to use the money we have now to bring the 
troops home. And when they come home, it is time to take care of our 
veterans.

I have presented this Congress with a 12-point plan to bring our 
troops home, end the occupation, and stabilize Iraq. Yes, we should 
stop the escalation, but we should also end the occupation by ending 
funding for the war.
