Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. First of all, let me ask, if I could, the 
gentleman says, the government of which does not have business interest 
with Iran. Would this wording cover the Government of Iraq?

I would yield if someone would tell me that, that they may not be 
eligible for debt relief. Although we give them a lot of money, I don't 
think we lent it to them. But would someone tell me if this would 
include the Government of Iraq as currently constituted?

I would yield for a response. I yield to anyone who would respond.

I yield to the gentleman from Florida.
