Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentlemen for 
his remarks concerning the legislation that has been recently 
considered and passed in the Congress in providing for the needs of our 
Filipino veterans.

My understanding is it has been requested a little over $200 million 
to provide proper compensation. Sixty years. We're spending $12 billion 
a month on this war in Iraq, and after 60 years, we cannot manage 
ourselves not only morally but as a matter of legal obligation that we 
should have for these fellow patriots who helped us fight the war in 
World War II that we've just now gotten around to trying to provide 
justice and fairness to the system.

So I want to commend the gentleman for noting that, as well as my 
good friend, the gentlelady from Hawaii, the chief sponsor of this 
legislation.
