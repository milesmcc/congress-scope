Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I join with my colleague from the District of Columbia in supporting 
the naming of this post office after Lance Corporal Dennis Veater. He 
was a dedicated marine who enlisted in 2004 upon his high school 
graduation and entered the Marine Corps Reserve at age 17, following in 
the footsteps of his marine sergeant major father. Lance Corporal 
Veater wanted to serve his country, and he wanted to make a difference.

On March 9, 2007, just 2 weeks before his scheduled return to the 
United States, Lance Corporal Veater was mortally injured while 
conducting combat operations in Anbar province, Iraq.

He leaves behind his fiancee, whom he planned to marry upon his 
return, and his 14-month-old son, Dominick.

Lance Corporal Veater did not die in vain. Today Anbar province is 
safer because of the work he and the other marines did there. I join 
with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in thinking it is 
very important to remember this man and the work he did for his family 
back home.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
