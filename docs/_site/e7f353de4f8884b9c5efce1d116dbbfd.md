# NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011

`Mr. ACKERMAN â€” 8 June 2010`

---


Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Chair, several months ago I received a letter 
from a solider who lives in New York. The letter was very similar to 
those that many members of Congress receive from brave servicemen and 
women who reside in their districts. The letter spoke of multiple tours 
through Iraq and Afghanistan, of volunteering for more service even 
after completing enough tours to retire, and of the pride of a soldier 
who loves his country and is willing to sacrifice so much to defend it.

But this letter was not quite the same as those that many of us here 
in the Capitol receive from time to time. You see, despite serving his 
country for more than 20 years, despite volunteering to serve in a 
combat zone to defend America's principles of freedom from tyranny and 
from persecution, and despite receiving two bronze stars for 
meritorious service to his country, the gay soldier who wrote this 
letter is required by United States law to lie about who he is or face 
being discharged from the military.

For 16 years, ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has placed an unthinkable and 
immoral burden on gay and lesbian servicemen and women, who, under 
United States law and unlike their heterosexual counterparts, must hide 
their sexual orientation and their partners from the military. Their 
partners are not eligible for the military spousal benefits to which 
the partners of heterosexual servicemen and women are entitled, 
including health care and better housing. Madame Speaker, ''Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell'' is, by definition, a discriminatory policy.

In the course of tonight's debate, several members have characterized 
the House of Representatives' impending vote to repeal ''Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell'' as a step forward for morality and equality. And it is. 
But, before we collectively pat ourselves on the back for a job well 
done, I would remind my colleagues that tonight's step forward is only 
a result of the giant leap backwards we took when we instituted the 
policy in the first place. Years from now, when our children read about 
''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' in their history books, what will they think 
of a government that so shamefully turned its back on gay servicemen 
and women in the interest of a political compromise?

Madam Chair, politics is a business of grays. Seldom do we have the 
opportunity to vote on legislation that is black or white, moral or 
immoral, right or wrong. Tonight is the rare exception.

For the thousands of gay servicemen and women who so bravely serve 
our country everyday but who live in constant fear of being discovered 
for who they are, for the principles of freedom and equality upon which 
the United States of America was founded, and in the interest of 
righting a wrong that has persisted for far too long, I rise in support 
of the amendment before us and for the patriotic soldier whose letter I 
enclose for the record; a letter in which he implores me: ''If and when 
this issue ever comes up for debate, and even for a vote in Congress, I 
respectfully ask you to remember all the gay military personnel who are 
right now risking our lives to defend the U.S. and its values.''

Madam Chair, that moment has come.



 Hon. Gary Ackerman,


 Member of the House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office 




 Building, Washington, DC.



 Dear Congressman Ackerman: I am a captain in the United 


 States Army Reserve, and am presently deployed to 


 Afghanistan. I am writing to you with regard to the 


 military's so-called ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' (DADT) policy. 


 As you may know, there is currently a strong push in Congress 


 to overturn DADT--under which otherwise qualified gay men and 


 women are still being involuntarily dismissed from service--


 and replace it with a policy of nondiscrimination on the 


 basis of sexual orientation. I strongly support this proposed 


 policy change. I would like to explain the basis for my 


 judgment.



 I am a veteran of both the U. S. Navy Reserve and the U. S. 


 Army Reserve. In the latter I have served as both a sergeant 


 and as a commissioned officer. Since the terrorist attacks of 


 September 11, 2001 I have completed tours of duty in 


 Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait. I was informed that I had 


 completed twenty good years of Reserve military service, and 


 had thus earned the right to retire. But I did not want to 


 retire with my country still at war. So I volunteered for 


 another combat zone deployment, and am serving once again in 


 Afghanistan. I have been at my current duty station------. I 


 recite this brief resume to let you know that I am no mere 


 observer of the military, but rather someone who has 


 dedicated much of my life to our national defense.





 Congressman Ackerman, I am also one of the many gay 


 military personnel who have served our country faithfully in 


 these times of terrorism and war. I want to give you my 


 personal perspective on why DADT is so wrong. First of all, 


 it is widely recognized that a married service member's 


 relationship with his or her spouse has a profound impact on 


 that service member's fitness for duty. Thus, straight 


 married service members are free, within the limits of 


 resource availability and operational constraints, to 


 maintain communications with their spouses. In fact, such 


 communication is actively encouraged. Regular phone calls, e-


 mail, and postal letters really help both the service member 


 and spouse get through the strain of combat zone deployments 


 in particular.



 Many gay service members have committed partners who, every 


 day, face the same stress and make the same sacrifices as do 


 their straight counterparts. But because of DADT, gay service 


 members and their partners have to constantly worry that an 


 overheard telephone call, an intercepted e-mail message, or 


 other type of compromised communication could lead to a 


 degrading, career-destroying investigation. It is wrong, I 


 believe, to place such additional burdens on the back of 


 American patriots.



 I write of these matters from personal experience. When the 


 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred I was in a serious long-term 


 relationship. But the extensive post-9/11 active duty I 


 performed put a serious strain on this relationship. The 


 relationship finally fell completely apart during my first 


 Afghanistan deployment in------.



 As you may know, the military has seen a troubling increase 


 in the service member suicide rate since 9/11. Furthermore, 


 the loss of a serious relationship is one of the critical 


 risk factors that may contribute to such suicides. I 


 experienced this particular risk factor and my situation was 


 compounded by its occurrence in a war zone. Six years later, 


 I can still vividly remember cradling my government-issue 


 pistol in my hands and fighting the urge to blow my own 


 brains out.



 I made it through that crisis. I completed my mission in 


 Afghanistan successfully, and in fact was decorated with a 


 Bronze Star Medal at the conclusion of that tour. I went on 


 to earn a second Bronze Star Medal in Iraq two years later, 


 and was promoted to------ shortly after that.



 What made that crisis particularly difficult was the 


 isolation imposed on me as a result of DADT. A straight 


 Soldier in a comparable crisis could turn to his commander, 


 his first sergeant, or a ''battle buddy'' for help and 


 advice. But such avenues are legally closed to gay troops. If 


 I, for example, had shared the details of my situation with 


 my commander--a decent and honorable man--he would have been 


 legally obligated to have initiated an investigation that 


 would have heaped even more stress upon me, disrupted my 


 unit's mission, and ultimately destroyed my career.



 I know that many would say that a gay service member in 


 such a situation could go to a chaplain in confidentiality. I 


 have great respect for our military chaplains and for all the 


 good work that they do. But I also believe that no service 


 member should feel forced to see a chaplain as his or her 


 only option. Every service member should have the right to 


 speak freely with a commander, a trusted noncommissioned 


 officer, or a battle buddy. I assert this not only as an 


 individual Soldier, but also as an officer with extensive 


 experience as a platoon leader and company commander. When I 


 have been in these command positions, I have had Soldiers 


 share with me some very personal information about their 


 families and home lives. I was glad that these Soldiers 


 trusted me, and this bond of trust and openness enabled me to 


 give each individual the counsel or moral support that was 


 needed. But what about gay troops? They are legally deprived 


 of such a relationship with a commander, a senior 


 noncommissioned officer, or a battle buddy. This is wrong. 


 These gay troops--especially those experiencing the stress of 


 combat zone duty--deserve access to such relationships. The 


 DADT policy shackles the hands of leaders like myself and 


 prevents us from properly supporting all our troops. This 


 policy puts service members and their loved ones at risk. 


 DADT is a shameful blot on our national honor.



 I know that many are wary of a repeal of DADT. Perhaps 


 some--particularly those who oppose homosexual conduct on 


 religious grounds--see such a policy change as the equivalent 


 of governmental approval of homosexual conduct. But this is 


 not so. Let me strike an analogy. Many religious individuals 


 are opposed, on biblical grounds, to divorce and remarriage. 


 But persons who have divorced and remarried are plentiful in 


 the armed services, and many serve alongside very 


 conservative religious persons every day. Respecting 


 divorced-and-remarried persons as military professionals does 


 not mean one agrees with their personal life choices, or that 


 the government is advocating such choices. To me, the main 


 issue is that we respect personnel who serve their country 


 honorably and who act with responsibility and integrity in 


 their personal lives. For example, in the military we will 


 punish a ''deadbeat dad'' who neglects to pay his child 


 support, but we support and respect the divorced father who 


 stays committed to his parental responsibilities. I believe 


 that we need to take a comparable stance towards gay service 


 members.



 There are also some who claim that repealing DADT will 


 negatively impact morale and discipline in our armed 


 services. But I have never seen a single shred of empirical 


 evidence to support such assertions. In fact, the available 


 evidence suggests that treating gay and straight troops 


 equally has no negative impact on military forces. Consider 


 the fact that many of our key allies in current combat and 


 security operations--nations such as the United Kingdom, 


 Canada, and Australia--do not discriminate on the basis of 


 sexual orientation in their armed services. These fighting 


 forces continue to perform admirably. Furthermore, troops 


 from these and other nondiscriminatory nations live and serve 


 side by side every day with U.S. troops in war zones. On this 


 current tour, for example, I personally have shared living 


 and bathing facilities with uniformed personnel from 


 Australia, Canada, Denmark, Spain, and the United Kingdom--


 never have I seen a U.S. serviceman run shrieking from the 


 showers because he feared that he might encounter an openly 


 gay individual from one of these allied nations. Last year I 


 met an openly gay chief petty officer from the Australian 


 navy. He had served as part of a U.S.-led multinational team 


 in Iraq. He told me that not only was his presence no problem 


 for the Americans, but they decorated him with a U.S. medal 


 at the end of his tour! Surely if Americans can accept a gay 


 Australian, they can also accept gay fellow Americans. People 


 who claim that the U.S. military cannot manage a policy of 


 sexual orientation nondiscrimination are not only ignoring 


 the realities of current operations, but they are also 


 essentially saying that American service personnel are less 


 professional than those of the U.K., Canada, and other 


 nondiscriminatory nations--I consider such an assertion to be 


 a highly offensive insult.



 Of course, my argument ultimately leads to a logical--and 


 fair--question: How do we manage this change in policy? The 


 answer is simple. Hold gay service members to exactly the 


 same standards we hold straight service members. If gay 


 individuals were to commit acts of sexual harassment, or 


 engage in any other type of activity that goes contrary to 


 military order, we would discipline them appropriately--and 


 separate them from the service if necessary. This happens to 


 straight service members when necessary; I myself once had to 


 discipline a straight male noncommissioned officer for his 


 inappropriate behavior towards a junior female Soldier. This 


 NCO accepted my counsel, corrected his behavior, and 


 completed his tour of duty successfully. On the other 


 hand, those gay individuals who conduct themselves with 


 honor and dignity, and who demonstrate respect for their 


 fellow service members, would continue to do their jobs. 


 This is exactly the policy that coalition militaries, many 


 U. S. police departments, and dozens of civilian 


 corporations have been following successfully for years. 


 Are we really to believe that this course of action is 


 beyond the capability of the U.S. military?



 In fact, I believe that the demise of DADT will happen as 


 smoothly and quietly as did similar policy changes in the 


 militaries of allied nations. Gay troops who have been 


 behaving in a professional manner prior to the demise of DADT 


 are not suddenly going to begin engaging in outrageous or 


 disruptive behavior. Today's gay troops, despite the burdens 


 of DADT, are putting their lives on the line every day to 


 defend this country; many of us have been tested in Iraq, 


 Afghanistan, Somalia, and other challenging locations. If the 


 military gets rid of DADT, we will continue to do our jobs 


 and take care of our battle buddies; we and our commanders 


 will simply have a terrible burden lifted from our shoulders.



 Congressman, after more than two decades of military 


 service--at sea and on land, from the Cold War era to the 


 Global War on Terror, in joint service and multinational 


 environments--I think I know the women and men of our armed 


 forces pretty well. I can tell you that every day U. S. 


 service members overcome barriers of difference--difference 


 in race, ethnic heritage, religion, regional origin, gender, 


 socioeconomic class, and other areas. Sexual orientation is 


 just another element in this complex equation. We are able to 


 overcome all these types of difference and form cohesive 


 teams by focusing on the basics: mutual respect, a solid work 


 ethic, personal integrity, and commitment to our common 


 missions. We are also able to recognize that a person whose 


 difference may initially unsettle us may also possess a 


 critical skill, a body of knowledge, or a depth of experience 


 that we need to accomplish these common missions. Can we 


 afford to lose a fluent Arabic linguist because she is a 


 lesbian? Can we afford to discard a combat seasoned 


 infantryman because he is gay?



 I have enclosed with this letter some documentation from my 


 combat zone service. My contributions have been modest 


 compared to the heroism shown by many of my sisters and 


 brothers in arms. Still, I am proud of what I have achieved. 


 I leave it to you to look at my record and determine whether 


 or not the military would be better off if I--and, for that 


 matter, thousands of people like me--were to be involuntarily 


 dismissed from duty.



 I am an ordinary guy who grew up in New York. My dad is a 


 retired New York City cop who was deeply impacted by the 9/11 


 terrorist attacks. Like any other deployed Soldier, I call my 


 folks at least once a week, and they worry about me just like 


 the parents of any Soldier. I don't want to turn the military 


 into some sort of gay utopia. I just




 want gay Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast 


 Guardsmen--together with our loved ones--to have the sort of 


 peace of mind that our straight sisters and brothers take for 


 granted.



 Congressman Ackerman, I read on your Web site about how you 


 stood up for Soldiers who were not getting their combat zone 


 tax exemption in Iraq. So I know you are a leader who 


 believes in taking care of the troops. Sir, I believe that 


 now is the time to give troops like me relief from the 


 injustice of ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' If and when this 


 issue comes up for debate, and even for a vote, in Congress, 


 I respectfully ask you to remember all the gay military 


 personnel who are right now risking our lives to defend the 


 United States and its values. If you have any questions or 


 comments about anything I have written, you may contact me 


 via e-mail. And please feel free to share this letter and its 


 enclosures, including my contact information, with any 


 individuals or organizations whom you deem appropriate.





 Sincerely, ------.
