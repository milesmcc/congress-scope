Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
might consume.

As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in consideration of H.R. 625, 
which names the postal facility in Baldwin Park, California, after 
Atanacio Haro-Marin.

H.R. 625, which was introduced by Representative Hilda Solis on 
January 22, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on March 
29, 2007 by voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by the 
52 members, has the support of the entire California congressional 
delegation. Army Sergeant Atanacio Haro-Marin, age 27, of Baldwin Park, 
California, was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery 
Regiment, Fort Hood, Texas. He was killed while manning the checkpoint 
when his unit came under attack from gunfire and rocket-propelled 
grenades south of Balad, Iraq on June 3, 2003.

Sergeant Marin was born in Momax, Mexico, and lived there with his 
mother while his father worked in California picking fruit and doing 
construction jobs to support seven children. The family reunited in Los 
Angeles when Sergeant Marin was 2, and they later moved to suburban 
Baldwin Park. He will be remembered as a proud and courageous soldier 
who was living out a long-held dream of serving in the U.S. military.

Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague for seeking to honor the 
memory, legacy, and contributions of Atanacio Haro-Marin, and urge 
swift passage of this bill.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.
