Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, this Democratic Congress has a strong 
record of delivering on our promise to the American people and 
providing real and meaningful change. And we have done so in a fiscally 
responsible way, instituting pay-as-you-go, deficit reduction 
discipline.

One area where we have made real progress for the American people is 
by supporting the men and women who serve our Nation in the Armed 
Forces. Under Democratic control, this House provided substantially 
more than the President requested for the new M-


RAP vehicles proven to save lives in Iraq. We voted to give our troops 
a pay raise that the President called ''unnecessary.'' We strengthened 
military health care with the Wounded Warriors Act to clean up the 
inadequate care of wounded soldiers at Walter Reed and other 
facilities. And the Democratic House voted to provide the largest 
increase in funding for VA health care in the history of this country.

Mr. Speaker, these investments that support our veterans and troops 
overseas are just a few examples of how our Democratic Congress is 
taking America in a new direction.
