`Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado â€” 21 July 2010`

Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a 
hero: United States Marine Corps Corporal Larry D. Harris, Jr., of 
Thornton, Colorado.

Corporal Harris, a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, 
graduated in 2003 from Boulder High School where he played football and 
ran track. He loved being an infantry marine on the front lines.

Corporal Larry Harris displayed heroism and service to others both 
overseas and at home. He was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps 
Achievement Medal for helping civilians severely injured in an 
automobile accident near Camp Pendleton.

On July 1, 2010, while on patrol in Helmand province in Afghanistan, 
another marine was shot in the leg. Picking up his fellow wounded 
marine to


carry him to safety, Corporal Harris tripped an explosive device, 
absorbing the blast. Though he died in the explosion, his effort saved 
the life of the wounded marine.

Corporal Harris is a shining example of the Marine Corps' service and 
sacrifice. As a Marine Corps veteran, my deepest sympathies go out to 
his family and to all who knew him.
