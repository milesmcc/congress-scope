# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Mrs. SCHMIDT. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight after another long day 
out of disappointment--disappointed that we are not having a real 
debate about how we win in Iraq. We have spent countless hours in what 
is little more than political theater.

This body is scheduled to meet 145 days this year. Just to open our 
doors, we spend over $8 million for each legislative day. This debate 
will cost some $30 million, yet it will yield nothing but a partisan 
vote on a nonbinding resolution after literally hundreds of speeches 
designed to do no more than charge up one's own political base.

I am deeply disappointed. The people expect more from us. They expect 
solutions, not grandstanding. They expect both parties to work 
together. There will be no victory when our votes are tallied. We will 
have every problem we began with, but be even further apart 
politically.

Tonight, I believe we embarrass ourselves before our brave men and 
women in uniform, before the American people and before our enemies.
