Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I will 
object. I say to my friend from Oregon, I understand this is the hate 
crimes bill. I appreciate his passion and commitment on this issue. 
There is no one more respected in the Senate who has had the situation 
of my distinguished friend from Oregon. But we are on the Defense bill. 
We have to move forward with the amendments. We have to get it done. We 
have both Iraq as well as the impending 1st of October date staring us 
in the face. At this time I object to the request by the Senator from 
Oregon.
