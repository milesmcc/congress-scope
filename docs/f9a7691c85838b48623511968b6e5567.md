Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, this is first-year law school discussion. 
If you read the amendment offered by the gentlelady, it makes reference 
to 1212(a)(1)(a)(4). It applies only to this. I read that section: 
''Any security agreement, arrangement, or assurance that obligates the 
United States to respond to internal or external threats against 
Iraq.'' That doesn't say a thing, not a blooming thing about Status of 
Forces Agreement. So that is what we are talking about. That is why a 
treaty is required or a consent of Congress.
