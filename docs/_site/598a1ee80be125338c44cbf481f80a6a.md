Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would tell my friend where 
that trillion-dollar deficit came from is the $1 trillion combined in 
Afghanistan and Iraq that we spent that's off budget, never accounted 
for, borrowed and spent by the Republicans in the majority.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from 
Wisconsin, my good friend, the chairman of the Committee on 
Appropriations, David Obey.
