Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, recently, tens of thousands of 
Americans expressed their opposition to out-of-control government 
spending by participating in hundreds of TEA party protests around the 
country on Tax Day.

The national media responded by ignoring, dismissing, or blatantly 
ridiculing the protests.

There was no mention of the TEA parties the next day on the front 
pages of the Washington Post or New York Times, even though the Times 
found space on its front page for a story about protests in 
Afghanistan.

In contrast, the media covered liberal protests during President 
Bush's term frequently--and without criticism.

A Washington Times editorial argued that the media's handling of the 
TEA party protests went a step beyond bias. ''Forget media bias,'' the 
Times wrote. ''The liberal press judges stories before investigating 
them. That's prejudice.''

Whether it's due to bias or prejudice, the national media failed to 
cover Americans' widespread resistance to big government. And that's 
the real story.
