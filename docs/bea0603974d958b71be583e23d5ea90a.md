Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, due to external circumstances, I was 
unable to promptly return to House Chambers and I missed the following 
vote on Thursday, June 19, 2008. I would have voted as follows: H.R. 
2764, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, rollcall vote 431, 
Agreeing to Senate Amendment to House Amendment No.1: ''no.''

I would have voted ''no'' on this amendment which provides $165.4 
billion in funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan because this 
amendment contained no benchmarks or timelines for redeploying our 
troops out of Iraq responsibly, safe, and soon.
