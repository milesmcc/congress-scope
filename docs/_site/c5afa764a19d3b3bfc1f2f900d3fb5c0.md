`Mr. HAGEL â€” 14 December 2007`

---

 Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise to express my sympathy over 
the loss of Michael Doheny of Nebraska. Michael, a civilian contractor, 
died in Iraq on December 9 when an improvised explosive device struck 
his convoy vehicle. He was 35 years old.

Michael was raised in Broken Bow, NE, and graduated from Broken Bow 
High School in 1996. He joined the Marine Corps after high school, 
where he served 8 years and achieved the rank of sergeant. In 2005, 
Michael left the military and began work as a civilian contractor for 
SOC-SMG, providing security at military bases and other installations. 
He was serving his third tour of duty as a civilian contractor in Iraq 
when he was killed.

All of Nebraska is proud of Michael's service to our country, as well 
as the thousands of brave men and women serving in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

Michael is remembered as a devoted husband, son, and brother. In 
addition to his wife Melissa, he is survived by his mother, Kathy 
Kugler; two brothers, Marine Sgt. Robert Kugler and John Doheny; and 
sister Amy Ritchie.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Michael 
Doheny.
