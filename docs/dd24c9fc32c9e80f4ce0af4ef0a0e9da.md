Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4156, the 
Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act.

The Iraq war is a failure and it's time for our troops to come home.

This bill calls for a responsible redeployment and provides for the 
checks and balances Congress is authorized to impose.

The administration does not have blanket authority and America does 
not have a bottomless checking account.

The President's policy in Iraq has been a complete failure, and 
Americans are calling for this war to end.

Our troops are now trapped in the middle of someone else's civil war.

Our military presence in Iraq is not making our country any safer.

Instead, this war has taken the lives of over 3,850 soldiers, 
including 13 brave young men from my District alone.

From Rialto, 37-year-old Staff Sergeant Jorge A. Molina was deployed 
in Iraq and died in hostile fire in the Anbar province.

From Rialto, 20-year-old, Specialist Luis D. Santos was deployed in 
Iraq and died of injuries sustained when a makeshift bomb exploded near 
his Humvee during combat operations in Buritz.

From Rialto, 22-year-old, Corporal Victor A. Garcia was deployed in 
Iraq and died by small arms fire in Baghdad.

From Bloomington, 25-year-old, Corporal Joseph A. Blanco was deployed 
in Iraq and died by small arms fire in Taji after sustaining injuries 
from a makeshift bomb.

From Fontana, 19-year-old Lance Corporal Fernando S. Tamayo was 
deployed in Iraq and died while conducting combat operations in Anbar 
Province.

From Fontana, 24-year-old Sergeant Bryan A. Brewster was deployed in 
Afghanistan and died after his helicopter crashed during combat 
operations in Afghanistan.

From San Bernardino, 22-year-old Corporal Nicanor Alvarez was 
deployed in Iraq and died in the line of fire in the Anbar province.

From San Bernardino, 19-year-old Petty Officer Alex Oceguera was 
deployed in Afghanistan, and died when a makeshift bomb detonated near 
his vehicle in Wygal Valley, Afghanistan.


From San Bernardino, 24-year-old Corporal Sean Grilley was deployed 
in Iraq, and died after being fired on by Iraqis during operations in 
Karbala.

From San Bernardino, 24-year-old Specialist Timothy D. Watkins was 
deployed in Iraq, and died when a makeshift bomb exploded near his 
vehicle during operations in Ar Ramadi.

From Ontario, 21-year-old Specialist Jose R. Perez was deployed in 
Iraq, and died by enemy small arms fire in Ramadi.

From Ontario, 31-year-old Sergeant First Class Rudy A. Salcido was 
deployed in Iraq, and died when an improvised explosive device 
detonated near his convey vehicle in Baghdad.

These are the true faces of the war. My deepest prayers go out to 
their families.

These soldiers are the reason why I am so adamant about bringing our 
troops back home, and why we must support this bill.

The President's failed policies on the Iraqi war effort must end. We 
are listening to America's concerns and will not stand by and watch 
this continue.

We need to bring back our loved ones and put our families here at 
home first.

It's time for America to put her priorities in order.

This Nation is in debt, but not because of domestic spending.

President Bush refuses to sign bills to pay for schools, children's 
health care, and to protect our workers.

However, he comes to us asking for another $200 billion to continue 
funding the Iraq war.

With just one week's worth of funding for the war, my District would 
never again face a shortage of teachers, of nurses, or of police 
officers.

As a veteran, I voted against this war in 2002 because no one could 
convince me why we had to be there in the first place.

The President believes Iraq is making our country safer.

The truth is, it is has put us at greater risk.

Our military is stretched so thin that we are at risk of not being 
prepared for any future emergencies.
