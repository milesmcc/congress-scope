Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as Members know, we are currently 
debating the Transportation and Housing appropriations bill that funds 
incredibly important infrastructure, from airports to highways to 
bridges to housing programs. The majority leader has instructed us to 
finish this bill by tonight. We have a number of amendments before us 
that we need to work through. Therefore, I will object, and I remind 
all Senators that next week, in just a few short days, we will be 
moving to the Defense authorization bill and a debate on Iraq with 
numerous opportunities for Senators to bring forward issues relating to 
that. So I will object at this time.
