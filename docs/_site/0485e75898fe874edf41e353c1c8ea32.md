`Mr. LEVIN â€” 11 July 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is ample evidence that 4 years of war 
has stressed our Armed Forces to the breaking point. Our Army and 
Marine Corps are stretched dangerously thin. They are wearing out. 
Earlier this year, we watched as they scrambled and pulled together the 
personnel, equipment, and training to meet the surge of additional 
forces to Iraq. They will continue to struggle to sustain this higher 
surge force level if it extends beyond this fall.

Unit rotations into and out of an overseas mission has been a fixture 
of U.S. military operations for many years. However, unit-rotation 
schemes have significant strategic risks, and risks are increased when 
deployed force levels spike or drop as our military strategy changes in 
the political or security environment, such as was done for past 
elections or the recent surge.

Short-notice deployment accelerations and extensions are inherently 
risky and complicate unit preparation and operations on the ground. 
Risks increase when we do not have sufficient ground forces overall to 
accomplish what we are asking them to do and still allow time for 
nondeployed units and individuals to fully recover from their last or 
prepare for their next deployment.

Multiple deployments with insufficient dwell time contribute to 
several problems among our troops: Insufficient dwell time increases 
operational risk as troops and units deploy without the time necessary 
to fully man, equip, and train before they leave their home station. 
Insufficient dwell time between rotations contributes to the retention 
problems we are seeing, especially among midgrade officers and 
sergeants. Insufficient time between rotations creates higher rates of 
mental health issues among troops with multiple and extended 
deployments. Insufficient dwell time puts much higher stress on our 
military families, resulting in higher than normal levels of divorce or 
abuse.

Last January, the Secretary of Defense announced a new approach to 
unit rotation. Among our Active component forces, he wanted to 
immediately achieve a minimum 1-to-1 deployed to at home or dwell time, 
on the way to achieving a goal of 1-to-2 or greater dwell time. Our 
Guard and Reserve forces would deploy for no longer than 12 months from 
start to finish, with a goal of no less than 5 years between 
deployments.

Well, the Webb amendment reflects those policy goals. The Webb 
amendment mandates that for each day deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, 
an Active-Duty servicemember will spend 1 day at home, and it mandates 
that our Guard and Reserves get a minimum of 3 years between 
deployments. It is essential that as we vote we understand that the 
amendment provides waiver authorities to the President and service 
chiefs to ensure the flexibility to respond to any emergency the Nation 
may face in the future, and those decisions are left to the President.

Mr. President, there is precedent for the Webb amendment. Congress 
took action in 1999 to relieve some of the deployment burden our forces 
were facing at that time and to drive the Department of Defense to a 
more precise management system that would take better care of troops 
and their families. It is true that Congress has the power of the 
purse, but under that same Constitution, we also have the power to 
regulate the Armed Forces by law, and that is what the Webb amendment 
seeks to do.

Congress established in law an annual deployment threshold for Active 
and Reserve forces above which servicemembers are entitled to special 
pay. We put that in law as part of our constitutional authority to 
regulate the Army and the Navy. The Secretary of Defense exercised his 
national security waiver authority of that requirement right after 9/
11. It is not unusual to


have a waiver authority in law. It is not unusual for the executive to 
use that waiver authority, as they have done before.

Due to the deployment management standards of this earlier 
legislation, the services have in place the systems necessary to plan 
and execute the requirements of this amendment, and so it has served 
its purpose, and this one will as well.

It is a very useful amendment. The Defense Department will have to 
make earlier strategic and operational decisions, which will allow 
greater precision in planning unit and individual rotations, and that 
will result in greater predictability and stability for our troops and 
their families.

The Webb amendment promotes the health of our troops, ensuring time 
for post-deployment evaluation and recovery. The Webb amendment also 
promotes readiness, ensuring that units and personnel have the time--
the most precious of resources--to man, equip, and train for any future 
mission.

I hope the Senate will adopt the Webb amendment. It will be a useful 
contribution to the readiness and well-being of our Armed Forces.

I yield the floor.
