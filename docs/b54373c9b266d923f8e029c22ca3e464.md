Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and of the 
conference report.

I was honored to serve on the conference committee. It was a good 
team effort. And as anyone in team sports knows, it takes a good 
offense and a good defense to make a good team. This bill takes 
important steps toward building a good defense, and good defense today 
is more important than ever because our offense has miscarried so 
badly.

There we were pursuing Osama bin Laden literally to the ends of the 
Earth, to Tora Bora, when this administration steered us off that 
course and into the cul-de-sac of Iraq.

This bill will build a better defense because we need it more than 
ever. We need this bill not just as legislation but as a reminder to 
carry forth with the oversight that this Congress has traditionally 
exerted.

The jurisdiction of my subcommittee and of the Homeland Security 
Committee over the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is more crucial 
than ever as that body chooses technologies to protect this Nation 
going forward.

Eternal vigilance is the call for the day, and I am committed to 
exerting that vigilance going forward from this day.
