Mr. MURTHA. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, Members of the House, this is the largest 
appropriations bill that we have ever handled. It was completely 
bipartisan. We never did anything without working together. It is 
basically the same bill we voted on before it went to the Senate but 
with a few minor changes. I am pleased to say that we made some 
conciliatory changes with the White House and also with the Senate. 
This, as a matter of fact, is $625 billion. The House passed $636 
billion. It pays for first-class medical care for military personnel.

I have to say I don't usually talk on any one thing, but having been 
out at Bethesda in intensive care for 2 days, I have to endorse the 
money that we have spent on the care at Bethesda. They did a marvelous 
job, and I am so pleased about the way the money is being handled out 
there.

Medical research, of course, the committee under my leadership and 
under the leadership of Jerry Lewis and Bill Young, has always been in 
the forefront. There are peer-reviewed programs, which have turned out 
to be as good as any programs you will find any place. We are 
supporting military families, operations and maintenance, civilian 
workforce, and insourcing. We are trying to reduce the contractors, and 
we are struggling in doing that. The inspector of general oversight, we 
worked at that for 2 or 3 years. This bill includes the MRAP program 
and $526 million for situational awareness.

In other words, this is as good a bill as we could come up with given 
the amount of money that was apportioned to us.

The Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Appropriations Bill puts troops first, 
ensuring their readiness, providing them with first class weapons and 
equipment, and ensuring the availability of care and support for their 
families.

The bill makes critical investments in the health, well-being and 
readiness of our armed forces; addressing issues raised by service 
members, their families, and Department of Defense officials in 
testimony before the Congress, and discovered through visits to 
military bases across the United States and overseas. The bill also 
reins in the use of contractors and begins to return inherently 
governmental functions to Department of Defense personnel.

For the first time since the beginning of operations in Iraq, this 
bill includes funding for Overseas Contingency Operations in 
Afghanistan and Iraq for the upcoming fiscal year; providing $128.3 
billion to support current operations, and to meet the needs of our 
troops in the field and their families here at home. The bill does not 
address the President's new Afghanistan security strategy because the 
Administration has yet to request funding for that initiative.
