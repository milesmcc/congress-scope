Mr. KAGEN. In the beginning in the formation of the United States, we 
had an outside observer come over here, Alexis de Tocqueville. And de 
Tocqueville observed that with our Republic, it would be very difficult 
to get this country, this Nation, to go to war. But once involved in a 
war, it would be very difficult to stop it. And I think that MO, that 
picture, that frame is in part what is happening here. Now that we are 
involved in a ground game in other areas of the world, it's very 
difficult for our Republic to pull back.

I would like now to welcome to the floor Congressman McGovern from 
the State of Massachusetts. And I thank you for joining us on this 
discussion on Afghanistan and Pakistan and where do we go from here.
