Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to 
stand with those who want a change. I am proud to fight for 
accountability in our foreign policy and proud to fight until our brave 
veterans get the benefits that they deserve.

A year ago, I called on my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to 
stand ready for change. I renew that same call today. Neither our 
troops nor our veterans can wait for us to change our foreign policy in 
Iraq, not until next year's sixth anniversary, or the seventh 
anniversary, or the tenth.
