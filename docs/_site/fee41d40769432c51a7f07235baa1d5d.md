Mr. GILCHREST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

I want to say as a marine combat veteran 40 years ago in Vietnam, I 
sometimes wonder, as I look around this Chamber, which Members would I 
follow into combat. Those of you who are sitting here now, those of you 
who are sitting here now, are you competent enough to lead soldiers 
into this very difficult human endeavor?

The troops are doing a stunningly competent job and they continue to 
do so. Are we as Members of this House doing a stunningly competent job 
to be thoroughly informed about the problems of the war in Iraq and the 
Middle East?

Part of our competence must be to understand the psychological and 
physical stress our soldiers in real combat must endure. Experience in 
combat, those of us who have been there, know how valuable that is to 
one soldier and the next soldier. But we as policymakers must come up 
with a policy, and we weigh that experience that is necessary with the 
physical and psychological endurance of those soldiers that is 
necessary.

Respecting the troops means we are responsible and competent in 
developing a policy that is worthy of those young men and women. I urge 
support for this legislation.
