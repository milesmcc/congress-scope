Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentleman from New York.

The Israel amendment recognizes that we have a responsibility to the 
Iraqis who by helping us have put a bull's eye on their back. The 
interpreters every single day are in immense jeopardy. They have many 
people who, if their identity is determined, will kill them.

But as aggressive as Mr. Israel is in promoting this amendment, he is 
really the second-most aggressive advocate. The most aggressive are our 
soldiers, who have benefited day in and day out from the services of 
people they have come to call their brothers. They want us to stand up 
for the people who have stood up for them.

And do they need a job when they come here? Of course they do. This 
is about doing work so that they can maintain body and soul. It is also 
about them having work that can continue to help our men and women in 
uniform.
