`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 8 November 2007`

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Madam Chairman, I want to thank you for allowing 
me to have 3 minutes.

Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the rule, and I encourage all of the 
Members to do so. As a sitting 5-year member on the Armed Services 
Committee, having an opportunity to look not only over this bill but 
being a part of the voting for Defense bills or Defense appropriations 
bills in the past, I am proud of it.

We have the responsibility here in Congress not only to make sure 
they


have up-armor, bullets, what have you, meals, the things they need in 
the field, but we also have to make sure that their families are okay 
too. I asked for a couple of minutes because I couldn't help but 
witness the passion that the whip had when he came to the floor about 
making sure that military families have the same opportunities as those 
who are not in the military.

I think it's important for us to realize, Members, that there are 
some individuals that are privileged, there are some people that have 
the opportunity to be with their sons and daughters, but we also have 
people who are in harm's way. In a time of war, we have to make sure 
that life doesn't stop for those families that are left behind.

I just want to add, so that we start looking at this issue, not to 
make it a debate, because it was debated earlier today, but this bill 
is doing some of the great things as it relates to the MRAP vehicles we 
have in Iraq. I was just in Fallujah a couple of months ago. It was my 
third trip to Iraq. I am proud to see some of the work that is starting 
to take place there as it relates to the equipment getting to the men 
and women. But I can say that this issue of making sure that families 
have what they need when we have men and women in harm's way is not a 
new issue.

I can tell you a former Member of the House, Mr. DeLay, had a $1 
million FY03 Labor-HHS appropriations to the First Tee program, and 
these are for civilians. The program also received $2 million in FY04 
Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and $1 million in the State-Justice 
appropriations bill. I think it's important that Members realize that 
when we look at these military families, they have to have the same 
kind of attention and appreciation that we give our men and women in 
harm's way.

I have my son here on the floor with me today; he is out of school. 
As Members know, we play golf together. But, guess what? I am here to 
play golf with him. The First Tee program has instructors to be able to 
work with young people when their mothers or their fathers are not 
there to play that role. So let's make sure that we do the right thing.

Madam Chairman, I want to thank you for bringing the rule to the 
floor. I want to thank those who are in support of the rule, but I 
think it's very, very important that I expect to vote in an affirmative 
for the rule, to make sure that we do for military families what we do 
for men and women in harm's way.
