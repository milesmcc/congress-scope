`Mr. FEINGOLD â€” 3 October 2007`

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have expressed 
serious concerns about the war in Iraq. I would say now is the time to 
put those concerns into action. We have the power and the 
responsibility to end a war that is hurting our troops, our fiscal 
situation, and our national security.

By voting for the Feingold-Reid amendment today, we can safely 
redeploy our troops from Iraq. I understand the bill's managers would 
rather not address Iraq on their bill. That is their decision. But I 
note this amendment has the strong support of the Democratic 
leadership. So I thank Senator Reid for his support and leadership.

I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid amendment.

Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.
