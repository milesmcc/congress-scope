`Mr. NELSON of Florida â€” 22 December 2010`

---


Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I pay tribute during this 
holiday season to the men and women serving our Nation so nobly across 
the globe. As we mark the 10th year our Nation has been engaged in 
combat, we should all be reminded of the extraordinary sacrifice of our 
soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen.

As we gather with our loved ones, we must not forget those 
servicemembers who cannot be with their families and friends this 
holiday season. We honor these men and women risk their lives to 
protect our freedom and way of life. The one constant in this uncertain 
time is the heroism of people who so willingly fight for freedom. The 
strength of our Nation is built on their devotion and sacrifice.













 Specialist Kelly J. Mixon


I rise today to honor the fallen, like Army SPC Kelly J. Mixon of 
Yulee, FL, who was killed by an improvised explosive device in 
Afghanistan on December 8. Specialist Mixon would be 24 years old on 
Christmas Eve. Sadly, he will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery 
on December 29.

To the many men and women who have given the last measure of freedom, 
our country will remember your bravery and patriotism. To the families 
of these fallen servicemembers, we can never express enough gratitude 
for the sacrifice you must bear. On behalf of the people of Florida and 
our Nation, our prayers are with you.
