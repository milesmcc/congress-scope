`Mr. INOUYE â€” 18 June 2009`

Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference 
agreement on H.R. 2346, the supplemental appropriations bill.

The compromise agreement, which has been worked out in a full and 
open conference between the two Houses, represents the hard work of our 
conferees.

As has long been the tradition of the Appropriations Committee the 
compromise package before the Senate reflects the deliberations of our 
twelve


subcommittees. Each subcommittee has items in this measure and I am 
pleased to note that all of our subcommittees were able to reach 
agreement with their House counterparts.

As such, the bill before us represents a balanced compromise between 
the issues and funding recommended by the House and by the Senate.

As in any compromise neither body, nor individual Member, received 
everything he or she sought.

The House has agreed to support funding for the International 
Monetary Fund and the Senate has agreed to compromise language on how 
we deal with the detainees at Guantanamo. But, it is a fair compromise 
which I believe all Members should support.

At $105.9 billion, the conference agreement is $14.6 billion above 
the amount recommended by the Senate. However, it is important to point 
out to my Senate colleagues that nearly half of this increase 
represents additional funding for swine flu. This funding was included 
in response to a budget amendment submitted by the administration 
following Senate passage of this bill.

The managers of our Labor HHS subcommittees have responded to the 
potential need for additional swine flu resources by providing more 
than $7 billion in funding, of which nearly $6 billion is contingent 
upon the administration submitting additional requests for funds. We 
have been advised that funding may be required this summer to prepare 
for an outbreak next fall in the United States if the virus mutates 
over the next few months.

If that occurs, the American public can be assured that we will be 
ready. I can also promise my colleagues that our Labor-HHS subcommittee 
will be monitoring the flu virus and closely watching the 
administration's efforts to respond to this potential crisis.

Regarding the remaining increase above the Senate bill, the 
conference agreement funding levels are between the amounts recommended 
by the two bodies.

The bill includes the funding level sought by the House for the 
Department of State and ''splits the difference'' in the amount 
recommended by both bodies for defense and military construction.

One provision of note that was deleted from the measure relates to 
the public release of photographs of detainees. The Senate agreed to 
drop this provision only after the President sent a letter to Chairman 
Obey and myself assuring us that he would not release the photographs 
in question.

While many of us support the intent of this amendment, it was clear 
that including the amendment would jeopardize passage of the bill in 
the House. That result would not have been an acceptable outcome.

Mr. President, this is a fair compromise and one which is worthy of 
the support of every Member of the Senate.

I understand that there may be one or two items that not all Members 
agree with, but I would remind my colleagues that this is a must pass 
bill. The funding in this bill is critical to the Defense Department in 
continuing to support our servicemen and women fighting in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

I would point out that if we cannot pass this bill, we will shortly 
run out of funds to pay our service members and to ensure funds are 
available to support the readiness of all our forces, not just those 
serving in Southwest Asia.

I want to thank my vice chairman for his counsel and support as we 
have worked through several difficult issues.

We have forged this agreement together. I would note that there were 
30 Senate conferees on this measure and 27 signed the conference 
agreement.

Finally, I wish to thank all of our subcommittee chairmen and ranking 
members and their staffs for their hard work. This conference agreement 
would not have been possible without their efforts.

I yield the floor.
