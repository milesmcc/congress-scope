Mr. REID. Madam President, we have so much to do the next 2 weeks. As 
indicated with what is going on here today, we have to do our very best 
to complete WRDA. We have the most important supplemental to take care 
of the funding of the operations in Iraq and other things. Senator 
McConnell and I have spoken today about how to get from here to there. 
We do not have that totally resolved yet, but we have moved the ball 
down the road. We also have a budget conference to complete. That has 
not been done yet. And we have immigration.

So, Madam President, I want this to be the first notice--and we have 
done very well. We have not had to work many Fridays; certainly in the 
afternoons we have not had to. We have had a number of free Mondays, 
and we have had only one Saturday we have worked all year. But everyone 
should be on notice the next two weekends and the next few days and 
certainly next week, including Monday, people should understand--and 
people, if they have arrangements they have made, if they have things 
to do for which they cannot be here until later Monday, change that 
because we have to have votes--unless something comes up we do not 
understand--Monday morning. We have too much to do. We must complete 
the items I have talked about before we leave for our Memorial Day 
recess or we will have to delay that recess.
