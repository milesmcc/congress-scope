Ms. SHEA-PORTER. We are at the anniversary of the beginning of the 
war in Iraq. Things are not going well. Our troops are strained. Our 
generals are speaking to the President of the United States, who does 
not seem to be listening. I would like to read this to the President of 
the United States on this day.

General Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked 
last month by a House panel whether he was comfortable with the 
preparedness of Army units in the United States, he stated simply: 
''No, I am not comfortable.'' Mr. President, that is one of your 
generals. General Peter Schoomaker, Army Chief of Staff, testified 
before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday: ''We have a 
strategy right now that is outstripping the means to execute it.'' Mr. 
President, that is one of your generals.

The Army Vice Chief of Staff, General Richard Cody, described as


''stark'' the level of readiness of Army units in the United States 
which would be called on if another war breaks out. The readiness 
continues to decline of our next-to-deploy forces, Cody told the House 
Armed Services Committee Readiness Panel last week.

Mr. President, hear your generals and end this war now.
