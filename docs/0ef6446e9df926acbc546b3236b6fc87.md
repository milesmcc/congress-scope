`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 28 March 2007`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman 
Hunter. I appreciate your service here in Congress, and I appreciate 
you being the parent of a veteran who has served in Iraq.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded 
Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, a bipartisan bill authored by Chairman 
Ike Skelton.

Our men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces deserve the best medical 
care we can provide. As a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army 
National Guard, with four sons currently serving in the military, I was 
greatly concerned when learning of the inadequate living conditions our 
Nation's wounded veterans have been made to endure at Walter Reed 
Medical Center.

My eldest son served for a year in Iraq and came under enemy fire 
twice. Had he been injured, I would have expected him to receive top-
notch health care which should be provided to every soldier.

While Walter Reed is renowned as a world-class facility, recent 
management neglected to provide adequate care. We have the best 
military medicine in world history, saving more lives than ever before 
and providing for the maximum recovery for patients.

I know firsthand from Major David Rozelle of the successes at Walter 
Reed Army Hospital for our amputees, where dedicated staff members are 
so caringly effective helping our troops recover. In fact, Major 
Rozelle wrote an excellent book, ''Back in Action,'' the inspiring true 
story of the first amputee to return to active command in Iraq.



I am pleased Congress is coming together to improve the paperwork 
complications and ensure our military medical system remains the best 
there is. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and provide 
America's brave, injured warriors the care they so deserve.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
