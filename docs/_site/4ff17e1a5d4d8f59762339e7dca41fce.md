Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Canada is the largest crude oil supplier to the 
United States. About half of that crude is derived from what is called 
oil sands. Also, the military wants to buy Canadian ''unconventional 
fuels'' instead of buying fuel from rogue dictators. The Air Force 
wants to use Canadian ''coal to liquid fuel'' and turn it into jet 
fuel.

But the nonenergy bill passed by Congress prohibits such purchases 
because of absurd environmental restrictions.

Now, not only is it harder for Americans to obtain affordable 
gasoline, our military is at risk of having a fuel shortage to carry 
out its mission in Iraq and Afghanistan.

This Nation is at war. Our troops need fuel. The latest congressional 
attempt to hurt the military as a way of appeasing environmental fear 
mongers could result in what happened to General George Patton in World 
War II. On August 31, 1944, General Patton was charging toward Germany 
and just outside of Metz, France, his tanks ran out of gas because 
bureaucrats here in the United States denied him fuel.

So unless Congress acts, our troops may be charging into battle 
riding cavalry horses, while our tanks and planes rust and gather dust 
because they are out of gas.

And that's just the way it is.
