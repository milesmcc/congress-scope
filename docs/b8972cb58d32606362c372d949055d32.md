Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a great 
American family, and a fallen hero and his brother. On July 5, 2010, 
Combat Medic SPC Jerod Heath Osborne of Royce, Texas, of the 4/73 82nd 
Airborne, died during an IED explosion in Afghanistan. In his short 
life he was a combat medic, an Angel on the Battlefield, the ones who 
rush in while all around the face of hell is going on. The lives that 
he has saved in his brief but great life will be measured in the 
future, with children and heroes that he has saved. His brother SSG 
Wautash Grillett of the 10th Mountain Div. 1st Combat Team 2nd Batt. 
22nd Infantry, on September 21 of that same year almost died in a 
mortar attack and is currently fighting to save his leg. This family, 
throughout the generations, has served our nation in the Armed Forces. 
As recently as the Vietnam war, their uncle James Carter gave his life 
in the name of freedom. The very bed of our Nation's freedom is built 
upon selfless families, our prayers and thoughts go out to them. SGG 
Grillett has said that his brother Jerod always wanted to be just like 
him, but now he wants to be like his brother.
