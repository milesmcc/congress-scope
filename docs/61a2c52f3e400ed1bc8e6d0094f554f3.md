Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. I want to commend Mr. Buyer for offering this 
amendment.

Without this amendment, the VA would actually be reducing at the very 
worst time the number of vocational rehab employees. We ought to be 
increasing those numbers, and that's what we will be doing with this, 
particularly given a lot of our troops coming back from Iraq and 
Afghanistan are having difficult times finding jobs. They need this 
support.

The VA gets a lot of things right, but I don't think they got this 
part of their budget right. And I thank the gentleman for correcting 
it, and it's a privilege to support his amendment.
