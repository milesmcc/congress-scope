Mr. SHAYS. Just to point out to him that what you're encountering is 
significant. When the Iraqis say to us, be patient, give us more time, 
what I encountered early on was they were constantly blaming the other 
groups. The Shiias would blame the Sunnis, the Sunnis would blame the 
Kurds, and so on. But what they're starting to do is they're trying to 
say, we're trying to work out our differences; give us more time to 
work together. And that's a significant change.

I likened this to a sixth-grade dance when they first started out. 
They didn't know how to interact with each other. But they're starting 
to learn how to interact. They're starting to be defensive of Iraq and 
speaking more with one voice; and I think it's not an insignificant 
event that's taking place.
