Mr. ALEXANDER. Earlier today the assistant Democratic leader, who is 
now presiding, delivered some eloquent remarks about the murders at 
Fort Hood. I believe there were two soldiers from Illinois who were 
there. One was from Tennessee, from Mountain City, TN, which is a 
beautiful little part of our State, way up in the northeastern corner 
near Virginia. Some people have said it looks like Switzerland and that 
the people there talk in Elizabethan phrases and tones.

SPC Frederick Greene, according to an article in the Washington Post:




 . . . was a Tennessee native so quiet and laid back that he 


 earned the nickname ''Silent Soldier'' while stationed at 


 Fort Hood preparing to go overseas.



 He hoped to spend the months before his deployment to 


 Afghanistan with his wife of less than 2 years. She had made 


 arrangements to leave their home in Mountain City, TN, next 


 week and move to Fort Hood until January, when Greene was to 


 ship out.



 Instead, [they] are planning his burial in the northeast 


 corner of the state where he grew up.


This is what Specialist Greene's family had to say about him, and I 
think it speaks as eloquently about his life and service to our country 
as anything could. In their words:




 Fred was a loved and loving son, husband and father, and 


 often acted as the protector of his family.



 Even before joining the Army, he exemplified the Army 


 values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, 


 integrity and personal courage. Many of his fellow soldiers 


 told us he was the quiet professional of the unit, never 


 complaining about a job, and often volunteering when needed. 


 Our family is grateful for the thoughts and prayers from 


 people around the country. We would like to ask for privacy 


 during this emotional time because Fred, too, was a very 


 private person.


We will honor the request for privacy of the family, but we will also 
honor Fred Greene for his service to our country.

Speaking just for myself, but I am sure most Tennesseans, most 
Americans, feel the same way--for 8 years now, tens of thousands of men 
and women from Tennessee have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan to keep 
terrorism from spreading here.

It is tragic enough when any one of them is wounded or killed in that 
fight; it is beyond belief when one of them is wounded or killed at 
home in a terrorist act at Fort Hood. That is hard for us to accept. 
But in accepting it and asking questions that we inevitably must ask 
about how this could have happened, we certainly can honor each of 
those who were killed, each of those who were wounded.

We can respect their service, and I especially want to show my 
respect for the family of SPC Frederick Greene and for his service.

I ask unanimous consent to have printed following the remarks I just 
made a brief article from the Washington Post and an article from the 
Johnson City, TN, Press of Tuesday, November 10.
