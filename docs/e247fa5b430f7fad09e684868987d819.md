Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, Petty Officer Bruckenthal and two Navy petty officers 
were killed during a coordinated suicide attack on the oil platforms 
off the coast of Iraq. These men offered what President Lincoln 
referred to as ''the last full measure of devotion'' for their country.
