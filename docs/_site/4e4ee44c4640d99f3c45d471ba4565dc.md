Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to offer my support for 
the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.

Last year, under the leadership of the President and his party, 
Congress failed to pass a budget resolution. The result was a failed 
budget process from start to finish, and Congress adjourned without 
passing 10 of 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2007.

Under Democratic leadership, the Senate passed a continuing 
resolution that funded fiscal year 2007 Government programs and sent an 
emergency supplemental appropriations bill to the President to give our 
troops over $95 billion in vital support.

I was disappointed that the President chose to veto the 
Appropriations bill, which called for benchmarks for the Iraqi 
government and funded our troops at a level higher than his initial 
request. But the Democratic majority signaled its willingness to fund 
the troops and fill the gaps left by the Republican Congress.

Now the Senate has taken the next step toward fiscal responsibility. 
We have a sensible fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. The $2.9 billion 
budget in fiscal year 2008 projects revenues expected to total $14.828 
trillion over 5 years, only 2.1 percent above the President's expected 
revenues of $14.826 trillion.

This resolution corrects many of the misplaced priorities of the Bush 
administration and the Republican Congress.

These misplaced priorities include over $1 trillion in tax cuts, tax 
cuts that will cost $3 trillion more if extended over the next 10 
years.

When President Clinton left office, the national debt was projected 
to be eliminated by 2010. These misplaced priorities created a $248 
billion deficit this year, and an $8.9 trillion debt.

This budget resolution restores funding for over 141 programs slated 
for cuts or elimination by the President in his budget proposal. These 
were painful cuts that we have seen year after year under the 
Republican majority.

The proposed cuts were to programs vital to Californians and the 
American people. Programs like the Community Development Block Grant, 
Community Oriented Policing Services, and the State Criminal Alien 
Assistance Program. These do not sound to me like frivolous programs.

Unlike the President's budget proposal, this budget will create a 
surplus in 2012 and is near balance a year before that. This budget 
refocuses our priorities, extending the middle class tax-cuts and 
alternative minimum tax relief, and increasing veterans' and children's 
health care funding.

In fact, this budget provides over $43 billion for veterans' 
programs, $3.6 billion more than the President requested for 2008 and 
the largest increase ever provided for veterans. This is in accordance 
with a request of four leading veterans groups and a recommendation 
from the American Legion.

It also provides up to $50 billion to expand SCHIP coverage for 
children eligible for the program. Both of these increases help the 
people most vulnerable and most in need.

This budget restores a fiscally responsible pay-go rule that requires 
offsets for new spending or expensive tax cuts.

This budget adds $9.5 billion to help fund education, including 
higher education, to help increase the competitiveness of our students 
in an increasingly globalized world. We know there is a problem with 
education in the United States, and this budget looks to address it.

This budget allows for the committees to secure increased funding for 
programs like the State Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, 
Medicaid, middle-class tax relief, education, alternative energies, and 
other important priorities.

It also allows for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for the San Joaquin 
River Restoration Settlement Act, a provision I and my colleague 
Senator Boxer requested. This broadly supported bill will help bring 
about tremendous progress in the restoration of a waterway vital to the 
state of California, and the reserve fund will help ensure that we fund 
the restoration in the correct manner.

This budget is not perfect, and I am deeply concerned about the long-
term fiscal implications of irresponsible tax cuts and a seemingly 
endless war. We are faced with a tremendous wall of debt, created by 
misplaced priorities and poor planning.

We must now turn to reversing the damage. This problem will not fix 
itself. We need to act now to reduce our budget deficit and pay down 
the debt.

The elimination of the deficit will not happen in one year, but will 
take years of careful planning and prioritization to ensure the best 
return for our Federal dollars. But I am encouraged that this budget 
will both fund the most beneficial programs and start us on the path of 
fiscal recovery.

Congress faced many tough choices in crafting this budget, and we 
have a long and difficult road ahead.

The budget resolution cannot provide permanent alternative minimum 
tax relief or even fully fund the most critical programs.

But it is a start. It refocuses our priorities. And it begins to 
reverse the years of damage.

I encourage my Democratic and Republican colleagues to consider the 
responsibility that the American public has given us. A responsibility 
to act in the best interest of this Nation. To pass a sensible and 
reasonable budget, and to use that budget as we craft and pass the 
appropriations bills in a reasonable amount of time. This budget fits 
that charge, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the 
fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.
