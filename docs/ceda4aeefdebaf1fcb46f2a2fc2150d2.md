# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `ceda4aeefdebaf1fcb46f2a2fc2150d2`
`Mr. SHAYS â€” 16 February 2007`

Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I 
thank you, Mr. Speaker, for conducting this debate.

This debate has been constructive. I appreciate the thoughtful 
comments made on both sides. Speaking for the second time, I realize it 
may be tempting for some to support this resolution to somehow express 
our strong dissatisfaction with how the administration has conducted 
the war and to separate ourselves from an unpopular President.

I do not believe, however, support of what is truly a ''stay the 
course,'' ''status quo resolution'' will be a constructive outcome of 
the debate. It sends the wrong message to our troops, to the Iraqis, to 
our allies throughout the world, and, in particular, to our enemies.

Is it the American way to attack another country, disassemble its 
entire security forces--military, border patrol and police--and then 
leave before this broken country is capable to rebuild its security 
forces and stand on its own? The shame of this possibility haunts me.



And how can this resolution possibly help our troops on the 
battlefield who are there already who still have to carry out their 
mission?

We, the Congress, are in effect telling our troops, we support you, 
but we do not want you to have the reinforcements you need to carry out 
your mission, and we do not trust the judgment of your new commanding 
officer, General David Petraeus. How destructive is that?

Our troops deserve to know we have a plan to win. If we do not have a 
plan to win, we have a plan to leave. The resolution before the House 
neither helps us succeed nor gives us guidance on how to leave.

It is so counterproductive for 535 Members of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate to micro-manage the war.

It is the responsibility of the administration to conduct the war 
effort. It is Congress' responsibility to conduct tough oversight, 
holding the administration accountable for the implementation of the 
war.

Having chaired 14 hearings on the operations in Iraq and been to Iraq 
15 times to conduct on-the-ground oversight, I will continue to ask the 
administration the difficult questions and provide my observations and 
recommendations.

Regretfully, too few Members of Congress have fully considered the 
consequence of leaving Iraq prematurely. The Iraq Study Group warned, 
''If the situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate, the consequence 
could be severe for Iraq, the United States, the region and the 
world.''

The ultimate goal for me is to bring our troops home without leaving 
Iraq in chaos. This is achievable if Republicans and Democrats, the 
White House and Congress, agree on a bipartisan solution as outlined by 
this Study Group.

Officially endorsing the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group and 
acting on them is the best way to make this happen.

The only way I think we should leave Iraq is the same way we got into 
Iraq, together.
