Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Staff Sergeant Justin 
M. Estes of Sims, Arkansas; who died on March 5, 2007, fighting for our 
country in Iraq while supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. Staff 
Sergeant Justin Estes was 25 years old when he selflessly gave his life 
for his country during combat operations.

After graduating from Oden High School where he played basketball and 
baseball, Staff Sergeant Estes joined the Army where he would serve in 
South Korea, Germany, Iraq and Macedonia. Staff Sergeant Estes was a 
member of the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., where he was 
assigned to C Company, 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry 
Regiment. He was serving his second tour of duty in Iraq.

Staff Sergeant Justin Estes gave his life to serve our country and 
will forever be remembered as a hero, a son and a friend. My deepest 
condolences go out to his mother and stepfather, Diane and John Salyers 
of Sims; his father and stepmother, Don and Cathy Estes of Harrodsburg, 
Kentucky; his two sisters, Norma and Kelli Estes; his grandparents, 
John and Clazina Visser and Joe Barry; and to his aunts, uncles and 
cousins. He will be missed by his family, his community and all those 
who knew him and called him a friend. I will continue to keep Staff 
Sergeant Justin Estes and his family in my deepest thoughts and 
prayers.
