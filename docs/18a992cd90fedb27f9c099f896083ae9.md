Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for 
the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.

This budget resolution provides Congress with a $2.9 trillion 
spending blueprint for the upcoming year. It establishes a process and 
guidelines by which Congress will determine the revenues and spending 
for the Federal Government.

I support this resolution. It puts our Nation on the road back to 
fiscal responsibility. Nevertheless, I am deeply concerned about our 
Nation's fiscal health.

We have moved a long way from where we were 6 years ago. When 
President Clinton left office, he left with a projected 10-year surplus 
of $5.6 trillion. That surplus could have allowed Congress to eliminate 
the Nation's debt by 2010.

But today, the Nation faces a $248 billion deficit and the debt has 
grown to $8.9 trillion. This translates to roughly $30,000 owed by each 
and every United States citizen.

It took almost 200 years for every President from George Washington 
to George H.W. Bush to amass $2.6 trillion in debt. President Bush 
matched their $2.6 trillion in debt in just 5 years.

And, over the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office projects 
the interest payments on the debt will be more than $3 trillion. That 
is $3 trillion that cannot be spent on priorities like healthcare, 
education or homeland security.

This should be a major concern to the American people.

Our Nation is in this situation because of the misplaced policies of 
the Bush administration and the Republican Congress.

The President's tax cuts have cost this Nation over $1 trillion. Over 
the next 10 years, these tax cuts will cost over $3 trillion more.

The vast majority of these tax cuts have gone to benefit the very 
wealthy.

Additionally, the War in Iraq and Afghanistan has cost $510 billion 
to date. And there is no end in sight.

This has squeezed the budget and made it difficult to fund all those 
programs that deserve funding.

Let me tell you what this means.

When the President submitted his budget proposal to Congress on 
February 5, it was deeply flawed.

It cut or eliminated 141 programs, programs that are of great 
importance to the American people.

My home State of California was especially hard hit.

The President's budget proposed cutting Community Development Block 
Grants by 21 percent. This would have meant that California's CDBG 
funding would be cut by almost $140 million from its 2006 funding 
level.

This would be devastating.

In the City of Victorville, CDBG funds have helped revitalize areas 
of the city 3000 residents call home.

In Los Angeles, these funds have allowed 8,500 housing units to be 
rehabilitated. CDBG funds have preserved over 2,000 jobs and removed 
over 41 million square feet of graffiti.

Yet the President's budget did not support this important program.

The President's budget also short-changed the law enforcement 
programs that Americans rely on for their continued safety.

The Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS, program was 
eliminated under the President's budget, as was the State Criminal 
Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP. As a border State, these programs are 
essential to California.

Additionally, under the President's budget, the State Children's 
Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, was given only half of the funding 
that is necessary to continue to serve the children already enrolled in 
this program.

The good news is the budget before us today restores many of the 
President's cuts. For instance:

It funds CDBG at 2007 levels, plus an adjustment for inflation. 
California State and local governments can continue to work for housing 
and community development in low-income areas.

The budget also restores funding to the COPS program. It allocates 
$522 million for COPS, a program that has put over 100,000 police 
officers on the streets in communities across the country. And we have 
adopted an amendment by my colleague Senator Biden to increase COPS 
funding to its authorized level of $1.5 billion. I was proud to support 
this increase.

This budget also restores $407 million for SCAAP. And through an 
amendment I offered and the Senate has adopted, will increase the 
funding for SCAAP to its authorized level of $950 million. California 
has the highest number of undocumented aliens in the country. And 
California prisons house over 20,000 criminal aliens, incurring 
tremendous costs. Last year alone, California spent over $715 million 
keeping criminal aliens off the streets.



This budget increases spending on SCHIP from $2 billion in the 
President's budget to $50 billion. The $48 billion increase will allow 
for continued coverage of all currently enrolled children in SCHIP. 
This budget then goes one step further. It expands SCHIP, insuring an 
additional six million children who are currently eligible for this 
program but are not enrolled. Young Americans should not suffer as a 
result of the President's misplaced priorities.

Additionally, this budget provides critically needed funding for 
vital Veterans' care programs. Specifically, it provides over $43 
billion for Veterans, $3.5 billion more than the proposal offered by 
President Bush. This money will allow our brave troops to obtain the 
medical care they deserve.

After the alarming revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and 
other Veterans' facilities around the country, it is clear that we need 
to ensure that VA facilities provide the highest level of care. This 
proposal funds medical and prosthetic research and information 
technology; and it ensures that baseline operating expenses are met.

In addition, the proposal provides middle-income taxpayers relief 
from the alternative minimum tax.

Absent congressional action, nearly 20 million more Americans will be 
forced to pay the AMT next year. This proposal adds 2 years of relief 
from the AMT, where the President could only find room for 1.

Congress faced many restrictions and tough choices in crafting this 
budget. And lawmakers' hands were tied due to years of fiscal 
mismanagement.

The budget resolution is far from perfect. It fails to provide 
permanent relief from the AMT for middle-class families and, while it 
restores much needed funds in critical areas, it does not fully fund 
critical programs. But it refocuses our priorities. And it takes 
important steps to restore fiscal responsibility.

Unlike the President's budget proposal, this budget will create a 
surplus in 2012 and is nearly balanced a year before that.

Change will take time. And there is no cure-all for the years of 
fiscal irresponsibility and misguided policies that we have seen.

As I said before, this budget is far from perfect. However, it 
initiates much needed change and I believe will put us back on the path 
from which the President and Republican Congress strayed.

Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to act in the best interest of Americans who have entrusted us with a 
great responsibility. I hope that they will join me today in meeting 
this responsibility by voting for the fiscal year 2008 budget 
resolution.
