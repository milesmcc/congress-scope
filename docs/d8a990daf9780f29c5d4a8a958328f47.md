`Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland â€” 10 March 2010`

Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland. Our military risk their lives and our Nation 
spends resources in a country that has so little hope of future 
success, that international terrorism actually flourishes in so many 
countries. Estimates are that this kind of terrorism actually 
flourishes in about 70 countries. And yet we are so heavily invested in 
Afghanistan that it leaves us little time, opportunity, or resources to 
really fight the battle where that needs to happen. By focusing our 
military and our energy and our treasury on Afghanistan, we are really 
operating under the inaccurate Bush era philosophy that the threat we 
face is both well-organized, centralized, and advanced.

We know that violent fundamentalism often operates with little 
centralization and little organization. It is part of the reason that 
it can be so successful. This war is a constant reminder that our 
response to the quickly evolving threat of international terrorism is 
static, and we must end this war and look for ways to more effectively 
disrupt violent plots to protect our citizens, our national security, 
our


safety and security, and to build nations in a way that they respect 
processes and people.
