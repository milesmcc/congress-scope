Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Chairman, I want to echo the comments of our ranking member, 
Mr. Young, and I want to thank Mr. Murtha for a good bill. I do rise to 
support it.

Clearly, if I'd written the bill, I would have written it differently 
in certain areas. Overall, I wish our subcommittee could have done 
more, but I recognize we did the best with the allocation we have. The 
bill is $3.5 billion short of the President's request despite the fact 
that we're engaged in two hard-fought wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that 
are hardly over. In fact, the President has obligated us to a rather 
open-ended commitment in Afghanistan where casualties have been rising 
and where more money may be needed.

Madam Chairman, the first time America tangled with extremists 
overseas, President John Adams was confronted by partisans who chanted, 
''Millions for defense, not a penny for tribute.'' That was then and 
this is now.

At a time when Congress has found the ''will and the wallet'' to 
throw billions of borrowed dollars at every domestic program under the 
sun, some are finding ways to cut defense spending--sometimes subtly, 
sometimes not so subtly. I tell my colleagues who have pledged to 
support a strong national defense that this bill is the high watermark. 
In fact, it's all downhill from here.

I do support the reform of our military acquisition processes, which 
have come under examination. I do support Secretary Gates' program to 
reexamine our national security priorities in light of new, irregular 
challenges and threats that are proliferating well beyond Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

Take a look at a more belligerent Russia. Take a look at the Chinese 
capabilities in terms of their Navy, their air and their cyberattacks. 
Take a look at the things that are happening on the Korean peninsula, 
at the things that are happening in Africa and at the things that are 
happening in our own hemisphere.

I do worry about this administration's apparent obsession with this 
war-ism. I urge my colleagues to make sure we make enough investments 
today to ensure that we will be prepared to defend our interests 
against all threats in the years to come.

I do support the legislation, and as Mr. Murtha and Mr. Young have 
said, there is a pay increase in here for all of our troops, all 
volunteering. There is first-class medical care, a lot more money, more 
money for shipbuilding, more money for the procurement of fighters, 
more money for MRAPs in Afghanistan, and importantly, there is $500 
million for the National Guard equipment for both overseas and home-
state missions.



Madam Chairman, I wish we could restore the cuts to our missile 
defense. I wish we could ensure that our F-22 assembly line could keep 
going. I wish we had an immediate substitute for our future combat 
system. These are important elements that need to be addressed. All in 
all, this is a good bill.

I congratulate the chairman for his leadership, and I congratulate 
the ranking member. I am pleased to support it.
