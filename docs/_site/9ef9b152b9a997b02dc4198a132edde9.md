`Mr. REID â€” 10 July 2007`

Mr. REID. I guess rationality is in the eye of the beholder. The real 
facts here are that, on Iraq, for example, the bill the President 
vetoed was not filibustered. We sent a measure to the President that he 
vetoed that had 51 or 52 votes. It was in the majority. That is what we 
should do here.

It appears to me we are arriving at a point where, even on the 
Defense authorization bill, amendments leading up to a final vote on 
the Defense authorization bill, which is so important, are going to be 
filibustered. It is really wrong. It is too bad. We don't have to have 
this 60-vote margin on everything we do. That is some recent rule that 
has just come up in the minds of the minority.

Mr. President, we should move forward on this Webb amendment, move 
forward on the Graham amendment. We have confidence that a majority of 
the Senate supports Senator Webb. I don't know about Senator Graham's 
amendment. But why don't we let the body work its will and then move on 
to other things. We have the amendment we are waiting to offer very 
quickly, which is the one that has been worked on for a long time, 
which is the Levin-Reed amendment.
