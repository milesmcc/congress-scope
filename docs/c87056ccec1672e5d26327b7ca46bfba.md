Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, last weekend marked the 64th anniversary of 
the signing of the original GI bill by President Franklin Roosevelt, 
which


honored the service and sacrifice of our World War II veterans and 
launched millions of families on a course to prosperity.

Last week, this House supported a new GI bill for the 21st century 
that will provide the same hopes and dreams to our troops fighting in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

This bill is long overdue because the current GI bill fails to cover 
the full cost of a public education. The new GI bill restores the 
promise of a full 4-year college scholarship for veterans, and at a 
time when many of our troops are in the midst of multiple 
redeployments, we must keep our commitment to provide them the very 
best educational opportunities when their service is completed.

This bill is a promise to our veterans today and tomorrow that their 
service to this country will continue to be honored.
