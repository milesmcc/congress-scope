Mr. PAUL. Madam Speaker, this Saturday the city of Lake Jackson, 
Texas, will celebrate the accomplishments of United States Army 
Specialist Monica Brown, who, at the age of 19, has already earned 
herself a place in the pantheon of Texas military heroes.

Specialist Brown was recently awarded the Silver Star, the nation's 
third highest medal of valor, because of her heroic actions in 
Afghanistan. Specialist Brown is only the second woman to receive the 
Silver Star since World War II.

On April 25, 2007, Specialist Brown was part of a four-vehicle convoy 
patrolling near Jani Kheil in the eastern province of Paktia when a 
bomb struck one of the vehicles. Upon seeing that her comrades needed 
help, Specialist Brown put aside concerns for her own safety and ran 
through insurgent gunfire and mortars to protect the wounded soldiers. 
Specialist Brown used her body to shield five injured soldiers as she 
administered aid and then dragged each of them 100 meters away to 
safety.

I am pleased to take this opportunity to salute U.S. Army Specialist 
Monica Brown and let her know how proud I, and all of Lake Jackson, are 
of her heroism. I urge all my colleagues, and all Americans, to join me 
in saluting Monica Brown and all the brave men and women serving in 
Afghanistan and Iraq.
