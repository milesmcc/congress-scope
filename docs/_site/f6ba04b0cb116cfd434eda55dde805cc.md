Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

We are in a time where there is a complete fascination in this 
administration with contracting out. If you are happy with Blackwater 
in Iraq, then I expect you are perfectly fine with contracting the debt 
collection of IRS debt to private bill collectors. But there are some 
essential facts at issue which should give us pause to reconsider.

First, the start-up costs. We were told, in testimony by the IRS 
Commissioner, this venture was going to cost about $14 million to get 
up and running. The tab so far, $70 million, five times the anticipated 
cost to begin this venture.

Now, you might say, well, okay, start-up costs are a little more than 
expected, but how are we doing on receipts now that we have got them 
fully going, collecting these receipts? We don't have a very good story 
on that one either.

It was anticipated that $46 million to maybe $63 million would be 
collected. Coming in at about half of that anticipation, $32 million 
in. It costs five times more to start and bringing in about half as 
much as advertised.



Well, okay, $32 million. It still sounds like a lot. Well, not really 
when you consider the fact they have been given 118,000 cases with an 
unpaid debt of $512 million. For the kind of money we have invested, do 
you know what we are getting back? We are getting about a 6 percent 
return from this experiment in private debt collection.

You might be asking yourself, look, there must be some more efficient 
way to do this. Well, there sure is. Let's fund the IRS, hire, train, 
manage the debt collection. My gosh, if there is one government 
responsibility, it ought to be in making certain that the revenue owed 
is the revenue raised.

And the statistics show by the IRS themselves that for $1 spent on 
IRS staff collecting debt, you get a 20 to 1 return, $20 back for every 
$1 spent. Private debt collection, the IRS again projecting, at best, 
$4 back for every $1 spent. That's $20 if we hire to $1 spent, $4 if we 
hire to every $1 spent under contracting. And that's their projection.

Look, at $32 million collected and $70 million spent, we are 
collecting 50 cents for every dollar spent so far. That's pretty bad 
business. If we had spent the $71 million to hire a Federal collection 
staff, we would have already collected $1.4 billion. That is the total 
amount they project over 10 years under this experiment of private debt 
collection.

I sit on the Ways and Means Committee. And as we considered this 
notion before it became operative, I thought this is the most expensive 
way to do this. It reminded me of that $600 toilet seat that the 
Department of Defense paid for awhile back. I call this a $600 toilet 
seat of tax collection. Well, when you look at it, they have taken $70 
million to build this gold-plated throne and they flushed away $50 
million on this foolish experiment.

There are many reasons to end this ill-advised endeavor, and the 
speakers we present are going to offer those reasons. But the 
fundamental is it's a matter of dollars and sense, and this don't make 
sense.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
