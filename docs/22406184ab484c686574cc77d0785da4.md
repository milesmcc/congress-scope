Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as many of us have been doing 
over the past couple of years and months, I paid tribute to a fallen 
soldier in my district this past weekend. Private First Class Jones was 
young and vibrant and loved by his family. Those who loved him had to 
bury him, for he is another of those now fallen from the violence in 
Iraq. We pay tribute to him for his great service and his love of 
country.

It is time now for America to love her own even more. It is time for 
our soldiers to come home. As we prepare for the honoring of those 
fallen in many wars, it becomes more than a disservice to those brave 
men and women for the President not to join this Congress in the 
resolution of this misdirected mission, in order to ensure that our 
troops come home with accolades and recognition because their mission 
has been successful.

The political mission is a failure, and it's time now for us to vote 
on a supplemental that has benchmarks and, as well, timelines to 
redeploy our troops, whether to Kuwait or otherwise. Our troops must 
come home. I pay tribute to the fallen. I pay tribute to Private First 
Class Jones.
