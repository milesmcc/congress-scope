# UNITES STATES POLICY IN IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2007--S. J. RES. 9
## `03911110e30df2b1f4c3f1f8d94a4656`
`Mr. INHOFE â€” 15 March 2007`

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I see no speakers on the other side, so I 
will elaborate on my remarks. I appreciate the fact that the Senator 
from Missouri talked about specifically what would be the consequences 
of timelines or withdrawal. I can speak from personal experience, 
having spent time in Iraq. As I mentioned before, I plan to take my 
13th trip to AOR in a couple of weeks. I believe what is not understood 
by people who are debating these resolutions is some of the good things 
about the Iraqi security forces.

I had the honor of being in Iraq when some of the new leadership took 
office. I remember Dr. Rubaie, who is the National Security Adviser, 
and Dr. Jassim--I believe he was the Minister of Defense at that time--
they articulated in a very effective way that most of the differences 
between the two major factors over there were Western concepts, were 
Western ideas. It appeared to me that was the case.

As we debate these resolutions, we need to remember how we got in 
there in the first place. Remember what happened prior to 1991, 
remember the monstrous commissions that were made by Saddam Hussein and 
the number of people, the volumes of people who died tragic, painful 
deaths.

As far as the Iraqi security forces are concerned, it is pretty 
obvious to me that these individuals want to be in charge. I get the 
idea, when I listen to some of the people on the other side, that the 
Iraqi security forces somehow are inferior, somehow they don't have the 
knowledge and the capability, the potential to become great fighters. 
Yet when I talk with them, they are the ones who are anxious to get 
themselves in a position where they are going to be carrying the load 
for us.

The whole idea of the embedded training is that we put our people in


the rear to advise the Iraqis on what to do and to train them while 
they are actually embedded and fighting with them. This has worked very 
effectively. It has been effective.

I happened to be there at a time when in one of the training areas 
for Iraqi security forces, there was an explosion. Some 40 were killed.

What the people over here don't understand is the commitment the 
Iraqis have to their own security. It happens that 40 families of those 
who were killed in this blast all supplied another member of their 
family to go in and carry the load for the deceased trainee.

These individuals are committed. They are as anxious as we are to get 
to the point where they have the capability of offering the security 
against the terrorists. From time to time, they have gotten that way. 
There was a time when the entire western one-third of Baghdad was under 
security control by the Iraqis themselves. They were just not in a 
position to sustain that control.

We saw the commitment the Iraqis had in Fallujah, when a general who 
had been the brigade commander for Saddam Hussein--this guy hated 
Americans; he was a brigade commander for Saddam Hussein, until we went 
into Fallujah with our Marines and they started the embedded training, 
the embedded training referred to by my friend from Missouri. It was so 
successful and they enjoyed each other so much that this man, this 
general, his name is Mahdi, he looked me in the eyes and said: I hated 
Americans before all this happened. I certainly hated the Marines. When 
they came in and started embedded training, I learned to love them so 
much that when they rotated out, we all got together and we cried.

This is the commitment the Iraqis have. When you get into one of the 
helicopters and go from place to place, maybe 50 feet off the ground, 
and you see the commitment of these individuals in the small towns and 
the kids who are down there--a lot of times the people who are 
supporting our troops send over candy, cookies, and this type of thing 
don't realize that when our troops get them, they normally repackage 
them, and then as they are in these helicopters going across the 
triangle and other places, you can see the little Iraqi kids out there 
waving American flags and our troops are throwing them candy and 
cookies. This is the type of relationship we don't see in this country.

Mr. President, while we are calling to make sure that some of them 
get down to the floor from both sides, let me suggest the absence of a 
quorum.
