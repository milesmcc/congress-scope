Demonstrator funded for $800 thousand to develop and build a STAR to 
validate performance and reduce cost/risk of next generation surface 
ship radar systems. This program directly supports the Navy's plan for 
an aggressive radar competition to help reduce the cost of next 
generation platforms such as the CG(X) cruiser.

Bill Number: H.R. 2638.

Account: RTD&E Army Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced 
Technology.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Patrick Power Products, Inc.

Address of Requesting Entity: 6679-C Santa Barbara Rd, Elkridge, MD 
21075.

Development Program was funded for $2.4 million to continue advancement 
of the company's auxiliary power unit technology to address the needs 
that the Army put forward. The RMF-APU development work has progressed 
to a point where the Army has accepted delivery of an RMF-APU from the 
company for fir check and demonstration in the M1 Abrams Main Battle 
Tank. The auxiliary power unit under consideration as a retrofit for 
the [Abrams] tank would reduce the Abram's battlefield fuel demand by 
as much as 50%. This would cut the Abrams daily fuel use in Iraq from 
$30 million to $15 million.

Bill Number: H.R. 2638.

Account: RTD&E Army Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technologies.

Legal Name of Requesting Entity: ATK.

Address of Requesting Entity: 5050 Lincoln Drive, Edina, MN 55436.

Description of Request: Advanced Fuzing Technologies was funded $3.6 
million based on lessons learned in both Operation Enduring freedom and 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. These lessons highlighted the need for multi-
purpose 105 mm and 120 mm tank ammunition to effectively engage a wide 
variety of targets other than enemy tanks. Multimode fuzing 
technologies are needed, including point-detonation with variable delay 
and enhanced airburst functionality at extended range. In order to 
address advanced 105mm and 120mm tank ammunitions requirements, funds 
are needed now to mature designs and support the evolution of these 
munitions.

ship service electrical power at speeds of 13kts and above. The Navy 
RDT&E funds will design and build a hybrid electric drive prototype 
system for insertion and testing at the Navy Land Based test site. 
Development and demonstration of a prototype DDG51 hybrid electric 
drive system will enable fuel savings, return of investment, and 
warfighter advantages.

advantage in today's world of increasing fuel prices and reliance upon 
foreign oil. The SSDCP will result in 10,000 times lower fault energy 
which protects personnel and equipment, while reducing chance of fire. 
Additionally, it provides greater survivability and mission 
effectiveness and lower acquisition cost and lower lifetime maintenance 
costs.

materials into renewable diesel that meets stringent EPA requirements 
for low sulfur content, resulting in a cleaner burning fuel and added 
environmental benefits.
