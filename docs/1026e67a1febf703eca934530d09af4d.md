Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let me read, Mr. Meek, to you from a, you 
guys all say third-party verifiers, right? Validators. Kind of means 
the same thing. Half a dozen, six. So this is from a report called 
Toxic Trade done by the Campaign for America's Future, and we'll go 
back to this problem that we have at the CPSC regarding toy testers. It 
says this: The agency's toy testing department, it's lab hasn't been 
modernized since 1975, and the department consists of one man who drops 
toys on the floor in his office to see if they'll break. I mean, that's 
it. There you go. I mean, that's the toy testing regimen of the United 
States Government is a guy, and I'm sure he's a wonderfully nice guy. 
But he sits in his office at his desk and he takes toys and he drops 
them on the floor to see if they'll break. I mean, that's what we got 
now. That's what you got for these record deficits, for all the 
spending in Iraq, for breaks for oil companies and drugs companies. 
You've got one guy who drops toys from his desk and sees if they'll 
break.
