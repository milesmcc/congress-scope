Mr. POE. ''We shall not flinch or fail. We shall go on to the end. . 
. . We shall fight on the seas and oceans. We shall fight with growing 
strength in the air. We shall defend . . . whatever the cost may be. We 
shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We 
shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight 
everywhere. We shall never surrender.''



These are the words of Sir Winston Churchill showing the dedication 
and determination of military warriors who fight for liberty. They 
never give up; and, of course, they never give in. Army Staff Sergeant 
Terrance Dunn was one of those soldiers.

Calling Atascocita, Texas, home, Staff Sergeant Dunn graduated from 
Pascagoula High School in Mississippi in 1987. In high school, he was 
known as the student always helping others.

In 1991, Staff Sergeant Dunn enlisted in the United States Army. He 
volunteered to serve this country and to become a part of an 
organization that accomplished great things. For him, the Army was his 
life.

For 16 years, Staff Sergeant Dunn devoted his life to protecting 
United States and its citizens from those who wanted to destroy us, 
freedom and liberty. He was always taking time to make sure that his 
Army uniform was in perfect shape, and he was proud of his service.

In one of the first letters he sent to his mother after enlisting 
into the United States Army, he told her that he was a real soldier now 
and he loved it.

Staff Sergeant Dunn was routinely away from the comforts and luxuries 
of home in Texas. He served tours of duty in Germany, Bosnia, Africa, 
South Korea, and, of course, two tours of duty in Iraq. He was 
committed to the service, he was committed to the American people, he 
was committed to his family, and he was committed to his duty.

As most military soldiers, Staff Sergeant Dunn was a very humble 
person about his service. He considered it an honor.

Family was one of the most important things to Staff Sergeant Dunn. 
He was the youngest of six children. He was close to all of his 
brothers and sisters and his numerous nieces and nephews. Even while 
amid the cannons of battle, he would call home to his family and check 
on them to see how they were doing, making sure they were okay.

Staff Sergeant Dunn was coming home to Texas in April, next month, 
after finishing that second tour of duty in that land far, far away 
that we call Iraq. He was assigned to the 210th Brigade Support 
Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. He was a 
mechanic for the United States Army and responsible for servicing 
vehicles and Army tanks. He was also tasked with fixing any broken 
equipment because he was a technological whiz. He could fix anything.

To his fellow soldiers, they called him the ''Dunnaman.'' If 
something needed done, Dunnaman did it, and it was given to him to do 
because they could always count on Staff Sergeant Dunn.

On February 2 of this year, Staff Sergeant Dunn called home to one of 
his sisters, checking on the status of the folks back home. With all 
the dangers of the Iraqi desert, his mind was always on his family. His 
sister had no way of knowing that that would be the last time that she 
spoke to her brother.

This is a photograph of Staff Sergeant Dunn taken shortly before his 
life was stolen from him. Because, several hours later, on patrol in 
Baghdad, an IED, an improvised explosive devise, hidden by faceless 
enemies that will not come out and fight, detonated near Staff Sergeant 
Dunn's patrol vehicle, killing this American warrior. He was 38 years 
of age.

Sergeant Dunn is the 18th American warrior associated with my 
southeast congressional district to be killed in this war in the 
deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan.

For his bravery and service to his people, Staff Sergeant Dunn was 
awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star. He was brought home to 
Louisiana, his birthplace. Staff Sergeant Dunn was carried by his 
fellow soldiers in the Army Honor Guard, and he was laid to rest with 
full military honors.

Staff Sergeant Dunn was an American patriot. That is a word sometimes 
we don't like to use, but he was, and he was proud to be a patriot. He 
was a hero to his family, his fellow soldiers, and to us. He served his 
country for 16 years, and he accomplished great things in the United 
States Army.

And remember, Mr. Speaker, he, like all the people in Iraq and 
Afghanistan fighting for this Nation and for the Iraqi people, are 
volunteers. They asked to join the fight.

So God bless the Dunn family and God bless Staff Sergeant Dunn. He 
fought for our Nation. He defended liberty in lands far, far away. And 
he never surrendered.

In the words of George Orwell, ''We sleep safe in our beds because 
rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would 
try to do us harm.'' The American soldier.

And that's just the way it is.
