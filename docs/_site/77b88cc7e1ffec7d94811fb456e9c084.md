Mr. BRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, last week I visited Iraq and Afghanistan for 
the first time as a Member of Congress.

The six-member bipartisan delegation met with soldiers, commanders, 
Iraqi and Afghanistan leaders and ordinary citizens. Though it was a 
truly eye-opening experience, it only strengthened my deep respect and 
gratitude for the men and women who serve in our military. They have 
always performed bravely and done everything we have asked them to do.

As we were in the Middle East, the President announced that an 
additional 17,000 troops would be sent to Afghanistan. Based on my 
observations in Afghanistan, a strengthened American presence is badly 
needed, along with a strong coalition. However, there should be a clear 
sense of mission with measurable goals in order to give our troops the 
best possible chance for success.

I look forward to working on the Armed Services Committee to ensure 
that we meet these goals and that our troops are always given the 
resources they need.
