Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I want to close and take advantage of another 
minute or two to speak on a separate note but a related note.

I wish to talk about Sean Durkin. He was a soldier from Fort Carson 
whom we just lost from wounds that he suffered in Afghanistan in a 
roadside bomb attack. Those are the most casualty-ridden attacks that 
our forces have faced over and over, not only in Afghanistan but in 
Iraq.

Last week, Army SGT Sean Durkin died at Walter Reed because of his 
wounds. He had been one of three Fort Carson soldiers who were 
presented a Purple Heart from President Obama when he visited Kabul and 
went to the military hospital when he was there.

On his Facebook page, he included a quotation from an unnamed marine. 
This quotation said:




 This is my charge to you. Tell everyone of the heroism of 


 the soldiers who lost their lives and of the soldiers who are 


 fighting to recover what they have lost.


I wanted to tell everyone here, everyone listening, everyone watching 
of Sergeant Durkin's heroism and ask that we keep in our prayers and 
our thoughts all of our service men and women and their families as 
they serve us all over the world.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
