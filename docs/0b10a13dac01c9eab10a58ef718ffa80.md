Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Marine MAJ Megan 
McClung who was killed in Ramadi, Iraq on December 6, 2006.

Major Megan Malia McClung graduated from the United States Naval 
Academy and was commissioned a second lieutenant in May 1995. She later 
completed her masters in Criminal Justice through Boston University. 
Throughout her career, she was stationed at various posts. While at 
Camp Pendleton, she served as the Public Affairs and Media Officer. She 
later served at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island as the 
Academics and Scheduling Officer, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point 
as the Public Affairs Officer, and finally at Camp Lejeune, where she 
served as the East Coast Regional Representative for the Marine For 
Life program.

Always dedicated to the mission in Iraq, Major McClung took a 
civilian position in public relations in Baghdad, Iraq in 2004. While 
there, she handled public relations preparation for Congressional 
hearings and escorted media throughout the theater. In 2006, she 
deployed with I Marine Expeditionary Force for one year in Al Anbar 
Province. While there, she worked as the Public Affairs Plans Officer 
at Camp Fallujah and later volunteered for duty with the Army's 1st 
Brigade, 1st Armored Division, operating in Ramadi.

Major McClung, the first female Marine officer killed in the war, was 
a polished professional who received numerous accolades for her ability 
to communicate complex thoughts and issues to various and diverse 
audiences across the globe. She volunteered to serve and sought to be 
where she could make a difference. Of her service in Iraq, she told her 
friends, ''Before we leave here we will make Al Anbar a safer place.'' 
She accomplished her mission.

In her passing, Major McClung has done what she did in life--bring 
people together to create a better understanding.

I wish to extend my condolences to Major Megan McClung's family and 
hope that they continue to find solace in Major McClung's lasting 
impact on both her country and her Corps.
