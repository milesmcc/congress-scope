`Mr. MICA â€” 11 September 2008`

---


Mr. MICA. Madam Speaker, I rise today, September 11, 2008, to once 
again honor and pay tribute to Sergeant Bryan J. Tutten, 33, who, like 
many other brave Americans, joined the military following the terrorist 
attacks on our homeland 7 years ago. Sergeant Tutten died in service to 
our country on Christmas Day, December 25, 2007, fighting insurgents on 
his second tour of duty in Iraq.

On Saturday, September 13, 2008, the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 
2391 in St. Augustine, Florida, will hold a special ceremony to honor 
the life and service of Sergeant Tutten. The Post will be renamed the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars Bryan Tutten Memorial Post 2391.

On Tuesday, January 15, 2007, I included in the Congressional Record 
the following remarks and today I want to again honor Sergeant Tutten's 
life by reflecting on his service to the United States.




 Prior to joining the Army, Sgt. Tutten, born in St. 


 Augustine, Florida, graduated from St. Augustine High School 


 and attended St. Johns River Community College. He was also a 


 member of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church in St. 


 Augustine.



 We should all remember Sgt. Tutten's courage and his 


 ultimate sacrifice for our nation. The freedom and liberty we 


 enjoy and peace in the world for others for which he fought 


 are part of the great legacy that Sgt. Tutten leaves behind. 


 He was laid to rest at San Lorenzo Cemetery in St. Augustine, 


 Florida on January 4, 2008.



 After the devastating events of September 11, 2001, Sgt. 


 Tutten enrolled in the Army. His family remembers him as an 


 avid sportsman who loved to fish and cook, and how he enjoyed 


 the time he had playing with his daughter, Catherine. He was 


 assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division based in Fort Bragg, 


 North Carolina which was deployed to Iraq.



 With the passing of Sgt. Tutten, America has lost an 


 outstanding citizen and a shining example of service to our 


 nation. He will be remembered as a patriotic American, a 


 pillar of our community and a compassionate husband and a 


 loving father.



 To his wife Constandina, his daughter Catherine, his son 


 Gareth, his mother Ms. Sylvia Smallwood and his loving family 


 and friends, we offer our deepest sympathy.



 Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize Sgt. Bryan 


 J. Tutten's contributions and to ask all Members of the U.S. 


 House of Representatives of the 110th Congress to join me in 


 recognizing his service in our nation's Armed Forces and 


 remembering a great American hero.
