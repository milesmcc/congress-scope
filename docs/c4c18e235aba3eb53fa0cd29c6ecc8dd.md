Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

On September 11, 2001, America was forever changed. The rancid acts 
of terrorism that occurred on this day struck a chord within the 
people. For one moment in time we were not a hyphenated people. We were 
not Irish-American, African-American, Asian-American, Greek-American. 
We were simply American.

It was with a resounding spirit of patriotism that Dennis J. Flanagan 
went to his local recruitment station and took the vow to serve his 
country. As the President waged war against our terrorist adversaries, 
Sergeant Flanagan took his place as a member of the air assault 
infantry that invaded Iraq in 2003. He returned to Iraq in September 
for his second tour of duty and was killed when his vehicle was struck 
by a roadside bomb in Hawijah, Iraq, on January 19, 2006.

Madam Speaker, I offer my condolences to the family of Sergeant 
Flanagan and hope that my colleagues will vote in the affirmative to 
pass this measure that will allow the Lecanto, Florida, post office to 
bear the name of Sergeant Dennis James Flanagan.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.
