`Mr. DREIER â€” 19 December 2007`

---


Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, we are all saddened by the passing of our 
friend and colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde). He will 
be sorely missed not only by his fellow Members, but by the countless 
people who came in contact with him on a daily basis.

One such person is Mr. Bert Caswell, a guide with the Capitol Guide 
Service. I am including for the Record a poem written by Bert about the 
late Mr. Hyde, as well as a recent article from The Hill discussing his 
poetry. I hope all Members will take the time to read this poem and 
remember Henry Hyde.











 Something's, You Can Not Hyde?



 Something's!


 You can not Hyde!


 That lives with us, so very deep down inside. . .throughout 





 our lives!


 All in what we say and do!


 All in who we so touch. . .that make us a real who's who!


 As in our times, that which so comes into view!


 For it's all about how you so carry yourself, as when you 





 rise!


 For it's all in what you so do, in others eyes, as your time 





 upon this earth goes by!


 For these, are the things that which one can not Hyde!


 Fast breaking in our lives!


 To court our hearts, all in our part called life that which 





 so defines!


 All in The Game of Life, you were so great Henry Hyde!


 Henry Hyde, was such The Man. . .


 Who upon the hardwood and on the floor of The House, did so 





 boldy stand!


 All because of his great heart, and stance. . .and his gentle 





 hand!


 From That Land of Lincoln. . .


 From one court of greatness to another, always thinking!


 As across the aisle he reached out his hand!


 Quiet in his calm and caring grace.


 For his service to God and Country he now so holds his place. 





 . .


 And for all of those magnificent children, he did stand!


 Oh, Henry Hyde,


 You were, But The Man! For in you we can so understand!


 What it is to be a leader, a patriot, a family man. . .and 





 God fearing man!


 Yes, In Life. . .Something's, You Just Can Not Hyde!
















 For the Record















(By Arie Dekker)




 Congress's day-to-day proceedings and debates can be found 


 immortalized in the official Congressional Record. The 


 record's nearly 2,000 books, comprising more than 150 


 volumes, line the brick walls of the Senate Library and 


 preserve the words of presidents, ambassadors, legislators 


 and Bert Caswell, a 54-year-old Capitol tour guide from 


 Baltimore.



 Caswell may seem like an odd addition to the Record of 


 floor speeches, inaugural addresses, scholarly essays and 


 research studies. But his unflinching patriotism as captured 


 in his accessible and unpretentious poetry is consistently 


 submitted to honor America's diverse heroes.



 ''I never thought I was a writer,'' Caswell said. ''I 


 thought writing was punctuation and spelling, and I can't do 


 either.''



 But when former Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) resigned 


 from the Senate to run for president in 1996, Caswell was so 


 moved that he wrote the poem ''The Measure of a Man'' in 


 Dole's honor. After the poem was casually distributed around 


 Capitol Hill, then-Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) officially 


 inserted it into The Congressional Record.



 ''And from that moment, my life was changed,'' Caswell 


 said.



 Caswell had written only two poems before and has since 


 composed more than 500 in tribute to lawmakers, presidents, 


 veterans, entertainers, athletes and others. About 20 of his 


 poems have wound up in The Congressional Record, after having 


 been submitted by members from both sides of the aisle.



 In memory of Sean Taylor, the football star who was 


 recently killed by intruders in his Miami home, Rep. Kendrick 


 Meek (D-Fla.) submitted a new Caswell poem to the Record on 


 Dec. 4 entitled ''Taylor Made.'' Meek's spokesman Adam Sharon 


 said Caswell and Meek talk as friends practically every day 


 about their comings and goings. He said Meek is impressed 


 with Caswell's ''big heart'' and willingness to go above and 


 beyond his regular duties--not only writing poetry, but 


 giving Capitol tours to special visitors like wounded 


 veterans and children from the Make-A-Wish Foundation.



 ''The congressman finds that extremely commendable,'' 


 Sharon said.



 Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) submitted a Caswell poem last 


 month to honor Gunnery Sgt. Angel Barcenas, a Marine whose 


 legs were amputated last year after sustaining injuries in 


 Iraq. Barcenas had previously served Presidents Bill Clinton 


 and George W. Bush on Marine One, and he recently led a group 


 of Marines, police officers, and firefighters in a formation 


 run to ground zero in New York City.



 ''Poetry has been a medium for not only documenting history 


 but also upholding the principles that have made our nation 


 great--principles such as courage, honor and perseverance,'' 


 Sessions said in an e-mailed statement. ''I applaud Bert for 


 using his gift of poetry to honor America's bravest.''



 Listening to Caswell talk about his poetry is like taking a 


 crash course in American history and culture. He has written 


 about sports legends, political leaders, war veterans, 


 firefighters, entertainers, civil rights leaders and 


 Holocaust survivors.



 ''I write about heroes, people that inspire me,'' he said. 


 ''I really am impressed with the people who have power and 


 fame, and yet they wield it and they make the world better. 


 And that's what it's really all about.''



 Caswell's subjects include sports stars Steve Young, Cal 


 Ripken Jr. and Mario Andretti; civil rights leaders Rosa 


 Parks and Martin Luther King Jr.; reporter David Bloom; 


 entertainers Bob Hope, Jason Alexander and Tom Hanks; 


 Congressional Gold Medal recipient Dorothy Height and former 


 astronaut and Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio).



 Caswell wears his patriotism on his sleeve. He makes an 


 ideal tour guide, welcoming Capitol visitors with instant 


 anecdotes about their home states' or cities' contributions 


 to the greater national identity. He will seriously discuss 


 their college sports teams' strengths and vulnerabilities, 


 impersonate California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), or 


 crack jokes about the highest court in the land not being the 


 Supreme Court, but rather a basketball court up the street.



 Caswell has worked for the Capitol Guide Service for 21 


 years, although he did not plan it that way. As an all-


 American lacrosse star, he played on the national champion 


 University of Maryland team in 1975. Before becoming a 


 regular contributor to The Congressional Record, he was 


 listed in NCAA record books as a top scorer at the 1975 


 Division 1 lacrosse tournament. He later coached the Maryland 


 team for five years.



 He earned two graduate degrees from Bowie State College, 


 one in education and the other in administrative management. 


 He then taught high school physical education and science for 


 about 10 years.



 In addition to being included in The Congressional Record, 


 Caswell's poetry has been presented at official ceremonies 


 and posted in government buildings. Several of his poems are 


 posted in the amputee ward at the Walter Reed Army Medical 


 Center. One of his poems is on display in a memorial to the 


 police officers who were killed when a gunman entered the 


 Capitol in 1998 and opened fire.



 ''I see more in three months than most people see in a 


 lifetime,'' Caswell said, drawing a connection between his 


 job as a tour guide and his passion for writing about 


 American heroism. He said working at the Capitol exposes him 


 to people from around the world and also gives him a unique 


 first-hand view of lawmakers, who he says are 


 underappreciated for their service. He is currently compiling 


 his poetry for a book that will include anecdotes about the 


 many famous people he has encountered in Washington.



 ''I have had the privilege of getting to know Bert during 


 my time in Congress,'' said Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who has 


 inserted three of Caswell's poems into the Record this year. 


 ''As a Capitol Hill tour guide, [Caswell] is instrumental in 


 sharing the rich history of our beautiful Capitol Building.''



 Caswell writes his poetry on a small laptop so he can write 


 wherever and whenever inspiration strikes. His writing 


 process is simple: He records what's on his mind, lets it sit 


 for a while, and returns typically only once to double-check 


 his work. He said the average poem takes no more than 30 


 minutes to complete.



 ''Mostly everything the first time comes out great,'' he 


 said. ''And then I go back and tweak it. Normally the first 


 draft's pretty good.''



 He does not have a favorite poet or style of poetry. He 


 actually avoids reading other poetry to keep his own work 


 pure.



 ''I don't read other people's work, hardly, because I don't 


 want it to change my words,'' Caswell said.
