Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 1538--the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007.

At the beginning of this month, when I was in Iraq, I spoke with 
soldiers who had just learned that their tours had been extended.

They said to me, ''Please, can you help us get us out of here.'' 
These troop extensions are really having an impact on the morale of our 
military men and women.

To add to that, soldiers see what has been going on at Walter Reed 
and they wonder whether they will be able to get the care they need.

The President has sent our troops into harm's way, extended their 
tours to support his surge, and has allowed these unforgivable lapses 
in the care of our wounded warriors under his watch.

When our men and women sign up for military service, recruiters 
assure them that the military will take care of them. The failure at 
Walter Reed calls the commitment given by our military recruiters into 
question.

The bill before us today will go a long way in making sure that the 
troops get the care they need and deserve.

I would like to thank my chairman, Mr. Skelton, and all my colleagues 
for their work in developing this important legislation.

I supported this legislation when it came before the Armed Services 
Committee on which I sit, and I am proud to support it today.
