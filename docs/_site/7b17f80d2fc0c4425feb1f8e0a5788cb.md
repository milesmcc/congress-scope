`Mr. ROE of Tennessee â€” 16 June 2009`

Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.

I wanted to come down to the House floor to let the troops know I 
support them and how much I appreciate the work they're doing around 
the world. I have been to Afghanistan and to Guantanamo Bay this year 
to see the work they're doing, and it is tremendous. We should all be 
proud of their effort.

Unfortunately, today's vote misuses critical funding for our troops 
to push through billions in foreign spending. People in east Tennessee 
question why we're giving $5 billion and over $100 billion in loan 
guarantees to the International Monetary Fund to bail out other 
countries when we have so many needs right here at home.

Additionally, because this legislation designates everything as 
''emergency'' spending, this spending is not offset and breaks the 
already-inflated spending caps. The way I see it, the only emergency I 
see is that a month has passed and the Democrats haven't added a few 
billion to our already record deficit in new spending.

I urge members to defeat this bill and force the Democratic 
Leadership to bring us back a clean supplemental that supports the 
troops.
