Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I remind supporters of the 
resolution that the newly confirmed commander in Iraq says this is new 
strategy and it will work, and he is the expert on counterinsurgency.

Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
Ryan), the ranking member of the Budget Committee.
