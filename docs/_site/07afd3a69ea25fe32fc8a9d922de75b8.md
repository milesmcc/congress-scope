Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this Sunday, November 11, will be Veterans 
Day. On this Sunday, our Nation will honor all veterans of all wars. It 
will be a day, this Sunday, to thank every man and every woman who 
wears or who has ever worn the uniform of one of the U.S. Armed Forces.

It will be a day to remember and to honor the dedication, the 
professionalism, and the courage of every individual who has been 
prepared to defend our people, our Nation, and our Constitution by 
taking up arms against our enemies.

On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, 89 years ago, in 
the dark year of war that was 1918, the armistice began. Tired troops 
laid down their weapons against muddy trench walls, weary gunners 
lowered their sights, the thundering cannons fell silent, and the 
fragile calm of peace was broken only by the crisis of celebration and 
the prayers of Thanksgiving. The United States had taken part in the 
largest war that history had ever witnessed, and it was finally over.


The carnage of World War I was of a scope and scale that shattered 
the soul. Battles took place across the globe and on the seas. It was 
the first war to take to the skies, the first war to see chemical 
weapons used on a large scale, the first war to see tanks and other 
heavy armored weapons employed. Pandemics of influenza had swept the 
globe on the winds of war, extending the suffering to new areas and 
into civilian arenas, taking my mother to her grave.

World War I caused the disintegration of four vast empires: the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the 
Russian Empire. In just over 4 short years, more than 20 million people 
were killed and more than 20 million people were casualties of that 
war. It was truly the cataclysmic end of the existing world order. But 
November 11, then called Armistice Day, became forever a day to be 
grateful for peace, thankful for democracy, and thankful for the men 
and the women who had done so much to preserve both.

People called World War I the Great War. They called it the War to 
End All Wars. Many people believed that no war could have been worse. 
But, alas, World War I was neither the greatest war in terms of size 
and complexity, nor was it the war to end all wars. Since World War I, 
the United States has taken part in World War II, the Korean war, the 
Vietnam conflict, the first Persian Gulf conflict, and now the second 
Persian Gulf conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. troops have also 
come under fire in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Somalia. Millions more American 
men and women in uniform have joined with their battle-hardened 
brethren from World War I to share in the honored title of ''veteran.'' 
In 1947, the November 11 Armistice Day celebrations were renamed 
''Veterans Day'' to honor all veterans of all wars.

This Veterans Day, with the Nation's men and women in uniform again 
in harm's way, the Nation will again mark with a moment of silence the 
11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. In that silence, during 
that peaceful moment, we shall send our love, our prayers, and our 
thoughts to the men and the women who will know no peace in the dust 
and heat of battle. We will send wishes of strength, of courage, and of 
luck. We will send our love, we will send our prayers, and we will send 
our thoughts to their families as well, and we will wish for them the 
strength to endure the long separation and the strain of worrying about 
their soldier. In that peaceful moment, we shall give thanks to all who 
serve and all who have served.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
