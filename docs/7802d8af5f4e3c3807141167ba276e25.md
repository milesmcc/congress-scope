Mrs. LOWEY. Reclaiming my time, first, I thank my friend for raising 
this important issue.

Yes, it is the committee's intent to fully fund Afghanistan's 
nonproliferation, antiterrorism, demining, and related programs at the 
President's requested level. We agree these programs are vital to our 
success in Afghanistan. And as we developed the bill, our funding 
assumption was, unless otherwise noted, that the President's full 
request for Afghanistan was met.

I yield to the gentleman.
