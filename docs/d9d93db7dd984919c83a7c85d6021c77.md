# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `d9d93db7dd984919c83a7c85d6021c77`
`Mr. SNYDER â€” 16 February 2007`

Mr. SNYDER. Personally, Mr. Speaker, I wish this resolution of 
disapproval articulated our disapproval of the administration's failure 
to accomplish certain chores in preparation for our fine troops 
undertaking this new mission under General Petraeus.

Everyone, including the President, now acknowledges mistakes over the 
past 4 years, but those well-documented errors are not the mistakes I 
am talking about. Now, today, mistakes are being made. Now, today, 
high-ranking officials in the administration fall short in their 
performance.

Why, after 4 years of the Iraq war, is the Secretary of State unable 
to get the appropriate reconstruction, economic development, and other 
necessary personnel to Iraq? Why did the State Department recently have 
to request the Defense Department to help fill in these necessary 
positions? Why have the efforts of political reconciliation been so 
ineffective? Why has the American diplomatic effort in the region been 
so ineffective? Where are the trained police and judges who will need 
to deal with all the detainees to be arrested in Baghdad? Why aren't an 
adequate number of property detention facilities not available for 
these future detainees that are sure to come from an aggressive effort 
to decrease the violence in Baghdad?

General Petraeus, clearly one of America's finest military leaders, 
during his recent opening statement before the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, felt an obligation to plead for the help and commitment from 
other U.S. government agencies commensurate with what our troops give 
24 hours a day, day after day, week after week, month after month.

I have had references being made to Winston Churchill, but I remind 
those speakers who make such comparisons that we are not a 
parliamentary system. If we were, the Secretary of State and other 
high-ranking officials would be gone because of their failures. We are, 
thankfully, the American system; and in our responsibility to support 
our troops, we know we must not just equip and train them. We know that 
all agencies of American government, the nonmilitary agencies, must 
pull their load if our fine troops are to be successful.

So we now have a situation where our new commander on the ground, 
General Petraeus, says he needs the additional troops. On the other 
hand, he says he needs all the other agencies of government to step 
forward with, in his words, ''an enormous commitment.''

It is clear this commitment of other agencies is not yet being made. 
Regardless of the result of this vote today, our troops will still be 
in Iraq needing the commitment of all government agencies.

The House leadership has stated that this resolution today is the 
first step of other legislation to come. This other legislation to come 
must address the issues of the shortcomings of other agencies of U.S. 
government, the nonmilitary agencies of U.S. government. Our troops 
deserve the help.
