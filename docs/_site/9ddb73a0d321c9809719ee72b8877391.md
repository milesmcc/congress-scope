Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I am compelled to come before 
the body today to talk about my deep concern about our continued 
engagement in Iraq.

In the past 4/1/2/ years, we have gone from ''mission accomplished'' 
to ''mission untrue,'' and, in the words of one of our colleagues here 
on the Republican side, to ''mission unknown.'' In fact, we are arming 
and fueling this growing civil war.

We have found Shia on Shia violence, Sunni on Sunni violence and Shia 
on Sunni violence. Our troops have no idea what the mission is anymore. 
I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that this is ''mission impossible.'' It is 
time to bring our troops home.

Just recently we found that 190,000 weapons are unaccounted for. 
There are plenty of weapons in the ministry of interior, which has come 
to be a police force against our own troops.

Mr. Speaker, we need to bring our troops home.
