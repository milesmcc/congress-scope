Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I have a very easy question: 
What does support for spinach farmers have to do with fighting the war 
in Iraq and Afghanistan? The easy answer is: Nothing.

But in the emergency war supplemental appropriation bill that we are 
considering this week, spinach farmers will be getting support. In 
fact, there is over $21 billion of unrelated spending in the bill; 
pork, pure and simple. And the purpose is simply to buy votes.

I thought the Democrats promised to stop all of this. I thought they 
said they were going to clean up Washington and not waste taxpayers' 
money. This is hypocrisy, and you have to ask why they need to buy 
votes if they are so confident in their slow-bleed strategy.

I said during the debate on this nonbinding resolution that the House 
considered a few weeks ago that micromanagement from the White House is 
wrong and micromanagement from the floor of this House is worse.

The emergency supplemental is not nonbinding, it is for real, and 
many Democrats will be joining Republicans to vote to let the generals 
run the war, not politicians, regardless of money for spinach farmers.
