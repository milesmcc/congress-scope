Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 445, 
which was introduced by my friend from Texas (Mr. Olson). As I added 
earlier, he served as a naval aviator. We appreciate his service.

This resolution recognizes 100 years of military aviation and 
expresses continued support for our military aviators in the United 
States Armed Forces.

As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am proud to 
speak in strong support of this resolution that honors the service, 
sacrifices, professionalism, and commitment of all those who have 
served as aviators.

For the last 100 years, the fact of the matter is that whether in 
times of peace or war, whether in Iraq or Afghanistan or somewhere else 
in the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week military aviators are 
always engaged, putting their lives at risk to protect our country. So 
I am honored to speak in favor of this resolution, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of H. Res. 445.



Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
