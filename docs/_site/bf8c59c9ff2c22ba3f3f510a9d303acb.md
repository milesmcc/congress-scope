`Mr. LEVIN â€” 12 July 2007`

---


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have a number of amendments which have 
been cleared, 10 amendments which have been cleared which we will 
describe in a few moments after Senator McCain speaks and after Senator 
Akaka speaks. We will describe those second-degree amendments that have 
been cleared on both sides of the aisle.

Again, I especially thank my ranking member, Senator McCain, and all 
the members of our committee for the extraordinary work they have put 
in on this legislation. It is, as I mentioned, comprehensive and 
desperately needed.

I also thank Senator Akaka, who is chairman of our Veterans' Affairs 
Committee, for his leadership because that committee has worked very 
closely


with our committee on this joint project. This is truly not just a 
joint effort between two committees but just about every Member of this 
body has had a role and a voice in this legislation. It is one of the 
best examples, I believe, of not only bipartisan action that I have 
seen in the Senate, but also a very speedy action and, we believe, very 
thorough consideration as well.

I yield the floor.

Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) Applauds Senate Armed Services Committee 


 for New Legislation to Assist Severely Wounded Servicemembers




 Jacksonville, FL, June 14, 2007.--Today, the Wounded 


 Warrior Project (WWP) applauded the Senate Armed Services 


 Committee for the introduction of the ''Dignified Treatment 


 of Wounded Warriors Act'', a comprehensive piece of 


 legislation that will greatly assist severely wounded 


 servicemembers. WWP was particularly pleased to note that the 


 bill included several of the legislative proposals that the 


 organization has proposed and supported.



 ''With this legislation, the Senate is telling our nation's 


 wounded warriors that they have heard their concerns and are 


 ready to take appropriate actions to ensure that these brave 


 men and women are taken care of in a manner befitting their 


 sacrifices'', said WWP Executive Director, John Melia. ''This 


 wide ranging legislation will improve the provision of health 


 care and benefits to injured military personnel and make the 


 system much more efficient as well''.



 The ''Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act'' is 


 sponsored by Senators Levin (D-MI), McCain (R-AZ), Akaka (D-


 HI), Warner (R-VA), Clinton (D-NY) and others. Among the 


 provisions included in the legislation, the bill would 


 require the Department of Defense (DOD) to adopt a Pre-


 Deployment Cognitive Assessment tool to help identify 


 Traumatic Brain Injury or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in 


 returning servicemembers. Additionally, it would require DOD 


 to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on 


 developing a caregiver training program for family members of 


 brain injured servicemembers, and reform the disability 


 evaluation and ratings system that military personnel must 


 navigate prior to retirement from service. The bill would 


 also create an overlap of DOD and VA benefits to allow 


 wounded warriors to benefit from the strengths of both 


 systems without having to choose access to one over the 


 other.



 In addition to these provisions, at this morning's Senate 


 Armed Services Committee hearing, eight amendments suggested 


 by WWP were adopted into the bill.



 ''These provisions have grown out of our direct interaction 


 with our wounded warriors'', Melia said. ''We strongly 


 encourage the Senate to pass this bill and to work with the 


 House of Representatives to ensure these vital initiatives 


 are included in the final version of the bill that will 


 hopefully reach the President's desk. We stand committed to 


 assisting in any way.''
