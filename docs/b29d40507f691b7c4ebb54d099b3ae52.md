Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the Iraqi National Assembly plans to take 
its regularly scheduled 2-month summer recess starting in July. Taking 
such an extended break demonstrates a lack of urgency on their part and 
political will on the part of the Iraqi parliament.

Defense Secretary Gates told a Senate hearing last month, ''I'll be 
blunt: I told some of the Iraqis with whom I met that we are buying 
them time for political reconciliation, and that every day we buy it 
with American blood. For this group to go out for 2 months, it would, 
in my opinion, be unacceptable.''

Accordingly, I have introduced H. Res. 469, which expresses the sense 
of the House that the Iraqi National Assembly should cancel or postpone 
its 2-month recess and work towards meeting political, social and 
military benchmarks. I urge my colleagues to join with me in sending a 
message to the Iraqi parliament that they must work to fulfill their 
obligations.
