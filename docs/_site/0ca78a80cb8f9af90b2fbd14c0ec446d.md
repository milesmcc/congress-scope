Mr. PAUL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to this 
appropriations legislation. It is unfortunate that my colleagues have 
decided to combine the necessary appropriations contained in the 
Veterans Affairs portion of this bill with the bloated and 
unconstitutional military construction appropriations. In the past I 
have voted in favor of Veterans Affairs appropriation bills when they 
were not combined with unwise and wasteful spending of other 
appropriations like military construction.

This appropriation will allocate $9.5 billion to close bases in the 
United States while spending nearly $12 billion building other 
facilities overseas. As a matter of fact, any construction of new bases 
in the United States is prohibited by this bill. While I am not 
necessarily in favor of building new bases in the United States, we 
certainly should not be spending money to close existing domestic bases 
in favor of constructing new bases overseas.

The bill will transfer more than $200 million to NATO, an 
organization with no purpose that should be disbanded immediately, for 
the construction of NATO facilities in countries where we have no 
business having our military in the first place.

We have been told that we will have no permanent bases in Iraq, but 
then again we have no ''permanent'' bases in Korea either even though 
we have had a military presence there for more than 50 years. It is 
unclear how much of this $12 billion will go to building new facilities 
to maintain an indefinite presence in Iraq, but any such expenditure 
will be counterproductive to U.S. national interests.

This appropriation increases construction funds to the service 
branches by as much as 50 percent over current levels, which is 
financially dangerous and unsustainable particularly in view of next 
year's record budget deficit.

Mr. Chairman, it is a tragedy that necessary spending to keep 
promises to American veterans should be held hostage to this out of 
control spending on maintaining an unnecessary and dangerous U.S. 
empire overseas. We are doing no favors to today's veterans or to 
future veterans--or to the U.S. taxpayers--with this appropriations 
bill.
