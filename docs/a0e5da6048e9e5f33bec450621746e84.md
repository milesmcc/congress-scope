Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. I yield myself 1 minute.

Madam Speaker, this is not a cheery time for the American people. 
This is a very difficult time. A reminder: The legislation in front of 
us now is to pay for the war in Iraq, to pay for the war in 
Afghanistan, to pay for our veterans' hospitals, and to pay for next 
month's Social Security recipients to receive their checks on time.

I reserve the balance of my time.
