`Mr. KLINE of Minnesota â€” 13 March 2007`

---


Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Yes. And I am smiling a little bit, but of 
course we learned a very tough and bitter lesson when we tried to use 
the Continental Congress to, in fact, command the Army of the soon-to-
be the United States and it did not work well. We would be foolish to 
try to duplicate that now. And, in fact, the proposed


supplemental, which we can talk about in a little more detail perhaps a 
little later in this hour, is an attempt to dictate the tactics that 
are being involved. It is micromanaging the war. It is taking away the 
resources that our troops need.

I wonder if I could take just a minute of our time here. I know that 
I have been a big supporter and I am sure you have of a bill sponsored 
by our colleague, a real American hero, Congressman Sam Johnson from 
Texas, who, as my colleagues know, spent 7 years as a prisoner of war 
in Hanoi and understands the stakes here as well as I am sure anybody 
in America. He has a bill that this entire body ought to get behind. It 
cuts to the heart of the matter and reassures our troops, our allies, 
and our enemies that we are not going to undercut our troops. So if I 
could just read a little bit of that bill because I think that that is 
what we should be about. I will skip a couple of paragraphs, all of 
which are important, talking about previous acts and resolutions of 
Congress, but picking up on subparagraph (4), it says: ''Members of the 
United States Armed Forces have served honorably in their mission to 
fight terrorism and protect the greater security of the United States.

''These members of the Armed Forces and their families have made many 
sacrifices, in many cases the ultimate sacrifice, to protect the 
security of the United States and the freedom Americans hold dear.

''Congress and the American people are forever grateful to the 
members of the Armed Forces for the service they have provided to the 
United States.''

In that light it says: ''Faithful support of Congress--Congress will 
not cut off or restrict funding for units and members of the Armed 
Forces that the Commander in Chief has deployed in harm's way in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.''

And that is the road that we ought to be going forward on. I would 
hope that more and more of our colleagues would sign onto this bill and 
that this really awful effort to take central funding away from our men 
and women who are, as we stand here now on this floor, engaged in 
protecting our freedoms and advancing the cause of liberty around the 
world, to keep that funding from being taken away from them.

I have talked to Sam many times. He and I are a part of an ever-
dwindling group of Vietnam veterans in this body, and he and I and 
others have watched what happens when our young men and women go fight 
and give it their all and have the rug pulled out from under them by 
politicians in Washington, D.C.

We watched what happens when combat operations are run from 
Washington, D.C., and it doesn't matter whether it is being run from 
the White House situation room, as bombing targets were selected sort 
of famously by President Johnson, or whether it is dictating from the 
floor of this House. We should not let that happen. And since this is 
the Official Truth Squad, I think that our colleagues need to 
understand that that is at the core of what this very dangerous 
supplemental bill has added. It is a terrible micromanaging of the war, 
and it will be forcing, forcing, our defeat in Iraq. And, 
unfortunately, with that defeat the war doesn't just end. We are still 
in a war that is going to last a long time against radical Islam, 
against jihadists. Were we to suffer defeat in Iraq, the war becomes 
tougher for us, not easier.

And I see we are joined by some of our colleagues.
