Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I raise the point of order that the motion 
to recommit that was just handed to me moments ago, a motion to 
recommit with instructions, relates to electronic surveillance and is 
not germane to the bill in front of us, which deals with Iraq, and I 
claim the point of order that it is not germane and should be stricken.
