Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1362, 
the Accountability in Contracting Act, which I have cosponsored, 
because we have an obligation to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.

I am simply appalled by the reports of pervasive waste, fraud and 
abuse in government contracting.

As chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime 
Transportation, I led a hearing back on January 30 on the U.S. Coast 
Guard's troubled $24 billion 25-year-long Integrated Deep Water Systems 
Project.

The project was supposed to modernize the Coast Guard's aging fleet, 
but a series of failures by contractors and poor oversight by the Coast 
Guard have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars instead.



In one of the more disturbing examples, the modernization of 49, 110-
foot patrol boats was halted when the hulls of the first eight 
modernized boats cracked upon being sent out to sea.

In the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and in the House 
Armed Services Committee, we have consistently heard reports of waste, 
fraud and abuse in Iraq contracting. Examples include: a report from 
the Iraq Special Inspector General, Stuart Bowen. He found gross 
mismanagement in a $75 million contract awarded to Parsons Corporation 
to build the largest police academy in Iraq. According to the report, 
the police academy was so poorly constructed that feces and urine 
rained from the ceilings into the barracks of students, floors heaved 
inches off the ground and cracked apart, and water dripped so profusely 
in one room that it was dubbed ''the rainforest.''

Investigators fear that, with its structural integrity in question, 
the academy is beyond repair, and public health concerns are being 
raised.

Unfortunately, this scenario is not unprecedented. In total, Pentagon 
auditors have identified $3.5 billion in questionable and unsupported 
costs in Iraq reconstruction contracts. For one Halliburton contract 
alone, its $16.5 billion logistic civil augmentation program, the 
Defense Contract Audit Agency, identified $1.1 billion in questionable 
costs.

Halliburton whistleblowers have shed light on the company's deceitful 
practices, reporting that the company paid subcontractors up to $45 for 
a case of soda and $100 for a 15-pound bag of laundry.

And the IG in the past has reported that Parsons, despite spending 
$186 million of a $500 million contract to build hospitals and health 
clinics, has barely gotten the project off the ground, with just 20 of 
the 142 clinics completed. The list of such atrocities is endless.

Last Monday we visited Walter Reed Medical Center for a field hearing 
of the Oversight and Government Reforms Committee's Subcommittee on 
National Security and Foreign Affairs to investigate reports that 
substandard treatment is being provided to our troops and veterans. 
There, too, contracting played a role.

It appears that wherever we find failures in government these days, 
contractors are sure to be involved. We have consistently been told by 
this administration that privatization of critical government functions 
would cost less. But instead it has been both costly and ineffective.

We need accountability in contracting. We need the Accountability in 
Contracting Act. This vitally important legislation would institute 
critical reforms, including limiting the length of non-competitive 
contracts, minimizing no-bid contracts, minimizing cost-plus contracts, 
ensuring public disclosure of justification for no-bid contracts, 
disclosing contractor overcharges, funding contract oversight, and 
closing the revolving door.



Mr. Chairman, I want to applaud you for doing such an outstanding job 
on this legislation. And I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 
1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act.
