Mr. NADLER of New York. Well, I won't take that, but I yield myself 
the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, we ask every member of our armed services--2.6 million 
men and women in the Active and Reserve forces--to be willing to lay 
down their lives for our country in defense of our freedom, if need be, 
and they are willing to do that. And every time, whether in Iraq or 
Afghanistan or anywhere else around the globe, a member of our armed 
services is killed in action there is a grieved family, a lover, a 
wife, a husband, a mother, a father, a son, a daughter for all of these 
who are grieved and whose loss can never be made up. And we sometimes, 
except on Memorial Day, forget about that. And this happens all the 
time, too often, and we don't think about it too much. We ought to 
think about it because our freedoms are dependent on it; our way of 
life is dependent on it. And none of us would be here enjoying our 
freedoms if it weren't for the willingness of our sons and daughters to 
do what they have to do to keep us safe and free.

This resolution does not address all of that; it simply addresses two 
members of our armed services, one of whom was killed and one of whom 
was severely wounded. But the difference is that they weren't in a 
combat zone; they were murdered and wounded here at home, supposedly in 
a safe place. And it illustrates that even here at home not everyone is 
safe.

So this resolution mourns the death of Private Long and the wounding 
of Private Ezeagwula, and it extends our condolences to the family of 
Private Long and our wishes for the best recovery to Private Ezeagwula. 
It is little enough that we can do, but it is really all we can do at 
this point. It says we are grateful. It reminds us of the sacrifices 
that are made.

I appreciate Mr. Franks' introduction of this resolution. I urge 
everyone to support it. And as with the resolution I spoke of earlier 
today, I cannot believe anyone will not support it. So I urge its 
adoption.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the motion.
