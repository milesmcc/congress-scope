Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am dismayed at the lack of 
consideration given to Senator Cornyn's resolution on General Petraeus 
and the troops. I condemn the comments made by the Democrats concerning 
our commander in Iraq, General Petraeus. The vendetta against our 
military must stop.

It sickens me to hear the comments some Democrats are making against 
General Petraeus. By attacking his character and reputation, these 
Democrats are attacking all our men and women in the military. On 
behalf of all these proud men and women who sacrifice their lives every 
day for our Nation, I am here to say these actions and accusations have 
no place in public discourse.

Americans do not attack the character of those who risk their lives 
to protect us. The lies, deceit, and disinformation the Democratic 
propaganda machines are feeding to the American people must stop.

To suggest that our troops and General Petraeus are motivated by 
politics rather than patriotism and love of our country is wrong. It 
diminishes the sacrifice each of them makes and their families have 
made in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other places around the world.

These attacks are made by some of the same people who voted on 
January 26--this year--to unanimously confirm General Petraeus.

At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the Record rollcall vote No. 33.
