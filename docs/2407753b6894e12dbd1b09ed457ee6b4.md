# SUSTAINING THE VETO

`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 3 May 2007`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, following President Bush's 
veto of the Democrat plan for defeat, the House voted yesterday to 
uphold the veto and override the Democrat attempts to micromanage the 
war.

It is crucial that we achieve victory in Iraq as the central front in 
the global war on terrorism. Retreat will embolden our enemy. This will 
lead to the re-establishment of terrorist training camps from which our 
enemies would launch attacks against us and our allies.

We should trust the leadership of General David Petraeus and our 
military leaders. As the father of an Iraqi veteran and four sons in 
the military, I know firsthand of the excellence of our troops.

We must face the enemy overseas or we will face them again in the 
streets of America.

I urge Democrat leaders to work with Republicans to pass a clean 
supplemental bill and get our troops the funding they need to carry out 
their mission to protect American families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
