Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say to our President that 
the people have spoken and they have spoken quite loudly. Just the 
other night I ran into the family of Sergeant Kendall Waters-Bey, who 
was one of the first military folks who died in the war. He is from my 
district.

His family just said one thing. ''Ask the President what his plan is, 
his true plan for getting us out of there. Ask why is he being so 
stubborn. Ask how many have to die, like our relative died, and we 
still don't fully understand why.''

The President presented us with some statements last night, but we 
have heard them before. The American people have been patient, and they 
have simply run out of patience. So we must continue to loudly speak 
into the President's ear that the people do not want this war. They 
want to get our folks out of Iraq. Three thousand have already been 
killed, and others are being harmed every day.
