Mr. HOYER. As the gentleman probably knows, I have also indicated I 
thought General McChrystal ought to come to the Congress and testify, 
not only before the committees, but perhaps brief a bipartisan session. 
I don't mean an address to it, but a bipartisan briefing, either in the 
Armed Services Committee or on the floor here or in the auditorium. I 
think that's appropriate. As the gentleman knows, the President has 
been involved in very extensive consultation with the Cabinet members 
that deal with the national security issues, including Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen; General Jones, the National Security 
Advisor; Secretary Clinton; the Vice


President and others who are dealing with this issue.

As you know, there has been no specific request directed to the 
Congress at this point in time, either by General McChrystal, Secretary 
Gates, or the President, so that it may well be an issue of timing as 
to when they're ready to come to the Congress to lay out the specific 
plans that they believe we ought to pursue. But I think that everyone 
shares the conviction that this is a critical issue with which the 
Congress is going to deal, and that General McChrystal, who is the 
commander on the ground in Afghanistan, needs to come before the 
Congress and give us his best judgment as to how we can be successful.
