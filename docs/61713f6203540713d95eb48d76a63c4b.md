Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment, while well intended, would 
create a serious problem for the body. This amendment prevents the 
Appropriations Committee from reporting a bill with more than one type 
of emergency designation. Let me give my colleagues a concrete example. 
Last year Congress enacted an appropriations bill that included funding 
for the war effort in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as disaster relief 
for the gulf coast. This amendment would prevent that kind of 
legislation. That would reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of this 
Chamber already noted for lacking efficiency. I urge my colleagues to 
vote no.
