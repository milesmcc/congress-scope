# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, this week the Congress finally takes up its 
obligation to change course in Iraq. We have arrived at a new moment. 
Few responsibilities are more solemn for a Member of this body than one 
in which he or she is obligated to register a vote of no confidence in 
their President in a time of war.

Under different circumstances, I think most Americans would want to 
give their President the benefit of the doubt on matters of war, that 
they would want to trust the President's judgment to do what is right 
for our country, for our national security interests, and for our 
troops and their families who never leave our prayers.

It is a measure of how desperate matters have become in Iraq that the 
Congress considers this resolution of disapproval. Today, we find 
ourselves embroiled in a war that is not winnable, a religious war that 
is inconsistent with our original mission there, a war the American 
people no longer support.

And with 3,100 American lives lost, sectarian violence threatening to 
spill over into the entire Middle East, and no prospect for a stable, 
constitutional democracy in Iraq in sight, today we consider this war 
for not what we wish it were but for what it has so clearly and 
tragically become, a mistake of historic proportions.

As such, I will support this resolution opposing the escalation of 
this conflict. And with this debate, the Congress takes up its 
constitutional responsibilities with a sense of urgency and 
accountability that the public so desperately seeks from us. For too 
long the Congress has asked too few questions and been all too willing 
to put politics and ideology before our Nation's security.

To be sure, matters of war are the most serious that I will 
deliberate over in the United States Congress. Indeed, such a vote was 
my first in the Congress in 1991. But with this moment, Congress now 
has the opportunity to take the country into a new phase of this war. 
To me, nothing matters more than getting this right.

Four years ago, I voted against authorizing the President to go to 
war because, as I said on this House floor, I believed taking 
unilateral action against Iraq would ''weaken our moral authority, our 
military effectiveness and our ability to keep events under control 
afterwards.''

Today, 1 month into the new Congress, and for the first time since 
the previous majority rushed to authorize this war in October of 2002, 
every Member of this institution, Democrat or Republican, will face a 
different choice. With the situation so clearly out of control, Members 
can trust President Bush one more time as he escalates the conflict in 
Iraq, or they can support a change in direction that begins to redeploy 
our troops out of Iraq, that uses our military in the right way, to 
make our country safer and raise America's standing so that we have 
both allies and moral authority to address our threats.

To be sure, of all the concerns we take to the floor with, it is the 
deteriorating welfare of our troops that is most alarming. Of course, 
every American takes comfort in the heroism and the determination that 
our soldiers have shown. They have performed magnificently, but they 
have been charged with an impossible mission that undermines their 
incalculable sacrifice and has strained our military in countless ways, 
from manpower to morale.

As the father of one marine whose son has been deployed for the 
second time to Iraq wrote to me, ''You forget what it is like to 
actually sleep through the night without waking up to the horrible 
thought that you might not ever see your son again.''

Mr. Speaker, we all know our troops will do anything their country 
asks of them, but let us not ask them to escalate an unwinnable war.

Today, virtually everyone agrees we need a new strategy, everyone, 
that is, except for the President who continues to pursue an objective 
the consensus judgment of our Nation's intelligence agencies says has 
no chance of success. Indeed, in proposing an escalation of the current 
strategy, the President rejects conclusions drawn by the National 
Intelligence Estimate, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, his own 
generals and, perhaps most importantly, the American people. In so 
doing, he sends what could be as many as 170,000 troops into a civil 
war that is being waged along sectarian fault lines that have existed 
for more than 1,300 years.

Such a policy will not only make matters worse, in my view and that 
of the Iraq Study Group. It will also postpone Iraqis taking 
responsibility and postpone diplomatic efforts that we so urgently need 
to reach a political settlement in Iraq and avoid an all-out civil war 
that spills into the entire Middle East.

Mr. Speaker, I am not willing to stand here in the well of the House 
of Representatives and not move to change our policy in Iraq. There are 
too many lives at stake, our security at stake. I support the 
conclusions and recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, but 
I have crossed the Rubicon on this war. I support phased redeployment 
over the next year and will seek every opportunity to mandate such a 
change in law. But that begins with stopping this escalation

Mr. Speaker, I harbor no illusions about the President's willingness 
to hear this message from the Congress. Before long, it may be 
necessary to mandate reductions in troop levels. But the President must 
understand that the public and the Congress do not support his policies 
in Iraq--that if we can even hope to achieve a stable Iraq, a peaceful 
Middle East and a more secure America, our strategy must change. That 
is what this vote of no confidence is about. That is our obligation--
let us honor it.
