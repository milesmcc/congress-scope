Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from California for demanding 
accountability of how your tax money, Mr. Speaker, is being spent, the 
tax money of hardworking Americans is being spent, not only here at 
home, but also abroad in places like Iraq.

I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee, my fellow Blue Dog member, 
Mr. Lincoln Davis.
