Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Senator is accurate. I have 
studied the Levin amendment. I am opposed to it because of the fixed 
timetables. But let's proceed to the second one. I think we have 
covered the first, and I find it very helpful.

The second finding:




 The Iraq Study Group report found that ''[a] chaotic Iraq 


 could provide a still stronger base of operations for 


 terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally.''


To me that seems to have some basis in fact. Does the Senator agree 
with that?
