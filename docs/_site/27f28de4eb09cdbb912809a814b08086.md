Mr. KERRY. Madam President, we are currently being visited in 
Washington by the President of Afghanistan. He has been in the Senate 
engaged in a luncheon with Senators. I ask unanimous consent that the 
President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, be permitted the privilege of 
coming on the floor to be greeted by the Senate, together with his 
Ministers who are here for a series of important meetings.
