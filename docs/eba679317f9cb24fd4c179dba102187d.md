`Mr. LIEBERMAN â€” 16 September 2009`

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, I was 
surprised and puzzled by that statement of the President today, 
particularly because the President, I think, has been very strong about 
Afghanistan. He has called Afghanistan a war of necessity--for the 
reason that I said, because we cannot allow al-Qaida and the Taliban to 
come back into control. Forgive the analogy, but anymore than after 
World War II if the Nazis had somehow reassembled and attempted to 
retake control of part or all of Germany, we would have sat back? We 
simply cannot let that happen.

We also know if Afghanistan falls, if we accept defeat or for some 
reason retreat from Afghanistan, it will profoundly destabilize 
neighboring nuclear Pakistan and encourage the Islamist extremists 
throughout that region and the world.

My friend from Arizona is right. There is a sense of urgency that he 
and our colleague and friend from South Carolina, Senator Graham, who 
is on the floor, saw when we visited with General McChrystal and 
Admiral Eikberry and the Afghan national security leadership a month 
ago. Admiral Mullen yesterday said we have lost the initiative in 
Afghanistan. It is why President Obama deployed the additional 21,000 
troops in March and announced this new strategy.
