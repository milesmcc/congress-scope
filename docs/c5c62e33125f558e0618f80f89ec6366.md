Mr. KUCINICH. At present, Congress has before it, for consideration 
in committee, an Iraq funding bill which will keep the war going 
perhaps through the end of President Bush's term. It would order the 
privatization of Iraq's oil and open the door for the President to 
order an attack on Iran without congressional authorization.

Democrats were brought to power not to spread war, but to stop it. 
The administration took us into war for oil. We should not be 
confirming that purpose by promoting privatization in the Iraq funding 
bill.

The President desires to attack Iran without Congress asserting its 
constitutional authority. We should be asserting our constitutional 
authority to restrain another administration abuse of power.
