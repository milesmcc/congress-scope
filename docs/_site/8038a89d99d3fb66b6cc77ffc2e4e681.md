`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 19 July 2007`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I do not know what bothers the Senator 
from South Carolina, being antiworker, anti-union. We know this is the 
most antiworker, anti-union administration. This has nothing to do with 
education. We see what is happening over on this side. Slow the process 
down so we cannot vote on Iraq. Slow the process down so we cannot vote 
on energy. Slow the process down so we cannot vote on giving the young 
people of this country an opportunity to go to college. When is it 
going to end?

The students of America and the families of America ought to know 
exactly what is happening out here on the floor of the Senate. This has 
nothing to do with education. It is an insult to the workers' 
committees of this country.



We know this repeals existing law--existing law, which permits, if an 
employer wants to have a card check, respect for it, can go along. He 
is repealing that provision.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
