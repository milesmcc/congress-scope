Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Centralia, Illinois 
native Steven J. Breeze on being awarded the United States Air Force 
Distinguished Flying Cross and upon his promotion to Lieutenant 
Colonel.

Lt. Col. Breeze was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his 
role in a March 22, 2003 mission during Operation Iraqi Freedom. His 
low level flight lasted 3 hours, covering 590 miles. His skills saved 
58 lives and delivered an assault force on time to their destination.

I am proud to recognize Lt. Col. Breeze for his service to the United 
States of America. I join a grateful Nation in thanking him for his 
service and congratulating him on this award.
