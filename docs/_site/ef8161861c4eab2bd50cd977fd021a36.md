Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1424 for three 
simple reasons based upon my experience in the U.S. military:

First, today we're seeing 17 percent of those who wear the cloth of 
our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan returning with post-traumatic stress 
disorder. And over one-third are returning with a mental disorder from 
anxiety to depression. They will feed into our society. How can we not 
give them the same parity as we do to those who are double amputees and 
we give prosthetics?

Second, again in the military we put money in in order to prevent a 
greater crisis. We were the insurance for this Nation. Presently, we 
spend up to three times the cost, indirect cost of mental illness as it 
would take for the treatment. How can we not pursue this, both for the 
good of the individual and the cost-benefit for our society?

And the third simple reason is, I honestly do believe in the ideals 
that Hubert Humphrey said. The moral test of our government is how well 
it takes care of those in the dawn of life, the children, those in the 
twilight of life, the elderly, and those in the shadows of life, the 
sick, the disabled, the handicapped. I'm sure he would have included in 
that the mentally disabled, the largest disability in America.
