Ms. LEE. He is totally incorrect, first of all, and I think that 
$3.50 example explains why he's incorrect.

It is about priorities, Congresswoman Tubbs Jones. It is about where 
we put our tax dollars. Do we care about securing the future of our 
country? Do we care about our children's future? And that is what this 
is about. He has asked for $190 billion, as I said earlier, to continue 
to fund this occupation in Iraq. Well, I would think that a pittance of 
that money, when we know how much this would cost, would go to cover 
our children. And our children deserve it.
