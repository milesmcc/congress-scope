Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, due to the funeral of a family 
member, I was unable to be present today for votes. I take my voting 
responsibility very seriously. Had I been present, I would have voted 
''yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 63, disapproving of the 
decision of the President announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more 
than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq (Rollcall 
vote 99). Had I been present, I also would have voted ''aye'' on H.R. 
976, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief 
for small businesses, and for other purposes (Rollcall vote 102).
