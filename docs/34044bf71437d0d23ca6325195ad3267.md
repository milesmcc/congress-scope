Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, General Petraeus and Ambassador 
Crocker are understandably trying to put a positive spin on the Iraq 
war. But the reality is that this has been the worst military fiasco in 
American history. But one of the questions I would like them to answer 
is how, when the Iraqi government has over $56 billion of revenue this 
year, they have the gall to ask the American taxpayer for another $170 
billion?

They have $40 billion in reserve that they have gotten from oil being 
over $100 a barrel. The American taxpayer is paying more than $3.30 a 
gallon for gas, and yet Iraq wants another $170 billion? They have got 
$10 billion in reconstruction funds. Yet we are going to continue to 
pay for all their needs? But that is what we are doing. We are paying 
for everything from military training, all the way down to garbage 
pickup, with American taxpayers' money, when they have got tens of 
billions of dollars that they choose not to spend.

This is a disgrace, Madam Speaker. This policy has never been worthy 
of the sacrifice of our military families, let along their loved ones 
in uniform.
