Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 533, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 2956) to require the Secretary of Defense to commence 
the reduction of the number of United States Armed Forces in Iraq to a 
limited presence by April 1, 2008, and for other purposes, and ask for 
its immediate consideration.
