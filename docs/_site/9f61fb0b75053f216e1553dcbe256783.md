Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Speaker, I reluctantly support H.R. 5104, which extends the 
Protect America Act for 2 weeks.

Last year, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, 
notified Congress about a dangerous loophole in our ability to collect 
intelligence information overseas. Director McConnell estimated that 
the intelligence community was missing two-thirds of all overseas 
terrorist communications. Congress passed the Protect America Act last 
August to close this loophole. Unfortunately, the legislation contained 
an arbitrary 6-month sunset and is currently set to expire this Friday.

After 6 months of waiting, the Democratic majority is now coming 
perilously close to threatening the safety of every American. But 
rather than pass a long-term fix to the terrorist loophole, the 
Democratic majority wants another extension. The White House promised 
to veto the 30-day extension that the majority was going to bring to 
the floor yesterday. Today's bill represents a compromise for only a 2-
week extension.

The truth is we do not need any temporary extension. In fact, there 
is a bipartisan bill that we can and should pass today. The Senate 
Intelligence Committee already has approved a bill to close the 
terrorist loophole and provide liability protection to the 
telecommunication companies. That is being blocked by the Democratic 
majority.

As the deadline draws near, the urgent needs of the intelligence 
community must be addressed. This is no time for partisanship. This is 
a time for responsible action.

Any bill must include two critical provisions. First, Congress has 
the responsibility to enact long-term legislation that allows 
intelligence officials to conduct surveillance on foreign targets 
without a court order. A U.S. Army intelligence officer in Iraq should 
not have to contact a Federal judge in Washington to conduct 
surveillance on Iraqi insurgents.

Second, Congress must provide liability protection to U.S. 
telecommunication companies that responded to government requests for 
information following the terrorist attacks of September 11. Close to 
40 frivolous lawsuits against the telephone companies already have been 
filed. These companies deserve our thanks, not a flurry of meritless 
lawsuits.

Terrorists have not placed an expiration date on their plots to 
destroy the American way of life. Congress should not put an expiration 
date on our intelligence community's ability to protect our Nation.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
