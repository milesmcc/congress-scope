Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise 
today to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of MSG Jared Van Aalst, 
a native of Laconia, NH. Jared was killed on August 4 while stationed 
in Kunduz Province, Afghanistan. He was serving on his sixth combat 
deployment as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Jared exemplified the 
very best in our military's long tradition of selfless service on 
behalf of this great nation.

Master Sergeant Van Aalst enlisted in the U.S. Army on August 17, 
1995. After completing basic training, the signal systems specialist 
course and basic airborne school, he was assigned to the Headquarters 
Company. He later completed the Ranger indoctrination program and 
sniper school, and continued to rise through the ranks as a sniper team 
leader and squad leader. Master Sergeant Van Aalst was promoted to 
sniper platoon sergeant, platoon sergeant, and finally served as the 
noncommissioned officer in charge of Headquarters Company's 3rd 
Battalion Reconnaissance, Sniper and Technical Surveillance. He saw 
combat in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Operation Enduring 
Freedom in Afghanistan.

An exceptional marksman and soldier, in 2005 Master Sergeant Van 
Aalst defeated 147 of his brothers in arms to take first place at the 
service-rifle individual championship in the U.S. Army Small Arms 
Championships. He was later selected as a shooter and instructor for 
the U.S. Marksmanship Unit at Fort Benning.

Master Sergeant Van Aalst's many awards include the Bronze Star 
Medal, two Meritorious Service Medals, two Joint Service Commendation 
Medals, three Army commendation Medals, seven Army Achievement Medals 
and five Good Conduct Medals, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with two 
bronze service stars, the Iraq Campaign Medal with two bronze service 
stars and the National Defense Service Medal with bronze service star. 
He was posthumously awarded a second Bronze Star Medal and a third 
Purple Heart Medal, as well as the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. 
Our Nation can never adequately thank Jared for his willingness to make 
the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of American liberties, nor can 
words diminish the pain of losing this brave American. For his 15 years 
of service, he has earned our country's enduring gratitude and 
recognition.

A Laconia native, Jared was a graduate of Plymouth Regional High 
School in Plymouth, NH, where he was the captain of the high school 
wrestling team and one of the best wrestlers in the entire state in his 
weight class. He is remembered for his incredible drive and 
determination to succeed.

Jared has been laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. He is 
survived by his wife Katie Van Aalst, their two daughters Kaylie and 
Ava, and his parents Neville and Nancy Van Aalst. This brave New 
Hampshire son will be dearly missed by all.

I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life 
of MSG Jared Van Aalst.














 Sergeant andrew Nicol


Mr. President, today it is also my sad duty to pay tribute to the 
service and sacrifice of SGT Andrew Nicol, a native of Kensington, NH. 
Andrew, just 23 years old, was killed in action by an improvised 
explosive device on August 8 in Kandahar, Afghanistan, while supporting 
Operation Enduring Freedom. He served as an Army Ranger and was a 
member of the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, based at Fort 
Benning in Georgia.

Despite his young age, Sergeant Nicol served five tours in Iraq and 
Afghanistan and was awarded many medals for his valor. These included 
the Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense 
Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Combat Star, Iraq 
Campaign Medal with Combat Star, and the Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal. He was honored for heroic actions during a combat 
mission in October 2008 and was also awarded the Bronze Star Medal for 
Valor for heroic actions in northern Iraq. His actions during these 
missions saved the lives of fellow soldiers and led to the capture of 
numerous enemy insurgents. Sergeant Nicol was posthumously awarded an 
additional Bronze Star Medal, a Meritorious Service Medal and a Purple 
Heart. Unquestionably, he served his country with both honor and 
distinction.

Andrew was a 2005 graduate of Exeter High School. He was captain of 
the wrestling team there, and earned the respect and affection of his 
peers through his leadership and wonderful sense of humor. Andrew 
looked for challenges, from racing in New Hampshire motocross 
competitions to serving as a volunteer firefighter and EMT. He was an 
indispensable member of his community.

Sergeant Nicol exemplified the best in New Hampshire's long tradition 
of service to this country. Our Nation can never adequately thank this 
young hero for his willingness to lay down his life in defense of the 
American people and words cannot fill the void left by his death. I 
hope that Andrew's family can find solace in knowing that all Americans 
share a deep appreciation for his service. Daniel Webster's words, 
first spoken during his eulogy for Presidents Adams and Jefferson in 
1826, are fitting: ''Although no sculptured marble should rise to their 
memory, nor engraved stone bear record of their deeds, yet will their 
remembrance be as lasting as the land they honored.'' Sergeant Nicol 
has earned our country's enduring gratitude and recognition.

Andrew has been laid to rest at the New Hampshire State Veterans 
Cemetary in Boscawen. He is survived by his parents Roland and Patricia 
Nicol of Kensington, NH, and older brother Roland who lives in Boston. 
This young patriot will be dearly missed by all.

I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life 
of SGT Andrew Nicol.













 Staff Sergeant Kyle Warren


Mr. President, today with a heavy heart, I also wish to pay tribute 
to the life and service of Army SSG Kyle Warren, who was killed on July 
29 in Tsagay, Afghanistan, by an improvised explosive device. Warren, 
formerly of Manchester, NH, was on his second deployment to 
Afghanistan. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces 
Group, Airborne, based at Fort Bragg, NC.

Staff Sergeant Warren joined the military in 2004, entering the Army 
as a Special Forces trainee. Following Basic and Special Forces 
training, he completed medical training at the John F. Kennedy Special 
Warfare Center and School. By 2007, Warren had earned a Green Beret and 
went on to serve as a Special Forces medical sergeant during two tours 
of duty. His awards include the Bronze Star Medal, Army Achievement 
Medal, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan 
Campaign Medal, NATO Medal, Purple Heart, and Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal. Unquestionably, he served our Nation with distinction 
and honor.

A native of southern California, Kyle moved to New Hampshire in 2003 
to be closer to his mother. While in Manchester, Kyle joined the local 
men's rugby club and quickly made friends with his teammates. He is 
remembered for his wonderful sense of humor, remarkable physical 
strength, and exceptional kindness.

SSG Kyle Warren exemplified the best in New Hampshire's long 
tradition of service to this country. Our Nation can never adequately 
thank him for his willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense 
of the American people and words cannot fill the void left by his 
death. He has earned our Nation's enduring gratitude and recognition.

SSG Kyle Warren is survived by his wife Sandra, whom he met while 
living in New Hampshire, his mother and stepfather Lynn and Ed Linta, 
as well as his father and stepmother Del and Hill Warren. This patriot 
will be dearly missed by all.

I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life 
of SSG Kyle Warren.
