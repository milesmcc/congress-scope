Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, last week I talked to a father who lost 
his son in May in Iraq. He was, of course, devastated. He asked me a 
question: Why did my son die in Iraq?

That is a question that will be on all of our minds in the coming 
days when we receive the new report from Iraq. When we look at the 
report in a very calm, dispassionate manner, I hope we think about what 
is really going on in Iraq. What is really going on in Iraq, what the 
President has crowed about as a great success in these regions is what 
you might call the ''re-Saddamization'' of Iraq.

The President is going to brag about the sense that he is now giving 
more power to tribes and tribal sheikhs who at some point when we 
eventually leave Iraq will be better equipped and better armed to fight 
the central government that the President used to crow about.

I think we need to have a calm, dispassionate review of what we're 
doing. We are creating the conditions that could result in a worse 
civil war. We have to have a calm review and make the right choices.
