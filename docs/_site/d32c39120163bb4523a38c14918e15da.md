Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I stand 100 percent behind this 
bill for a responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. Much has 
been said. There are several points I would like to make going forward.



First of all, this is responsible. This is not something that was 
just put together. This was put together with military advisers of the 
first order, generals on the ground who were consulted, and by two of 
the most distinguished individuals in this Chamber, our distinguished 
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Tom Lantos, and our 
distinguished chairman of our Armed Services Committee, Mr. Ike 
Skelton. Nobody can argue their credentials. Nobody can argue the 
credentials of the military advisers that put this together.

But most importantly, the people that no one has mentioned, the 
entity that no one has mentioned, the most important entity of all is 
the American people. This bill represents the will of the American 
people. Seventy percent of the American people support this action 
today.

Now, let me remind you of the words of Robert Jackson, one of our 
distinguished Supreme Court Justices in the steel seizure case of 1952, 
when a similar situation was in place, where we were at loggerheads 
then with the executive branch and the legislative branch, but at that 
point, the Supreme Court decided that Congress has the authority. And 
Jackson went on to say that when the executive branch denies, 
disrespects and disavows the authority of Congress, we enter into what 
is referred to as a zone of twilight, or a twilight zone.



That's where we are now, to get out of this twilight zone of 
destruction and mayhem, of instability in the Middle East. You talk 
about stability in the Middle East. We are more unstable in the Middle 
East now as a result of what we have done.

Get us out of this twilight zone. This bill is the way to do it, and 
I commend it and hope we pass it overwhelmingly.
