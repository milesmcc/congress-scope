Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend I saw a couple of movies 
that everybody in this House ought to see: One is ''Charlie Wilson's 
War,'' which is about the Afghan war and driving the Russians out; and 
the second is ''Kite Runner,'' which is a movie about trying to rescue 
one orphan in the Afghan situation.

On the 15th of December, on Saturday, in a conference in Baghdad, it 
was announced that there are 5 million orphans created by the United 
States of America's war on Iraq. Maybe they are off by a million; maybe 
it's only 4 million. But when you see that movie ''Kite Runner,'' just 
imagine that being 4 million kids that are our responsibility because 
we invaded a country under false pretenses and we are continuing to 
leave a mess. Five million orphans at Christmastime.

Merry Christmas, everyone.
