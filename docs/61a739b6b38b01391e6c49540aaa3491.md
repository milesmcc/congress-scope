Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, first and foremost, I stand and I 
hope we all stand in support of our troops. But I also rise today in 
opposition to H. Con. Res. 63. While I believe that we all share the 
same goal of winning this war on terror and bringing our brave young 
men and women home, I regret that this bill before us today absolutely 
will not lead to that goal. Nobody wants this war to end more than 
those fighting in it and we need now to do what it takes to bring our 
brave men and women home, but to bring them home in victory. If we 
don't achieve victory, the consequences are going to be disastrous for 
the progression of freedom all over the world, and instead of taking a 
step forward, we would be taking multiple steps backward.

So what is the point of this resolution? Is it going to block the 
troop surge? Absolutely not. Will it end the war? Not a chance. Will it 
help our chances of achieving victory? Absolutely not. This resolution 
will demoralize our troops who are sacrificing themselves for us today 
and tonight, and this resolution will give comfort to an enemy. This 
resolution puts politics before the lives of our brave soldiers and 
there is no way in the world that I can support it. The only chance we 
have for victory is to support the President's troop escalation. It's 
not a sure thing, but it's our best chance for victory. These added 
troops will help us secure Baghdad, stabilize the area, and accelerate 
the training necessary for the Iraqis to stand on their own. Only after 
these things happen can we leave Iraq the way we should and that is 
victorious.

I fully support our Commander in Chief, and I think he has much more 
information than I have or any other Member or combination of Members 
in regard to our war on terrorism, and particularly the war in Iraq. I 
think President Bush is a godly person, intelligent and educated, and 
cares for this country and cares for those who defend it. I will 
continue to support him as long as he holds the title of Commander in 
Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. I heard the 
President loud and clear in his State of the Union address on January 
23, 2007. What I gleaned from his speech is that he is asking for 
calendar year 2007 to complete the existing plan being implemented by 
General Petraeus and those who serve under him. And at such time, he 
fully expects the Iraqis to be in a position to defend their borders 
and protect their people, resulting in an executive order hopefully to 
bring the process of withdrawal of these American forces still 
defending our Nation, to bring them home.

This resolution will absolutely undermine the efforts of our troops 
in Iraq. I strongly oppose it.
