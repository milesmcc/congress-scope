Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will move $1 million from 
the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account to the United States 
Institute for Peace to reconstitute the Iraq Study Group. Although I 
feel compelled to point out the likelihood that by the time this bill 
is signed into law, the study on the effectiveness of the President's 
surge in Iraq will have passed, but, nevertheless, I support this 
amendment because I feel there is value added to reconstituting the 
Iraq Study Group, something that our ranking member continues to 
deserve kudos for establishing in the first place.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
