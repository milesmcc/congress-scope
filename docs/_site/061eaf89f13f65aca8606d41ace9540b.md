Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to give voice to many of my 
constituents who, as we approach the fifth Veterans Day since the Iraq 
war began, are as concerned as ever over our seemingly endless presence 
in that country and the ever-dimming prospects for peace. I've received 
a surge of prayers from my constituents regarding the war in recent 
weeks and would like to read two:

From Orange, Connecticut: ''Loving God, inspire our leaders in 
Congress to release Your spirit of wisdom, courage and love and end the 
war, death and suffering in Iraq.''

From Hamden, Connecticut: ''I pray that the hearts and minds of those 
making decisions concerning the war in Iraq be opened to finding 
viable, peaceful alternatives to continuing the war. I pray that the 
withdrawal of troops commence immediately, and continue steadily over 
the shortest period possible, to bring them all home. I pray that the 
light of God will fall upon the country and Iraq and bring about peace 
in that place.''

It is well past time to listen to these prayers, redeploy our troops 
and bring them safely home.
