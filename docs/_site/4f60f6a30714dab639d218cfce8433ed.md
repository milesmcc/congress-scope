`Mr. CANTOR â€” 4 March 2010`

Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman for that.

Still I would say that the Republican view is we have consistently 
supported this President in his efforts in Afghanistan as he has 
listened to the commanders on the ground to determine the focus and 
future of our presence there in terms of protecting our troops and the 
U.S. interests there. So I imagine my friend from Maryland, knowing his 
position on these things, agrees with that.

I would like to know, Mr. Speaker, whether there will be an all-out 
push to make this some type of partisan issue. Perhaps the gentleman 
could shed some light on his position on this bill that is being 
brought forward next week. And I yield.
