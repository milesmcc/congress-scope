Mr. GRAHAM. We are where we are as a nation. We have a porous border. 
Every time a supplemental bill comes through on Iraq, it gets the votes 
from this body that it needs to become law, because all of us 
understand, whether we disagree with the policies in Iraq, that once 
the soldiers and warfighters are there, our troops are there, there are 
certain things that have to flow from their presence, and we designate 
a lot of money for the Iraqi operation as emergency spending; I believe 
rightfully so.

Well, I would argue to anybody, Republican or Democrat, that one of 
the big chinks in our national security armor is a porous border 
between the United States and Mexico, and this $3 billion will really 
help in a serious way. It is serious money to deal with a serious 
problem that is truly an emergency. It will add more boots on the


ground. It will add agents for there to be a total of 23,000 border 
security agents on the border, which is a tremendous increase over what 
we have now. I think it is like 13,000 or 14,000.

But the technology in this bill will be a force multiplier. The 
technology we spend money to secure will allow the force in place to be 
multiplied by a factor of many because the technology literally 
leverages the boots on the ground in a tremendous way.

The 45,000 additional bedspaces will stop a program that is really 
the wrong message to send--catch and release: We catch you. We release 
you back. You come again. Now we have bedspace to detain people to make 
sure they do not flee, and they are deported for coming across the 
borders illegally.

It is an effort to basically deal with a problem that has been a long 
time in the making. There is money that will have a beneficial 
consequence to securing our borders. The term ''operational control'' 
is a military term. I look at this effort to secure our borders in many 
ways as a military operation.

I hope this amendment gets a strong bipartisan vote. I understand 
Senator Voinovich's concern about the emergency designation in spending 
money offline, but this is one of those times I think it is justified.

To the administration, I understand your concerns about spending, but 
you have sent hundreds of millions of dollars in requests over--
billions of dollars--to the Congress to make sure we have the money 
necessary to secure Iraq for our troops' point of view. Now it is time 
to spend $3 billion to secure our borders here at home.

I hope the body will understand this is a step forward. It does not 
solve the problem. We still have a magnet of employment that has to be 
dealt with. We need a temporary worker program. We need a lot of things 
this amendment does not cover. But this is a great start in providing 
operational security to a porous border that in the age of terrorism is 
really not only an emergency but a national disgrace.

I hope the taxpayers at large will see this as a serious effort to do 
something about a problem which has huge consequences over time if left 
unaddressed. So I appreciate Senator Reid working with us and Senator 
Cornyn making it better and my good friend from Arkansas, Senator 
Pryor, for helping us move the ball down the road.

If this bill ever gets to conference, which I hope it will, I hope 
this provision is left standing as is because if there is a retreat 
from this, from the money, and from the designations in this amendment, 
I think it would be considered a retreat in terms of regaining 
operational control of our borders.

So with that, I believe Senator Pryor wishes to be recognized.
