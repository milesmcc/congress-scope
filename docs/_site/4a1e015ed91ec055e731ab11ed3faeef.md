Mr. REID. We have had hundreds of soldiers who have killed themselves 
in Iraq. A lot of them are not suicide reported.

I so admire and appreciate what the Senator from Iowa is doing with 
regard to this legislation. It is so very important. Suicide is a 
national problem, and with the emotional and mental problems our troops 
are having coming back, we have to get to the bottom of this issue and 
see what we can do to prevent further deaths.
