Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I had the privilege, and I call it a 
privilege, earlier this year to travel to Kuwait, Yemen, Pakistan, 
Afghanistan, and then to Germany, where I had the privilege of meeting 
our troops who are committed, passionate, have an incredible love of 
country, and then to visit those wounded warriors at our facility in 
Germany. And I must say that there's nothing like having that 
interpersonal connection, that opportunity to make us realize the 
extraordinary sacrifices that are being made every single day.

So it is fitting that we have this resolution before us, and I urge 
all my colleagues to support this measure.

I yield back the balance of my time.
