Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, yesterday President Bush asked 
Congress to rubber-stamp his plan to spend $196 billion next year on 
the war in Iraq. I have to tell the President: not a nickel more for 
this war.

Since the beginning of this year, congressional Democrats have been 
trying to change a war policy from one where our troops will stay there 
for more than a decade, to one where we have a responsible redeployment 
and bring the troops home next year. The President believes it's 
acceptable to spend billions of dollars in Iraq, while important 
domestic priorities here in our own country go unmet.

While the President was crafting his $196 billion war supplemental, 
the Democratic House approved appropriations bills that included 
targeted investments in our priorities here at home: education, health 
care for veterans, more police on the streets, caring for American 
families.

Madam Speaker, as Congress begins to examine the President's latest 
war-funding bill, we will once again demand that the President change 
course in Iraq and get a responsible plan to bring our troops home 
within the year.
