# IRAQ RESOLUTION
## `804a709cdc416d6a44d68f79cde8fb45`
`Mr. HAGEL â€” 12 February 2007`

---


Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.

In conclusion, I add that the American people have had enough of the 
misrepresentations, the politics, and the procedural intrigue in the 
Senate. I say again to our distinguished leaders of both our parties: 
It is your responsibility, as leaders of this body, to resolve this 
procedural dispute so that the Senate can have a full, fair, open 
debate on the war in Iraq. And I will continue to join my colleagues--
Senators Warner, Collins, Snowe, and others--in making every effort to 
bring up our resolution at every available opportunity until that 
debate occurs.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
