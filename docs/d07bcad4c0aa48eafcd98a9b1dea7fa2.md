Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me first address the gentleman's comments 
about process and time.

We have been negotiating with the Senate and with the White House 
since last Friday. At approximately 12:30 last night, the majority 
staff on the Appropriations Committee finally wrapped up our work in 
putting this package together. At about 1:00, we communicated what that 
package was to the minority staff on the Appropriations Committee. It 
couldn't have been communicated any earlier because it wasn't done 
until 12:30. One of the reasons it wasn't done is because as late as 
10:00 last night, the White House was still squawking about individual 
provisions in the bill. And the last time I looked, the White House was 
in Republican hands.

Now, we have negotiated in good faith. I hate this agreement. I am 
going to vote against the major portion of this agreement even though I 
negotiated it, because I think that the White House is in a cloud 
somewhere in terms of understanding the realities in Iraq. But let's 
not get our nose out of joint about the way this package was put 
together.

We have tried in good faith to find a way to put the administration's 
request and their opponent's position on the floor on an equal footing 
to give everybody an opportunity to vote however they wanted on it.
