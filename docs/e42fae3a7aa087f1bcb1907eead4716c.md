Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I supported cloture this morning on the 
bill to extend and phase out increases in the Medicaid funding for 
States, including Connecticut, and to provide additional money to help 
local school districts in Connecticut keep teachers in the classroom 
during the upcoming school year. This funding, which was fully offset, 
is necessary as we continue to recover from the recession that began in 
2007.

However, I do have concerns with some of the rescissions from the 
Department of Defense budget that were used to pay for this funding, 
and I plan to work with Senator Reid and others to ensure that, as this 
bill moves forward, none of the offsets affects the ability of our men 
and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan from carrying out their 
mission.
