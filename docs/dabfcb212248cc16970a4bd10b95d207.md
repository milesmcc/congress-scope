Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, as I rise today, our Nation 
is in the midst of a deep recession. Families across America are losing 
their homes and business owners are being forced to close doors. In my 
home State of New Mexico, local workforce solutions offices are 
besieged with calls from people who need help. Customer service centers 
are cutting jobs and parents can't pay for their kids' school lunches.

Our responsibility is to act, and we must do so with the 
accountability and oversight the American taxpayers deserve.

For months, I have been advocating for an economic recovery package 
that puts the American people first, one that is carefully targeted to 
create jobs and stabilize our economy by making the long-term 
investments economists have said we need now. For years we have 
neglected to make the needed investments in energy and in conservation, 
infrastructure, health care, and so much more. Today we have the 
opportunity to change course. We have the opportunity to make these 
necessary investments and help shore up our economy at the same time.

I wish to thank Chairman Inouye and Chairman Baucus for their hard 
work in bringing this bill before us.

Make no mistake, the package we have before us is not perfect. There 
are many improvements that, after all the hours of work and all the 
hours of debate, could make it better. I rise to bring forth one more 
improvement we can make now.

Today I am offering an amendment which both helps address our current 
economic crisis and takes care of the very individuals who have been 
fighting for us: our veterans. My amendment, which I am proud to be 
joined in offering by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. 
Landrieu, will help ensure that our veterans returning from Iraq and 
Afghanistan are remembered as we push for job creation in our country.

The current language in the substitute amendment provides a tax 
incentive to employers hiring veterans who have been discharged from 
the armed services in 2008, 2009, and 2010. I strongly applaud this 
amendment and thank Chairman Baucus for his leadership on this issue. 
However, the numbers show veterans discharged before the years included 
in the underlying language are also struggling to find employment. In 
fact, in September 2007, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that of 
those veterans who served in our military since September 2001, 6.1 
percent were unemployed. As we know too well, since the study was 
completed in September of 2007, the economy has only worsened.

Therefore, I offer this amendment to expand the tax incentive to 
employers to include veterans discharged from the armed services 
between September 2001 and December 2010, including veterans of 
Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Those soldiers 
leaving the military after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, serving 
with great distinction and honor, are finding themselves back in a 
shrinking workforce. Yet we know from study after study that these men 
and women have substantial capabilities in technology, mathematics, 
management, crisis response, and so many other areas that are critical 
to employers. Expanding the tax incentive to cover employers who hire 
any veteran who has served since September 11 will help ensure that we 
do not leave these veterans out of our recovery package. It ensures 
that employers are encouraged to hire these men and women and put them 
back to work for our Nation.

The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America are strongly supportive 
of this expansion. I urge my colleagues to join me in adopting it 
today.

I yield the floor.
