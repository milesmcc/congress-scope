Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today we take another step in ending the 
war in Iraq as we consider the measure to withdraw our troops by next 
April.

Each day, support for President Bush's war crumbles as evidence 
mounts of the cost of this debacle: $10 billion a month, more lives 
lost, and thousands of hopes and dreams shattered.

We who opposed this war from the start for the reasons played out 
every day on the front pages of our newspapers understand that the 
redeployment of 200,000 American soldiers and contractors in Iraq will 
take some time to implement, but that is no excuse not to start now as 
rapidly and responsibly as possible to get our people out of the 
crossfire of this religious civil war. They have done all that they 
can, all that we should expect of them.

I call on the doubters in Congress to stop enabling the President; 
instead, to join us in supporting the strongest, most direct measure 
possible, not just to send the President a message, but to rein him in 
and bring our soldiers home from this nightmare.
