`Mr. WAMP â€” 6 June 2007`

Mr. WAMP. I thank the speaker.

Mr. Speaker, tonight I come to the floor with several of my 
colleagues over the next hour to recognize that while even tonight 
we've heard these divisions on the floor from both parties and Members 
in each party that have differences of opinion about Iraq and the war, 
we come tonight to talk about the threats around the world that 
continue to emerge, that are real.

But before we get to the discussion about those threats and global 
security and the need for our country to be the leader of all of 
civilization, civilized countries versus, frankly, uncivilized, 
organizations, factions, even countries around the world who actually 
believe that blowing themselves up somehow is right or just. This is 
the struggle, and I do not think we can afford to deny the threats. I 
want to start first, though, by honoring the people who are 
volunteering to this very day to put themselves between the threat in 
our civilian population and serve in the uniform of our Armed Forces, 
first and foremost, the ones that have actually given their life for 
us.

Last week, over the Memorial Day district work period, I joined the 
families of two heroic East Tennesseans, one here in Washington at 
Arlington National Cemetery as I left. Sergeant First Class James David 
Tiger Connell, Jr., of Lake City, Tennessee, was laid to rest here in 
Arlington a week ago Friday for answering the Scriptural call that ''no 
greater love hath any man than to lay down his life for a friend.'' And 
then on Memorial Day, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, I joined the family of 
Private First Class Travis Haslip from Ooltewah, Tennessee, to lay his 
body to rest. Two great American heroes who joined six other heroes 
from my district who have given their life for us. And contrary to what 
some people say, they not only did not die in vain, they joined the 
ranks of the greatest Americans ever who were willing to give their 
life for the cause of freedom.



They were willing to lay it all on the line for the principles that 
this country holds so dear, knowing that every generation sooner or 
later has to face threats like this and somebody has to go and answer 
the call.

If you believe they died in vain, then many, many, many others 
through other wars throughout the history of our country also did, and 
I don't believe it for a second, because I know that it is those 
patriotic Americans that have paid the price.

I want to honor tonight Sergeant Paul Thompson III of Jefferson City, 
Tennessee; Sergeant First Class Stephen Curtis Kennedy of Oak Ridge, 
Tennessee; Sergeant David Thomas Weir of Cleveland, Tennessee, and I 
want to talk about his mom in a minute; Staff Sergeant Daniel M. Morris 
of Clinton, Tennessee; Sergeant John Michael Sullivan of Hixon, 
Tennessee; and Sergeant Terrance W. Prater of Speedwell, Tennessee.

I want to say that Jackie Weir, Sergeant David Weir's mom, wrote me a 
letter which I received over the Memorial Day weekend. This incredible 
mom has on the bottom of her letterhead a quote from General George S. 
Patton. It says, ''It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. 
Rather, we should thank God that such men lived.'' This is on her 
letterhead. She gave her son for our country and its future.

This coming Monday, I will be privileged to join my nephew with the 
181st Field Artillery Brigade as they deploy for Iraq from Chattanooga. 
Jeffrey Watts is my nephew, so a member of our family is going as well. 
May God be with all of them, protect them and strengthen them.

Because, as John Stuart Mill once said, ''War is an ugly thing, but 
it is not the ugliest of things.'' He said, ''The decayed and degraded 
state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth 
war is much worse.'' He said, ''A person who has nothing for which they 
are willing to fight, nothing they care more about than their own 
personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of ever 
being free unless those very freedoms are made and kept by better 
persons than himself.''

That is etched in my memory, because I don't believe everything John 
Stewart Miller ever wrote, but I agree with that, that the alternative 
to war sometimes is complete loss of freedom, and it is tyranny, and it 
is terror all the time, and it is oppression. Without the courage to 
fight and stand up, that is where we may end up.

It is easy to forget the timeline. I want to go through it. Then I 
want to recognize the gentleman from Michigan. The timeline though goes 
back a long time.

We sure better not ignore these threats. We better stand in the gap 
for the next generation and quit denying that these threats are 
mounting against us. I don't want our country to be the last country in 
the world willing to face this reality.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan, the Chairman of 
the Policy Committee here among Republican Members of the House, 
Thaddeus McCotter, an expert on these issues.
