Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute the brave men and 
women of the Vermont National Guard, who will soon begin a year of 
service to our country in the rugged mountains and forbidding deserts 
of Afghanistan.

Tomorrow morning at Camp Johnson in Colchester, Vermonters will 
salute the first 35 Guardsmen and -women to leave the Green Mountain 
State and report for training at Fort Polk, Louisiana. They'll be 
followed shortly thereafter by all of the 1,400 Vermonters whose 
deployment will constitute the largest since World War II.

As we Vermonters bid a temporary farewell to our finest, their 
families and our communities will prepare to face the hardship of their 
absence. Yet our State can and will take pride in knowing that our 
loved ones and our friends and our neighbors who are devoting 
themselves to the service of our State and to all of the United States 
of America go with our support.

We stand proud to know that, as in every war since the Revolution, 
the Green Mountain Boys are serving our State and our country with 
strength, bravery, and honor.

We salute and look forward to your safe return.
