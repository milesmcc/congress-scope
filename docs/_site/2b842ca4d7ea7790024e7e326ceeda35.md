Mr. REID. These remarks are so important. I have had the duty--I feel 
it is my duty--to call home and speak to 55 mothers and fathers and 
husbands and wives and children of Nevadans who have died in the war. 
It is a difficult situation. I last week talked to a grandmother whose 
19-year-old grandson committed suicide a week after he went back for 
his second tour of duty. He killed himself in Iraq. These are real 
difficult situations. I know how strongly Members feel. So I certainly 
appreciate the feeling of the Senator from Oklahoma.
