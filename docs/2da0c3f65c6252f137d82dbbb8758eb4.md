Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
H.R. 3326, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY 2010.

Critical provisions have been added to this bill in order to help 
those facing incredible hardships during this difficult economic time.

The extension of expanded unemployment benefits until the end of 
February is a vital stopgap measure for those in dire need, and I would 
like to stress that this is only a piece of our urgent responsibility 
to restore the economic livelihood, and promise of opportunity to so 
many individuals and communities across the country.

I am also pleased to see that H.R. 3326 includes language prohibiting 
the establishment of permanent military bases in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Unfortunately, I cannot support the $125 billion included in this 
bill for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, nor can I 
support a continuation of runaway defense spending especially at a time 
when individuals and families across this nation are facing enormous 
challenges in simply trying to make ends meet.

Madam Speaker, I have been clear in my respectful disagreement with 
the President's decision to escalate the United States military 
presence in Afghanistan, as well as my belief that the situation in 
Afghanistan will not be solved with a military solution.

This bill does not include additional funding for the proposed troop 
deployments, and I am hopeful Congress will hold an honest debate and 
up-or-down vote on the issue of a military escalation prior to 
obligating federal resources.

The direct costs of two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have reached 
nearly $1 trillion, and the indirect costs to our national security, 
our economy, and to our brave men and women in uniform are 
immeasurable.

We further cannot afford to squander our resources on costly cold-war 
era weapons that in many cases are outdated and truthfully 
inappropriate for reducing the real threats facing our nation.

The fact is, as we work to reform our nation's healthcare and 
education systems, invest in housing and infrastructure, and put 
American's back to work, sending more than 50 percent of the federal 
discretionary budget to the Pentagon represents a clear and 
unacceptable tradeoff.

For those reasons I cannot support this bill.
