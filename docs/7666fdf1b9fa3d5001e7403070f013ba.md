Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New 
Hampshire for her remarks and for yielding me the time and for her 
leadership on the Armed Services Committee. I also want to thank my 
good friend from Georgia for his words in support of this resolution, 
House Resolution 443, which pays tribute to the 65th Infantry 
Borinqueneers and to the men and women of Puerto Rico who continue to 
serve our country with honor and distinction.

Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record a letter from Anibal 
Acevedo Vila, the Governor of Puerto Rico, endorsing this legislation.


























July 18, 2007.


 Hon. James McGovern,


 House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, 




 Washington, DC.



 Dear Congressman McGovern: Thank you for your efforts to 


 recognize the service of Puerto Ricans in the armed forces of 


 the United States, and in particular, the 65th Infantry 


 Borinquineers, by introducing H. Res. 443. Puerto Ricans have 


 served with great distinction in the military, and I 


 appreciate your efforts to highlight their service.



 The 65th Infantry Borinquineers were founded as an all-


 Puerto Rican regiment in 1899, and served in World War I, 


 World War II, and in the Korean War. It was in this last 


 campaign that the 65th Infantry earned their renown, leading 


 General Douglas MacArthur to remark: ''[t]he Puerto Ricans 


 forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry . . . are 


 writing a brilliant record of achievement in battle and I am 


 proud indeed to have them in this command. I wish that we 


 might have many more like them.'' During the Korean War, 


 members of the 65th Infantry were awarded 10 Distinguished 


 Service Crosses, 256 Silver Stars, and 606 Bronze Stars.



 As H. Res. 443 acknowledges, Puerto Ricans have a tradition 


 of dedicated and honorable service in the armed forces of the 


 United States. Military units from Puerto Rico were among the 


 first to deploy following the attacks of September 11, 2001, 


 and over 7,000 members of our National Guard have since been 


 deployed in support of current operations. Over 55 soldiers, 


 sailors and airmen of Puerto Rican descent have lost their 


 lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are over 144,000 


 veterans living in Puerto Rico, and four sons of the Island 


 have earned the Medal of Honor since Vietnam, the second 


 highest per capita of any jurisdiction in the United States.



 Puerto Rican soldiers in the armed forces today continue 


 the tradition of the 65th Infantry by serving with honor and 


 distinction and make all Puerto Ricans proud of their 


 service. Once again, I appreciate your introduction of H. 


 Res. 443 to recognize and commend those Puerto Ricans who 


 have served




 in the past and present in our nation's armed forces, and I 


 look forward to the resolution's adoption.





 Sincerely,























Anibal Acevedo Vila,














Governor, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


Mr. Speaker, it has been a privilege to learn about the proud service 
of the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers, the only Hispanic-segregated unit 
in the United States Military history. The first native Puerto Rican 
troops were approved by Congress in 1899, designated as the Puerto 
Rican Regiment U.S. Volunteers.

The regiment was ordered to war strength in 1917 and served in 
defense of the Panama Canal during World War I. On June 4, 1920, the 
regiment was officially re-designated as the 65th Infantry, U.S. Army.

After serving ably in France and Germany during World War II, the 
65th was ordered to Korea in 1950. It was during the Korean War where 
the 65th Infantry invoked the name Borinqueneers, and it is also where 
they demonstrated their military prowess.

The name Borinqueneers comes from the word Borinquen, which is the 
original native Taino Indians of the island we now call Puerto Rico. 
Many members were direct descendants of these native people.

The Borinqueneers fought on the front lines in Korea, participating 
in nine major campaigns throughout the war. They were the protection 
force for marines withdrawing from far inland positions. They were the 
leading unit in the United Nations offensive of April 1951. In every 
campaign they performed as one of the most effective infantry regiments 
in the Army.

Earning the respect and admiration of fellow soldiers and military 
leaders, General Douglas MacArthur himself remarked, ''They showed 
magnificent ability and courage in field operations,'' and ''they are a 
credit to Puerto Rico, and I am proud to have them in my command.''

Mr. Speaker, it is of the utmost importance that we recognize the 
valiant service of the Borinqueneers and that we recognize the 
sacrifices made by the people of Puerto Rico during the Korean War: 
61,000 Puerto Ricans served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, the 
overwhelming majority in the 65th Infantry Regiment.

By the end of the war, 743 Puerto Ricans were killed, and over 2,300 
wounded. One of every 42 casualties suffered by U.S. forces in Korea 
was Puerto Rican. Puerto Rico endured one casualty for every 660 of its 
inhabitants, a disproportionately heavy burden for the small island. 
This statistic highlights the enormous sacrifice by Puerto Rico, and it 
gives testament to the honor and distinction of their service.

Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note some current efforts to 
promote and preserve the history of the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers. In 
my district, the Korean War Memorial of Central Massachusetts 
Committee, along with Colonel Gilbert Villahermosa, Inspector General 
of the Massachusetts Army National Guard, and the Puerto Rican 
community of central Massachusetts are working together to commemorate 
the 65th Infantry.

The efforts have included promotion of the documentary film ''The 
Borinqueneers,'' construction of a memorial flagpole, and Colonel 
Villahermosa himself has released a book detailing the critical role 
which the 65th Infantry played in Korea.

Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to have introduced this bill with the 
Representative from Puerto Rico (Mr. Fortuno), and I would also like to 
thank Chairman Skelton and all members of the Armed Services Committee 
who supported its consideration on the suspension calendar.

Again, I want to thank my two colleagues, the gentlewoman from New 
Hampshire (Ms. Shea-Porter) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
Gingrey), for their words here today.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to pass House Resolution 
443.
