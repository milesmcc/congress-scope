Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the rule just recently adopted, I 
call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 63) disapproving of the 
decision of the President announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more 
than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq, and ask for 
its immediate consideration.
