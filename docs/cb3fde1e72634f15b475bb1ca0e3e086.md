Ms. SLAUGHTER. I simply want to say that the purpose of this 
resolution is to call attention to the fact that the State Department 
of the United States of America has refused to respond to subpoenas 
from a congressional committee. And if we are going to have a free flow 
of discussion on Iraq and corruption, as my colleague suggested, then 
we need to have the State Department give us the documents that we need 
to be able to do so. That is the purpose for this resolution, and I 
urge a ''yes'' vote on all sides from everyone who really wants this 
full discussion.
