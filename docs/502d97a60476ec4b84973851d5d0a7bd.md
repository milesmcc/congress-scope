Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am currently serving on the Ways 
and Means Committee. As many people have said this evening, I am 
blessed to be the first African American woman in the history of this 
country to serve on this committee. I am pleased this year to work my 
way to the Health Subcommittee. And on that committee, as a part of 
that committee, I have had the opportunity to work on the recent 
legislation passed by the House on August 1 that took a vital step 
towards ensuring the future health of America by approving the 
Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. It was called the CHAMP 
Act of 2007.

On the Health Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to talk with 
my colleagues and listen to testimony


from doctors and those in health care and those who provide kidney 
dialysis, et cetera, to help me begin to formulate my position on many 
issues.

One of the things that has been clear to me, however, is if we don't 
provide health care to our children, we are writing our future. I 
recently had the opportunity to go to university hospitals in my 
congressional district to participate with some young people in what's 
called the Healthy Children program and their focus on obesity, one of 
the biggest problems that faces children in our country and 
particularly minority children whose diet tends to be not as healthy, 
low-income folks, as folks who are able to choose fresh vegetables, 
fruit, et cetera. And as I was playing with these children, and we were 
doing exercises and we were rolling around the floor with these 
exercise balls and these various types of strings to help us lift and 
move our arms, I noticed that these young people were motivated, 
motivated, to change their eating habits as well as their life-style.

Obesity has claimed so many of our children. Back in the day when I 
was in school, I remember there was this President's requirement that 
you had to do so many sit-ups, you had to run so many laps, and you had 
to be involved in activity. And somehow we have to get our children 
back to that activity.

We have children with high blood pressure. We have children with 
diabetes. We have children who are working their way to kidney failure 
as a result of the lack of health care and the lack of preventative 
health care.

So there should be no surprise on the face of any person in the 
United States of America that we need to have health care coverage for 
all of our children.

Now, the controversy becomes how do you pay for it. And right now we 
are in this Congress where we are saying we want to be concerned about 
pay-fors. We want to be fiscally sound. So we either have to come up 
with a way to tax and change it, or we have to be able to reduce 
expenditures in other areas. I am one of those who believes that it is 
time to expend the money that we need to expend for health care, health 
care for all Americans, because I know we are spending much more than 
that as we fight this war in Iraq and we provide health care to the 
people of Iraq and still question whether we provide adequate health 
care to the veterans of our country who have been injured and maimed 
over there.

But today on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, it has been my 
pleasure to host this message hour. We have had an opportunity to bring 
to the attention of the American public our concerns about the State 
Children's Health Insurance Program, which will be debated on the floor 
of this House tomorrow.

I encourage America to tune in, listen in, and call in and raise your 
complaints, raise your concerns, and let Members of Congress and 
Members of the Senate understand how important you know that health 
care for children is.

And, lastly, I will focus back one more time on the Jena Six. It was 
great to have an opportunity with my colleagues to address that 
particular issue. And on behalf of our great Chair, Congresswoman 
Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick of the State of Michigan, I thank the Speaker 
for granting us this Special Order for today.
