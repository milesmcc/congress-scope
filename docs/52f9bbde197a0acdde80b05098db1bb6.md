Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Lance Corporal 
Anthony Robertson of the United States Marine Corps.

Lance Corporal Robertson grew up in Justice, Illinois and currently 
lives in neighboring Willow Springs. After joining the Marines, he was 
deployed to Afghanistan. While there, he was severely injured by a 
roadside bomb. It was an honor to personally congratulate and thank 
Lance Corporal Robertson, and his wife, Sheri Robertson for his brave 
service when we met on July 26th at a welcome home celebration 
conducted by the Village of Justice. His sacrifice will rightfully be 
honored with a Purple Heart--our Nation's oldest actively used military 
medal.

It is a privilege to welcome home to his family and community someone 
who has given so much. As Lance Corporal Robertson prepares to enter 
the ranks of almost 600,000 living veterans who have received the 
Purple Heart Medal, I ask you to join me in honoring his service, and 
the work of all men and women in uniform who have shed blood in the 
service of our country.
