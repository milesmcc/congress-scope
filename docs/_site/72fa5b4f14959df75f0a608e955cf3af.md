Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Captain 
Robert Vallejo II who was killed on September 18, 2008, while serving 
our country.

Captain Robert Vallejo II was a captain in Texas National Guard. He 
and six other Guard members lost their lives while on duty aboard


a Chinook helicopter near Tallil, Iraq. The soldiers were assigned to 
the 2nd Battalion, 149th Aviation, 36th Combat Aviation Brigade based 
in Grand Prairie, Texas. Captain Robert Vallejo II will be remembered 
for his commendable and selfless service to this great nation.

Captain Robert Vallejo was born in Beeville, Texas, and later moved 
to Fort Worth. He was a member of the ROTC program at Texas Christian 
University, where he graduated in 2005 with a Communication Studies 
degree before being accepted to flight school at Fort Rucker, Alabama. 
He dreamed of being a pilot and he put his passion into practice when 
he joined the Texas National Guard.

Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize such a brave man as Robert 
Vallejo II. I am proud to have had the chance to represent him in 
Congress. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of 
this American hero.
