# TRIBUTE TO SENATORS
## `3a5e6db2edb5fa296fefd55cabe38213`
`Mr. KERRY â€” 1 October 2008`

---


Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to speak today about my 
good friend and colleague, John Warner, who it has been an honor to 
serve with in the Senate for almost 25 years.

At age 17, John enlisted in the Navy to serve our country during 
World War II. After that, he attended Washington and Lee University on 
the GI bill and went on to study law at the University of Virginia. In 
1950, he interrupted his legal education to deploy to Korea as a 
marine, eventually attaining the rank of captain before receiving his 
law degree in 1953. Sixteen years later, John was appointed Under 
Secretary of the Navy, and in 1972 rose to become Secretary of the 
Navy. In 1978, the people of Virginia elected him their Senator, and he 
has represented them and the rest of our country with courage and 
dedication for over 30 years.

In particular, John has fought relentlessly for our men and women in 
uniform in his leadership role as chairman and ranking member of the 
Armed Services Committee. He has always had a special place in his 
heart for our country's veterans. His background as a sailor, marine, 
and Navy Secretary gave him the experience and insight needed to 
address extraordinarily complicated and wide-ranging issues of vital 
importance to our country's defense. Today he is recognized by all as 
one of our country's foremost experts on national security matters, and 
someone whose record of bipartisanship is simply unmatched.

That is a legend's biography, and through it courses the public 
virtues of service, patriotism, grace and high-mindedness in a way few 
have seen, but I know many will read about.

On a personal note, one of my fondest memories of John was of a 
debate between us that occurred on the Senate floor. It was late one 
night in June 2006, and I had proposed a resolution setting a deadline 
on our combat presence in Iraq that wasn't a popular position at that 
time. I was clearly outnumbered, and the debate became heated and 
personal. In fact, my plan received only 13 votes, and Senator Warner 
wasn't one of them.

But even in times of disagreement, John had no trouble rising above 
partisan bickering in service of a higher purpose. In the best 
traditions and practices of the Senate, he rose to speak and engaged me 
in a respectful and substantive dialogue on a controversial issue that 
calmed the Senate chamber and I hope informed the American public.

I want to close by saying that I, the people of Virginia and this 
country are grateful for John's distinguished service and will miss him 
dearly. I wish him and his family my very best and look forward to 
continuing to receive his wise counsel in the years ahead.

















Chuck Hagel


Mr. President, for the past 12 years, I have had the privilege of 
serving in the Senate with my friend Chuck Hagel. Upon his retirement 
from the Senate, I wanted to take a moment to tell him how much he will 
be dearly missed. Chuck Hagel will be missed not just by his colleagues 
in the Senate, but also by those Americans for whom he is dedicated his 
career to fight while serving in Washington, DC.

Although we sit on opposite sides of the aisle, I have found myself 
standing with Senator Hagel on numerous occasions. Just in the past 
couple of years, we have fought for increased pay for our troops, 
establishing a center dedicated to the rehabilitation, treatment, and 
research of servicemembers blinded in combat, and advocating for 
additional mental health care resources for servicemembers returning 
from combat.

Because of Senator Hagel's dedication to stand up for those who have 
fought for our country, we have a modernized GI bill. We have a GI bill 
that more accurately reflects the sacrifices that our men and women in 
uniform are making. A modernized benefits package that will cover the 
majority of tuition costs for our returning servicemembers, and I was 
proud to stand with him in that effort as well.

His service to our country has been truly admirable. Senator Hagel 
has had a truly remarkable career representing the State of Nebraska. I 
thank him for his service to our country. I wish him the best in his 
future endeavors.

















John Warner
