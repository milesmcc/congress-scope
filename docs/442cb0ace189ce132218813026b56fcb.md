Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we know a college degree and a highly 
skilled labor force are the keys to increasing earnings and to 
Americans' competitiveness around the world.

When the Senate HELP Committee began work on the reauthorization of 
the Higher Education Act, my main priority at the time was to ensure 
that more students could access and afford college and job training.

Taken as a package, S. 1762--the Higher Education Access Act that we 
passed early Friday morning--and S. 1642--the Higher Education 
Amendments Act--that we are debating today--truly accomplish these 
goals and more.

Early Friday morning, the Senate increased the maximum Pell grant 
award to assist low-income students to go to college or to get job 
training. Then we added additional funding for the neediest of low-
income students.

I am also very proud that we authorized and appropriated $226 million 
for the College Access Partnership Grant Program. This is a partnership 
between the Federal Government and the States to help more young 
Americans prepare for, apply to, and succeed in college.

We also did good work in the bill in protecting borrower benefits 
that are provided by State agency and nonprofit lenders.

In Alaska, we have a State agency lender that uses their special 
allowance payments, or their SAP payments, to reduce the loan interest 
rates to the lowest in the Nation. They provide outreach and college 
early awareness to middle and high school students. They provide need-
based grants and other very important benefits.

Alaska's State agency, nonprofit lender, and others like it in States 
such as Wyoming, Tennessee, and North Carolina, are not plowing their 
SAP rate into their profit margin. I am gratified the Senate was able 
to recognize the good work the State of Alaska and many other States 
are doing.

Also in the legislation, we ensured that young Americans will not be 
saddled with unmanageable amounts of debt after they graduate.

It is these and other provisions in S. 1762 that go hand in hand with 
the bill we are debating today, and which I am hopeful we will see 
passage of by tonight.

This bill, S. 1642--the Higher Education Amendments of 2007--includes 
many important and beneficial provisions that will ensure that 
students, parents, and American taxpayers get the fairest deal, the 
best information, and truly the biggest bang for their buck.

This legislation makes the cost of college more transparent so 
parents and students can compare the costs of different colleges to 
determine which ones will most effectively and affordably meet their 
needs.

It places prohibitions on unauthorized entities using students' loan 
and grant information for marketing purposes. It provides fair, 
sensible, and rigorous ethics reform for financial aid administrators 
and lenders to ensure that the students receive the information they 
need to make decisions that will benefit them and not benefit 
unscrupulous lenders or postsecondary institutions.

Title II of the bill streamlines and strengthens Teacher Quality 
Enhancement grants to bring more accountability to university teacher 
training programs. It also directs the Secretary to further simplify 
the FAFSA the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. When we were 
talking on the floor last week about the FAFSA application, the Senator 
from Wyoming held up that eight-page application and demonstrated what 
it is the students are faced with when they take this on.

I am particularly proud of one provision that I worked to include in 
S. 1642. This provision makes it easier for servicemembers--
particularly those in the lowest ranks--and their spouses to afford 
college.

I was in my State at Fort Richardson last winter, and I was visiting 
with some of the wives of the servicemen deployed to Iraq and 
Afghanistan. I asked them in this townhall meeting: What is it that I 
can do to help you as you wait for your loved one to return home? How 
can we make your lives better? We talked about quality-of-life 
initiatives. We talked about greater certainty with deployments. But 
one of the wives told me that during this time when her husband was 
deployed for 15 months, she was trying to take advantage of this time 
period to better herself by going on to college. She told me that one 
of the things keeping her from being able to afford to go to college 
was that the money the military pays to help offset a portion of their 
housing costs, which is counted toward their income, this allowance 
prevented her from being eligible for a Pell grant. Now, given the low 
rate of pay for many members of the military, particularly those in the 
lowest ranks, this is also a barrier for them in being able to take out 
student loans.

I soon found out from the National Military Families Association that 
many military spouses are in this same position. So when I came back to 
the Capitol, I worked to include language in S. 1642 that would exclude 
the cost of the basic allowance for housing for servicemembers living 
off base, as well as the value of on-base housing, from being included 
in calculations for financial need.

Excluding the basic allowance for housing--which, in the vast 
majority of cases, does not completely cover military families' housing 
costs--and the value of on-base housing will benefit the least well-
paid members of our military and their spouses. These are privates, 
they are seamen's apprentices, lance corporals, airmen, and corporals 
whose base pay is less than $35,000 a year. As those who are deployed 
and serving our country, we can help the spouses who perhaps are here 
and looking to better themselves during this period of time as they 
wait for their loved ones to return home. This is a true benefit for 
them.

I could not be more proud to know that this strong woman whom I met 
last year and potentially thousands like her will have a better chance 
now of being able to attend college should we be successful in passing 
this legislation.

Overall, I believe we did a fine job in making college and job 
training more accessible and more affordable. I would like to thank my 
colleagues, especially Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, for their 
generosity and their graciousness throughout this long process and 
their true dedication toward the goal of educating all of America's 
young people.

I yield the floor.
