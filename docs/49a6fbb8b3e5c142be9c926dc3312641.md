Mr. SKELTON. All you have to do, Mr. Chairman, is read the amendment. 
This amendment does not preclude any effort of expending funds from the 
base Defense authorization appropriation. This merely makes sure that 
the moneys meant for Afghanistan, meant for Iraq, go to those soldiers, 
marines, sailors and airmen there. It is that simple.

As my old law school professor once said: read it. What does it say?
