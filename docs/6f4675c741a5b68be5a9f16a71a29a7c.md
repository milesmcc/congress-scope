Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker, it is easy in the era where we look at the 
big numbers and the headlines in the newspaper to forget about the 
great acts of heroism that are going on right this very moment in Iraq 
and elsewhere in our world. I rise to bring to the attention of this 
body the heroism of Lieutenant Patrick Dowdell. He is serving with the 
4th Infantry in Iraq as we speak. That is a division that has lost, 
unfortunately, over 135 heroic men and women. He is not the only hero 
in the family. His younger brother, James, recently began service in 
Ladder Company 174 in East Flatbush. I hope you will join with me and 
all of his neighbors in Breezy Point in expressing tribute to this 
family.

This family has one other chapter of heroism in its book. Lieutenant 
Kevin Dowdell, the father of both Patrick and James, was lost on 
September 11, a firefighter, in the World Trade Center. We join with 
this entire body and all of this country in commending Rose Ellen, 
their mother, and the acts of heroism that they are paying both here 
and in generations in the past. May God bless them, and God bless the 
United States of America.
