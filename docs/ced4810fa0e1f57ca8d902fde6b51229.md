Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the gentleman's comments.

I will say that Congresswoman Herseth Sandlin has worked very hard on 
that. I'm sure Mr. Boozman has as well. The committee has addressed 
that bill. It's a good bill. It's not as extensive, as you know, as the 
Webb bill, which has also been worked on pretty hard by former 
Secretary of the Navy Webb, Jim Webb, the Senator from Virginia. Both 
bills obviously seek to make sure that our warriors who come back, 
those who have defended freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan, that when they 
come back, we invest in their education so they, in turn, can grow our 
economy and our country and do what the veterans of World War II did. 
But we're looking at those and they're under discussion.
