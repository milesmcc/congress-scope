`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 25 February 2008`

---


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an American hero 
who was killed on February 17, 2008, in Diyala Province, Iraq, while 
supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. His bravery and selflessness will 
not be forgotten. I extend my thoughts and prayers to his wife 
Stephanie, his daughter Clarissa, and all his family and friends.

Chad Groepper was raised in Kingsley, IA, and graduated from 
Kingsley-Pierson Community High School in 2004. He enlisted shortly 
after his graduation. Chad was known for his ability to put smiles on 
faces, make people laugh, and for being involved with outside sports 
such as dirt biking and


four-wheeling. He met his wife while stationed at Fort Lewis, WA, and 
their daughter is only 4 months old.

Specialist Groepper was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters 
Company, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division 
out of Fort Lewis, WA. He will be remembered for his courageous 
sacrifice and energetic personality. Kingsley mayor Wayne Plendl 
describes Groepper as ''a nice, nice young man who was highly thought 
of.'' He will be greatly missed. I ask my colleagues here in the Senate 
and all Americans to remember with gratitude and appreciation a heroic 
soldier, SPC Chad D. Groepper.
