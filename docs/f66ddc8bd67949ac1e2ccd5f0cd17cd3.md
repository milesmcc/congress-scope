`Mr. REID â€” 18 December 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment.

Mr. President, there is a proverb from the Book of Matthew that says: 
''For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.''

In the past few weeks, as we have put together the budget that is now 
before us, Democrats have sought to put our hearts and our treasure 
where the American people need them most.

President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress have been 
determined from the start to stand in our way.

The President picked a top line budget number out of thin air and 
said he would veto any bill that invested another dime above this total 
in the needs of the American people--no matter how many children, 
students, working families veterans or senior citizens would be harmed.

This from the President who inherited record surpluses when he took 
office and turned them into record deficits.

This from the President who has spent nearly $500 billion--all of it 
borrowed--to fight a war of choice in Iraq, while ignoring the 
desperate needs that we face here at home.

And this from congressional Republicans who have rubber-stamped his 
every irresponsible, wasteful, reckless choice.

But now, this year, this President and these Bush-Cheney Republicans


claim--after years leading our country down a path of fiscal ruin--they 
have been baptized into the church of fiscal responsibility.

Under this false pretense, they went about to prevent us from 
presenting appropriations bills that help America's working families.

With the power of the President's veto and a core group of 
congressional Republicans willing to back it up, this fight has not 
been easy. That is an understatement.

Nevertheless, in the past few weeks, we have worked within the 
President's arbitrary top line to make it clear to the American people 
where our hearts and our fiscal priorities lie.

Every victory in the appropriations bills now before us--every 
benefit to working families, every investment in our Nation's future--
we have had to fight for, tooth and nail.

Bush-Cheney Republicans turned their backs on medical science in this 
budget.

They tried to cut 800 grants for medical research at the National 
Institutes of Health--programs that would help find cures for dread 
diseases.

Our Democratic priorities are different.

We want to spread hope--real scientific hope--that those who suffer 
from Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's and diabetes and other maladies 
will see a brighter, healthier day.

So we restored the Bush-Cheney Republican cuts to the NIH and 
invested more than $600 million in medical research.

We refused to back down and we won that fight.

The Bush-Cheney Republican budget would have slashed access to health 
care by $600 million--leaving many of the most vulnerable Americans 
with nowhere to turn.

But our Democratic priorities are different.

We believe in helping the little girl with asthma, for whom the 
emergency room is a revolving door because her parents can't afford a 
doctor; or the uninsured laborer who gets injured on the job; or the 
senior citizen who suffers from arthritis.

We gave these Americans a better chance to live healthy lives--with 
$1 billion above the President's request for programs like community 
health centers, high risk insurance pools and rural hospitals--programs 
on which hundreds of thousands of low-income Americans rely.

We refused to back down on America's health care needs, and we won 
that fight.

If the Bush-Cheney Republicans got their way, this budget would have 
stripped $1.2 billion from education, eliminated major student aid 
programs and cut vocational education by 50 percent.

But Democrats have different priorities here, too.

We believe that education is the great equalizer in America, and that 
every American child deserves the right to a quality education and the 
keys to a better future.

We backed that commitment with major investments in Title 1, special 
education, teacher quality grants, after school programs, Head Start, 
student aid grants and technical training--all above the Bush-Cheney 
Republican request.

Democrats refused to back down and let Republicans rob children of 
the chance to succeed, and we won that fight.

Bush-Cheney Republicans talk tough on law enforcement, but when it 
came time to actually give our State and local law enforcement the 
tools they need to keep us safe, Bush-Cheney Republicans said no.

Their budget cut law enforcement funds by $1.4 billion at the 
Department of Justice.

Once again, Democrats' priorities are different. We invested $1.2 
billion more than the President's request to help our police fight 
crime.

We refused to back down from our commitment to safer neighborhoods, 
and we won that fight.

Bush-Cheney Republicans try hard to scare us with the threat of 
terrorism. Did their budget match their rhetoric? No.

They cut more than $1 billion in homeland security grants for police, 
firefighters and medical personnel.

What are our priorities? Democrats increased our commitment to 
fighting terrorism by nearly $2 billion.

We refused to believe that at a time we are spending $12 billion a 
month in Iraq and Afghanistan, we couldn't spend an additional $2 
billion per year to fight terrorism in America.

We won that fight, too, and America will be safer because of it.

The same year when the Minneapolis bridge collapse tragically 
reminded us that our roads, bridges and tunnels are crumbling, Bush-
Cheney Republicans tried to strip critical infrastructure projects from 
the budget.

Democrats refused to stand by while the President spends billions to 
build roads in Iraq, but tells us we can't do anything about our roads 
in America.

We can do something and we did. We refused to back down and we won 
the fight for American infrastructure.

When it came time to choose between energy independence and big oil, 
between a clean environment and the special interests, the Bush-Cheney 
Republicans chose the special interests.

Our priorities are consumers who are spending more than ever to pay 
for gas for their cars and heat for their homes.

We take the side of cleaner air and renewable fuels by investing in 
solar energy, wind energy, biofuels and energy efficiency.

We stood up to Bush-Cheney Republicans, who once again turned their 
backs on science and cozied up to the major polluters.

We won that fight, and America will be safer and cleaner because we 
did.

I am so grateful for my Democratic colleagues in the House and 
Senate.

We have faced a level of arbitrary stubbornness from President Bush 
and his congressional allies that no Congress has ever faced before.

We turned a horrible budget into a budget that does some good, 
important things.

And we did it responsibly: without raising taxes or adding anything 
to President Bush's epic pile of debt.

Our country owes enormous gratitude to the senior Senator from West 
Virginia, Chairman Robert Byrd, for his leadership on this budget.

Chairman Obey also did a tremendous job on this legislation.

I would also like to acknowledge the work of Senator Cochran, who 
worked with Senator Byrd and others to move this bill through committee 
and to the floor.

This budget includes funds to help prevent Western wildfires and 
better fight the ones that do occur.

It includes vital education funding for Nevada's universities.

It invests in Nevada's renewable energy.

It provides funds for vital Nevada water projects.

And it honors our troops and veterans with more than $340 million for 
the southern Nevada veteran's hospital.

But let me be clear: this compromise budget could have been much, 
much better if not for Bush-Cheney Republicans' double standard on 
fiscal responsibility.

They chose to enforce an arbitrary topline on America's priorities--
even as they continue to borrow billions to fund the endless war in 
Iraq, to support corporate cronyism, and to look the other way on 
global warming and pollution.

Because Republicans have made these choices, the American people will 
have to keep waiting for the kind of budget they deserve.

But because Democrats refused to back down, this budget is a step 
forward.

The American people deserve to know that Democrats will keep taking 
step after step after step to set the right priorities and make the 
progress that our country so desperately needs.

Mr. President, as things now stand, we have about 20 minutes of 
talking on the Republican side and we have Senator Byrd, who has less 
than 10 minutes on our side. Those are the only speeches I know of.
