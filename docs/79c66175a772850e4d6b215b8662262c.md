`Mr. EMANUEL â€” 8 March 2007`

---


Mr. EMANUEL. I thank my colleague.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the distinguished Members who 
participated in this tribute and this honor, both those from last year 
and those who participated tonight.

I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of my colleagues to 
thank the brave men and women who continue to serve our Nation in Iraq 
and Afghanistan and throughout the world and serve with distinction and 
honor. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families at 
this time until they come together.

As I said this afternoon, in the words of President Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, ''Each of these heroes stands in the unbroken line of 
patriots who dare to die that freedom might live and grow and increase 
in its blessings.''

A number of our colleagues have stumbled over the names; I hope those 
families understand that. Although we struggle with the names, we honor 
their service.

I continue to place the names and pictures of those who have given 
their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan outside


my office in the Longworth Building. These faces and these names and 
their rank serve as a stark reminder to me and those who pass by my 
office that there are young men and women who have given their lives 
for our country, and we need to stop and remember their sacrifices and 
the sacrifices of their family, to thank them and honor them. May we 
always remember them, their names and their faces. God bless them, and 
God bless America.
