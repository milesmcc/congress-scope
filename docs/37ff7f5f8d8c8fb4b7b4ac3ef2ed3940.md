# IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL

Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, the Iraq supplemental will be coming to 
the floor this week, and it brings together many of the recommendations 
that we have heard from the nonpartisan Iraq Study Group, from the 
Pentagon and the President himself, but it provides more resources for 
our troops in the field and when they come home, and finally provides 
accountability for this administration.

First, the legislation demands that the Iraqi Government meet 
benchmarks the President himself outlined earlier this year.

Second, the legislation calls for responsible redeployment out of 
Iraq at the beginning of next year. The Democratic Congress did not 
come up with this date out of the blue. This was in the recommendations 
from the Iraq Study Group.

Third, the supplemental includes important funding for our military 
that was requested by the Pentagon.

This week marks an important milestone to begin a new direction in 
Iraq and begin to phase our troops home, and to bring about a regional 
solution for what is going on in the Middle East.
