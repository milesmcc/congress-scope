# JARED C. MONTI: AMERICAN HERO
## `6da14db5d536f6da1edc8eb4b74dcf78`
`Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts â€” 9 September 2009`

---


Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, the hardest part of our 
job is attending the funerals of those young men and women who have 
given their lives in the service of our country. Having voted to send 
American military forces into war in Afghanistan, I was profoundly 
moved--and troubled--when I attend the funeral of Sergeant Jared C. 
Monti of Raynham, Massachusetts, who lost his life in a brave effort to 
save a comrade in that country. These occasions are for us an important 
reminder that voting to send people to war is a last resort done only 
after the most thorough and thoughtful consideration, and only when no 
alternative is consistent with our security.

But Madam Speaker, to talk about the difficulty of our jobs in the 
context of the death in battle of this brave young man is an example of 
grave disproportion. For me, this was a sad day. For the family of 
Jared Monti, it was part of a period of deep and enduring sadness, and 
of course with Sergeant Monti himself it was the ultimate tragedy--a 
promising young life lost.

Madam Speaker, in the Boston Globe for Sunday, September 6, Bryan 
Bender of the Globe staff wrote a moving, eloquent article about 
Sergeant Monti, describing the battle in which he was killed as he with 
no regard for his own safety tried to save a wounded comrade. Next week 
I will be at the White House when Sergeant Monti's family receives the 
Medal of Honor that was posthumously awarded to him. Madam Speaker, as 
a tribute to an extraordinary young man, whose dedication to his 
comrades was unlimited, and as a reminder of what war really means to 
those who must fight it, I ask that Mr. Bender's excellent, sad article 
be printed here.

He Could Not Leave a Comrade Behind














 (By Bryan Bender)




 The sound of feet shuffling in the woods, high on a ridge 


 in remote Afghanistan, was the only warning that Sergeant 


 Jared C. Monti and the 15 men under his command were about to 


 be attacked. Before they could even react, they were 


 bombarded with rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun 


 fire.



 The ambush by mountain tribesmen allied with the Taliban 


 came so suddenly and with such ferocity that some members of 


 Monti's unit ''had their weapons literally shot out of their 


 hands,'' according to an Army report.



 Monti, a 30-year-old staff sergeant from Raynham, shouted 


 orders and radioed for support as he found cover behind some 


 large rocks. An officer a few miles away asked whether he 


 could pinpoint the enemy's position.



 ''Sir, I can't give you a better read or I'm gonna eat an 


 RPG,'' Monti replied.



 But later, when one of his men was wounded and lying in the 


 open, Monti braved intense fire to try to rescue him--not 


 once, but three times. It cost him his life.



 Three years later, after an Army review of Monti's actions 


 that day, President Obama will award him the Medal of Honor, 


 the highest recognition for valor in the US military. When 


 Monti's parents, Paul and Janet, accept the award in a White 


 House ceremony on Sept. 17, it will be only the sixth time 


 the Medal of Honor has been awarded since Sept. 11, 2001, and 


 the first time someone from Massachusetts has earned it since 


 the Vietnam War.



 Monti's story reveals not just the courageous actions of a 


 12-year Army veteran. It also illustrates the extreme 


 conditions of combat in Afghanistan, where increasing numbers 


 of US forces are dying, and the sheer chaos of the war.



 Everything went wrong for Monti and his patrol. The unit 


 was left on that narrow ridge longer than intended, exposing 


 it to a much larger enemy. And while Monti's display of 


 ''extreme personal courage and extraordinary self-


 sacrifice,'' as the Army described it, helped turn the tide, 


 disaster struck again when the soldier Monti tried to save 


 was killed in a freak accident while being airlifted out. 


 Including Monti, four soldiers died.



 ''True valor is not defined so much by results,'' an Army 


 general wrote in recommending Monti for the medal, ''as it is 


 by




 the depth of conviction that inspires its expression. On rare 


 occasions, the actions of men are so extraordinary that the 


 nobility rests, not in their outcome, but in the courage of 


 their undertaking.''














 ''He was very humble''




 When Charlie Witkus learned his buddy Jared had been 


 killed, he organized a ''Viking'' funeral.



 After his burial at the Massachusetts National Cemetery in 


 Bourne, Monti's friends collected cards, letters, and other 


 mementos of him and set them ablaze on a makeshift pyre 


 floating on a Taunton pond.



 It was a fitting tribute, Witkus felt, for a guy who once 


 organized a ''survival style'' canoe trip down the Taunton 


 River, with no food or water.



 ''I was devastated,'' said Witkus, who last spoke with his 


 friend about three weeks before he died. ''He was the most 


 stand-up guy I ever knew.''



 Monti was born in Abington and grew up in Raynham, 35 miles 


 south of Boston, the son of a schoolteacher and a nurse.



 Stories of his generous spirit abound: As a youngster he 


 made lunches for his brother and sister to help his mom get 


 to nursing school on time. During his high school years, he 


 once cut down a spruce tree in their yard to give to a single 


 mother who could not afford a Christmas tree for her kids. He 


 even collected enough money for gifts.



 But he rarely took credit for his deeds, relatives and 


 friends said. Only after he died did his father, Paul, find a 


 3-foot tall trophy Jared won in a weight-lifting 


 championship.



 ''That is the way he was,'' said Paul Monti. ''He was very 


 humble. He believed in doing things for other people.''



 To honor his son's memory, Paul Monti has established an 


 annual scholarship fund for a Raynham senior headed to 


 college.



 He also finds comfort driving Jared's pickup, still covered 


 with stickers from his beloved 10th Mountain Division.



 Jared set his sights on the military early, inspired by an 


 uncle in the Navy. He joined the Massachusetts National 


 Guard's delayed entry program in 11th grade at Bridgewater-


 Raynham Regional High School, attending weekend drills at the 


 recruiting station in Taunton until he graduated.



 ''I wanted to be that same person,'' he later wrote of how 


 the image of his uncle's crisp uniform captured his 


 imagination.
















 A steady hand




 Monti was not a perfect soldier, but he proved that he 


 could earn the trust and respect of those he led; he called 


 them his ''boys,'' and some of them called him ''grandpa.''



 When he left for basic training in Missouri in 1993, barely 


 18 years old, he had never been out of Massachusetts. Army 


 life was tough, he recalled, but he adjusted quickly and 


 eventually decided to enlist full time. He was disappointed 


 other soldiers didn't take it as seriously--a feeling he 


 later expressed in his own words in a journal his family 


 found on his computer after his death.



 ''I wanted to fight for my country at a time when everybody 


 else was smoking weed and or just there to earn a couple of 


 bucks toward college,'' he wrote.



 He got into several bar fights, including with one of his 


 sergeants in Kansas who ridiculed him by calling him 


 ''Rambo,'' and he did 14 days of hard labor for violating a 


 weekend pass when he was stationed in South Korea in the 


 1990s. ''I drank till there was no tomorrow,'' he wrote of 


 the incident.



 But as he rose through the enlisted ranks, his superiors 


 quickly saw he had a steadiness and maturity that others 


 didn't. Monti was one of the first enlisted soldiers in the 


 82nd Airborne Division selected to be trained to call in air 


 strikes on enemy positions, an enormous responsibility that 


 brought the risk of civilian casualties.



 ''If a lot of guys were just sitting around, he was always 


 willing to teach us something,'' recalled Sergeant Clifford 


 Baird, who first met Monti, with his ever-present chewing 


 tobacco tucked under his lip, when they were posted together 


 at Fort Drum, N.Y. ''He'd sit there and give us a class. He 


 was very respected around here.''



 Monti also had a special bond with junior soldiers. While 


 soldiers are required to shave every day, even in the field, 


 Monti would let his beard grow and shave only before 


 returning to base. The new guys loved that he would bend the 


 rules like that.



 And he was as loyal to his men as they were to him. He once 


 gave up his leave to fill in for a soldier who hadn't seen 


 his family in two years. When stationed at Fort Bragg in 


 North Carolina, he gave his new kitchen set to a soldier 


 whose kids were eating on the floor. When his girlfriend, 


 Sherri, sent care packages with his favorite cigars, he would 


 promptly hand them out to his unit.



 ''One of the things that sets him apart was that he had a 


 great deal of compassion,'' said Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey 


 Abbott, the operations officer for Monti's squadron in 


 Afghanistan.
















 A heavy burden




 He earned a chestful of medals, but Monti agonized over all 


 the killing war required, his family said. He returned from 


 Afghanistan in 2003 with a Bronze Star for valor, but his 


 mother recalled: ''He didn't like talking about it. Most of 


 the time he just liked to be left alone. He'd say, 'Don't 


 tell anybody I am here.' He wasn't proud of it.''



 When he was pressed about how he earned it, Janet Monti 


 said, he'd finally blurt out something like, ''I had to kill 


 someone's brother, or father, or sister.''



 Monti described his private anxieties in an undated entry, 


 titled ''My story,'' that his father recently found on his 


 personal computer. ''We are not fighting in World War II,'' 


 Monti wrote. ''We don't have the ability to justify any means 


 to our end. Wars of today are not black and white.''



 Monti's job to call in air strikes ''weighed heavily on 


 him,'' said Jon Krakauer, a mountaineer and author of the 


 best-seller ''Into Thin Air'' who, while working on a book, 


 spent nearly five weeks with Monti's unit.



 ''It was always this tough call,'' Krakauer said. ''He was 


 conservative about it.''



 Krakauer recalled a patrol with Monti when a Toyota Corolla 


 came barreling down the road. Fearing the driver was a 


 suicide bomber, a soldier prepared to open fire. But Monti 


 stopped him just in time. It turned out the driver was just a 


 local in a hurry.



 ''A split-second later it would have been really bad,'' 


 said Krakauer.



 It was Monti's humanity that also helped him get along 


 especially well with the locals, Krakauer said. He was called 


 on frequently to negotiate, through an interpreter, with 


 tribal leaders, who liked him so much they gave him a Muslim 


 name.



 ''He was only 30-years-old but he was an old soul,'' said 


 Krakauer.














''Worst-case scenario''




 The nearly 300 members of the 3rd Squadron, 71st Calvary 


 Regiment had a grueling mission; they lost an average of 15 


 to 20 percent of their body weight, pulling 16- to 18-hour 


 days, seven days a week, often in 100-plus degree 


 temperatures.



 In one of the longest maneuvers in recent US military 


 history, they trekked by Humvee along dirt paths and steep 


 mountain passes from a US base in southern Afghanistan to 


 remote Nuristan province in the northeast, about the distance 


 between New York and Washington, D.C.



 ''We moved into unknown terrain,'' recalled Abbott, the 


 squadron's operations officer, noting even the Soviet army 


 did not venture there during its brutal occupation of 


 Afghanistan in the 1980s.



 ''Sergeant Monti went out with reconnaissance teams to 


 learn the people,'' he said, ''to learn the populace, and to 


 gain knowledge of a terrain that nobody had ever been 


 employed in before.''



 Monti's last mission was to scout Taliban positions near 


 infiltration routes from neighboring Pakistan--mainly goat 


 trails thousands of feet up--and gather targeting data for a 


 larger offensive, dubbed Operation Gowardesh after the nearby 


 town, to take place a few days later.



 On the evening of June 17, 2006, the patrol was ferried by 


 helicopter a few miles from the town. To avoid detection and 


 the sweltering heat, they moved mostly in the dark, using 


 night-vision equipment to navigate the rugged terrain.



 On June 20, they stopped on a narrow ridge overlooking the 


 Gremen Valley, with steep inclines on both sides, that 


 commanded a view of several enemy positions.



 The 16 soldiers set up their observation post on a sloping 


 patch of ground, about 165 feet long and 65 feet wide, with a 


 tree line at the top end and a few large rocks, a portion of 


 an old stone wall, and a few small trees at the lower end, 


 according to the Army's recreation of the battle.



 The next morning Monti was informed that the larger US 


 assault would be delayed for three days--the helicopters and 


 troops were needed elsewhere--leaving them low on food and 


 water. The plan had been to use the cover of the US assault 


 to resupply them by helicopter; now the resupply could expose 


 them to the enemy.



 At about 1:30 p.m., Monti took most of the patrol to meet a 


 resupply helicopter about 500 feet away. A small group stayed 


 behind. They soon spotted a local man down in the valley 


 using military-style binoculars to look up toward their 


 position before he picked up a satchel and disappeared.



 ''It was the worst-case scenario,'' said former Army 


 Captain Ross A. Berkoff, the squadron's intelligence officer, 


 who was monitoring the situation from about 6 miles away. 


 ''We stirred up a hornet's nest.''














well-coordinated attack




 When the enemy fighters opened fire on the patrol just 


 before nightfall, the two soldiers nearest the woods bolted 


 down the slope to seek cover behind rocks.



 Sergeant Patrick Lybert, 28, of Ladysmith, Wis., was 


 crouched behind a low stone wall, in the best position to 


 fire back. The others could barely raise their heads to aim.



 The patrol faced between 60 and 80 fighters, most of them 


 members of Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, a local tribal militia 


 aligned with the Taliban, according to Berkoff.



 Monti calmly reported over the radio that the patrol was at 


 risk of being overrun, according to officers in the 


 operations center a few miles away. As shoulder-launched RPGs 


 (rocket-propelled grenades) skipped off the rocks right above 


 his head, he began plotting grid coordinates for another 


 group of soldiers on another ridge to fire mortar shells at 


 the advancing fighters.



 Within minutes, Lybert, who had been holding off the enemy 


 from behind the stone wall, slumped forward, blood coming out 


 of his ears.



 The tribal militia split into two groups to try to encircle 


 the patrol. Soldiers who still had weapons passed them back 


 and forth to the one in the best position to fire back.



 The enemy ''had one goal in mind,'' said Abbott, who was 


 monitoring the battle from the command post. ''To overrun and 


 kill everybody in Monti's squad.''





 Monti saw a group of fighters closing in fast. When they 


 came within 30 feet, he threw a grenade in their path. He 


 then took a head count. Private Brian Bradbury, who had been 


 near the tree line, was missing.
















 a dark ending




 Monti called out for him over the din of the battle. He 


 called again. Finally, the 22-year-old from Lowville, N.Y., 


 replied weakly that he was badly injured and couldn't move. 


 He was lying about 30 feet away, where Monti couldn't see 


 him, but directly in the enemy's sights.



 Monti told Bradbury he was coming to get him. He handed off 


 his radio, tightened the chin strap of his helmet, and ran 


 out into the open. The woods, about 100 feet past Bradbury, 


 immediately erupted with more gunfire and RPGs.



 Moving low and fast, according to the testimony of his 


 fellow soldiers, Monti got within less than a dozen feet of 


 Bradbury before he had to dive behind the low stone wall 


 where Lybert lay dead. After a brief pause, he made another 


 attempt but the shooting was even more intense. He scrambled 


 back behind the low wall.



 He prepared to make another attempt to save Bradbury, this 


 time asking some of his men to cover him with more gun fire 


 trained on the woods. But as he lunged toward Bradbury the 


 third time, an RPG exploded in his path.



 The blast blew off his legs, but Monti struggled to get 


 back to the stone wall, his men calling out in encouragement. 


 With his last breaths, his soldiers later reported, Monti 


 said he made his peace with God. And right before he died he 


 asked them to tell his family he loved them.



 As darkness fell over the valley, the mortar rounds Monti 


 called for began to hit the enemy positions. US aircraft also 


 dropped several bombs into the woods.



 ''Monti's selfless act of courage rallied the patrol to 


 defeat the enemy attack,'' the Army concluded.



 It was dark by the time Bradbury was pulled to safety and 


 treated by the medic. A helicopter arrived but couldn't land 


 because of the rough terrain. Staff Sergeant Heathe Craig, 


 28, a medic from Severn, Md., was lowered to Bradbury, who 


 had a team of doctors waiting to treat him back at the base. 


 But as they were being hoisted up, the winch broke. Both fell 


 to their deaths.



 Berkoff remembered standing in front of the field hospital 


 and thinking, ''Could anything possibly go right today?''



 Monti was posthumously promoted to sergeant first class.



 As she prepares to accept the Medal of Honor from the 


 president for her son's sacrifice, Janet Monti says she can't 


 help but wonder what Jared would think about it. ''He would 


 say this medal isn't just for me. He would want to share this 


 medal with everybody who died that day.''
