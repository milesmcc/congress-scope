Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of PFC 
Joshua S. Modgling who died on Tuesday June 19, 2007, of injuries 
sustained in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Private First Class Modgling had been in Iraq since May and was 
assigned to the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry 
Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia. PFC Modgling was killed while 
conducting missions out of Forward Operating Base Falcon when an 
improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle in Muhammad al 
AIi, Iraq.

PFC Modgling was raised in Las Vegas Valley and attended Manch 
Elementary School and Silverado High School. During his youth, Joshua 
played Pop Warner football and set a record for the most sacks. Private 
First Class Modgling was a hero whose desire to serve his country will 
forever make an impact on his family, his community and his country. He 
joined the United States Army to serve his country in the Global War on 
Terror. He will not only be remembered for his sacrifice and willing 
service, but for the extraordinary person that he was. His warmth and 
optimism brightened the lives of his family and friends.

Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of PFC Joshua S. 
Modgling. His heroism and sacrifice for his country while fighting the 
Global War on Terror are the highest tribute to the democracy and 
freedom we hold so dear.
