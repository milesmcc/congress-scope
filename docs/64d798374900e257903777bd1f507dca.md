Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank especially Chairman 
Skelton for yielding 1 minute. I want to thank Chairman Skelton and 
Ranking Member Hunter for their bipartisan leadership on this bill. I 
am proud to work with them to restore the readiness of our military, 
support our deployed troops and their families, and increase the 
oversight of our ongoing presence in Iraq.

Our National Guard and active duty forces are stretched to the 
breaking point. This bill takes great strides to address this critical 
issue to ensure our Guard are properly trained and equipped to respond 
to threats both home and abroad. Moreover, this legislation includes an 
amendment that I offered with Representative Cummings of Maryland which 
requires General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to report to Congress 
every three months on the status of military operations and political 
reconciliation in Iraq. Such oversight is crucial to our ability to 
find a new way forward in Iraq.

I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation, and I thank 
Chairman Skelton once again for allowing me to speak for 1 minute.
