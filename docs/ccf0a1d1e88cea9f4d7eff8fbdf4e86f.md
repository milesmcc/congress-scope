Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

This past winter, Operation Cast Lead in Israel exercised its right 
as a sovereign nation and its obligation to defend its citizens, and 
its very existence, against attacks by Hamas and other violent 
extremist groups in Gaza.

Israel did so while taking extraordinary measures to minimize the 
risk of civilian casualties. Indeed, as Colonel Richard Kemp, former 
commander of the British forces in Afghanistan, has stated: ''During 
Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli Defense Forces did more to safeguard 
the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the 
history of warfare.''

Then, in January, the Human Rights Council, dominated by 
dictatorships, voted to authorize a so-called fact-finding mission. 
Notably, most free democratic nations did not render their support for 
this sham. The mission's mandate had nothing to do with fact-finding 
and everything to do with persecuting Israel for defending herself. The 
mandate prejudged Israel's guilt, targeted only Israel, and Richard 
Goldstone agreed to head this mission.

Mr. Goldstone claims that he got the Human Rights Council president 
to modify the mandate. Well, my colleagues, just as the Speaker of the 
House cannot unilaterally change a resolution once adopted, neither 
could the president of the council change the mandate without the 
council's approval. Claims of a revised mandate are false since the 
council did not take any action to approve any modifications.

Fast forward to September, Mr. Speaker, when the so-called fact-
finding mission released its report. Indeed, it's a 575-page hatchet 
job commonly known as the Goldstone Report.

While this report contains sweeping accusations that Israel had 
deliberately attacked civilians, in contrast the report disregarded 
evidence that Hamas and other such groups in Gaza used innocents as 
human shields and deliberately launched attacks from schools, from 
hospitals, from mosques. To fully appreciate the Goldstone Report's 
bias, one need only look at the testimony of an Israeli doctor whose 
clinic was hit by a rocket launched from Gaza.

The doctor, who was severely wounded in the attack and had already 
undergone seven operations to address her injuries, says, ''Judge 
Goldstone, in July you invited me to testify. I told you my story.

''I testified in good faith.

''But now I see your report. I have to tell you: I am shocked.

''Judge Goldstone, in a 500-page report, why did you completely 
ignore my story?

''I feel humiliated.

''Why are there only two pages about Israeli victims like me, who 
suffered thousands of rockets over 8 years?

''Why did you choose to focus on the period of my country's response, 
but not on that of the attacks that caused it?''

Mr. Goldstone claims that the report never sought to deny Israel its 
right to self-defense, but the report sought to cast Israel's actions 
in response to rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza, not as carefully 
targeted defensive measures, but as the deliberate infliction of 
violence on civilians.

This is not surprising. The fact-finding mission includes a member 
who, even as the operation was taking place in January of 2009, signed 
a statement entitled, ''Israel's bombardment of Gaza is not self-
defense, it's a war crime.''

Indeed, this statement began by categorically rejecting Israel's 
right to defend herself against such attacks. Further, the words 
''self-defense'' or similar terms never appear in the report. The 
report recommended further action by multiple U.N. bodies, including 
the General Assembly, the Security Council and International Criminal 
Court. The Human Rights Council has already used this report to condemn 
Israel. No surprise there.

Tomorrow, the General Assembly will likely to do the same. As Israel 
is being ostracized at the U.N., violent extremists in Gaza continued 
to fire rockets and mortars at innocent Israelis, 265 of the last 9 
months alone. Just yesterday, militants in Gaza fired another rocket, 
which exploded near an Israeli residential area. No surprise there.

Israel's military intelligence chief testified yesterday that Hamas 
has test-fired a rocket with a 60-kilometer range, far enough to hit 
the Tel Aviv area, threatening up to 3 million Israelis.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
