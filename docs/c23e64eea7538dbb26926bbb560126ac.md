Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chair, I rise to join the ranking member in 
supporting very strongly the amendment from the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).

We have, I think, a general obligation to deal with the issue of the 
refugees as a consequence of these conflicts both in Iraq and in 
Afghanistan, but we have a particularly strong duty to deal with the 
status of people who are displaced or who are objects of persecution, 
retribution or retaliation because those individuals helped either our 
military or our diplomats or our AID people in terms of the conflict in 
either one of those countries.

This is an issue that I, personally, was very involved with in the 
last couple of years. The gentleman's amendment, I think, helps to spur 
us to deal with some of the problems in the program now and to do more 
in this regard. It is certainly an amendment that, if it is passed, I 
would want to see in the final legislation. I urge its adoption.
