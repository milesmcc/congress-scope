Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I take back my time. That is absolutely 
untrue. I have never asked people to trust me. If he is talking about 
spending affordable housing later, what I have said is it will be spent 
in accordance with a bill to be passed by the Congress. That is not 
trusting me.

And I have never said that one thing was going to accomplish the 
other. We have said we would set some money aside and later decide how 
to spend it. It doesn't do that here. It leaves the money with Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac. This isn't public money. It is a non sequitur. I 
repeat.

It says we have a deficit in Social Security. That is too bad. Let's 
keep fighting the war in Iraq for hundreds of billions of dollars, 
let's keep doing all these other things, but let's not take money from 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that would not otherwise contribute a penny 
to Social Security and spend it on affordable housing.
