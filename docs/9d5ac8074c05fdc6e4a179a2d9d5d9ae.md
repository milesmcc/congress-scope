Mr. NYE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Filner for his 
leadership on this issue and also Chairman Michaud. I am proud to rise 
in support of this legislation that will bring a commonsense solution 
to a long-standing problem.

For far too long, the VA health care system has been plagued with 
budgets that were too little, too late. Insufficient funding for 
veterans' health care leads to waiting lists, delayed care and veterans 
being turned away from VA hospitals and clinics. Underfunding threatens 
the very quality of care that the VA has worked so hard to achieve.

But just as important as how much funding the VA receives is when the 
VA receives that funding. With just three exceptions, the budget has 
been late for 20 of the past 23 years, this year included. When funding 
is late, the budget levels are uncertain, and it makes it harder to 
plan ahead for the needs of our veterans.

H.R. 1016 will solve this problem by authorizing VA's medical care 
budget in advance. Moreover, to help ensure that we have sufficient 
funding, H.R. 1016 adds transparency to the budget process by requiring 
the Government Accountability Office to audit the VA's internal budget. 
This way, we can see if the budget request accurately reflects the 
projected needs of our veterans.

Mr. Speaker, the commitment of our men and women in uniform does not 
stop at the end of the fiscal year nor do the needs of our veterans. 
Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stand ready to defend our 
Nation whenever they are called upon. We can plan for the future 
security of the United States because we know that our troops will be 
there. We owe them that same commitment in return.

The passage of this legislation is critical to ensure that our 
veterans receive their benefits on time, and it will allow the VA to 
plan ahead to meet the needs of the new veterans returning home each 
day from Iraq and Afghanistan. No longer can we allow the care of our 
Nation's veterans to be affected by the unstable budgetary process.

I am proud to support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to do 
the same.
