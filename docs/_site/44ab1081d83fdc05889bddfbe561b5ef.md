# TAX EXTENDERS ACT OF 2009

`Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts â€” 9 December 2009`

Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
might consume.

Mr. Speaker, I guess Mr. Camp, who is my friend, wasn't referring to 
me when he talked about the Democrats who didn't like tax relief. They 
forgot about the idea that I was the lead sponsor on the net operating 
loss bill, and have supported accelerated depreciation allowance, and 
believe that there are some tax cuts, in fact, that are better than 
others. And, at the same time, I think we could all find unity in the 
suggestion today that one thing we've discovered is that tax cuts 
really don't pay for themselves.

But I rise in support of this extenders legislation that we're 
considering today, and certainly Mr. Rangel should be acknowledged for 
the hard work that he has offered on this legislation. There ought to 
be an opportunity here for us, Mr. Speaker, to find some common ground. 
There are many, many, many good parts of this legislation that I know 
our friends on the other side support.

There are provisions here in the bottom of the ninth inning, with two 
out, that are expiring; and we need to give some predictability to 
decisions that will be made by businesses and individuals over the 
course of the next year. And this is going to be the last chance that 
we're going to have to do it this year.

This bill contains extensions of many popular incentives. For my home 
State of Massachusetts, this bill means that 94,000 teachers will get a 
deduction for their out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies, no 
small matter.



It means that more than 1,000 businesses in Massachusetts will get 
some credits for the millions they spend on research here in the United 
States. A reminder, the research and development tax credit is in this 
bill, and it is critical to retaining American jobs. Without this bill, 
125,000 families in Massachusetts cannot take the deduction for college 
tuition expenses. This legislation provides significant tax relief to 
millions of families nationwide both in red States, purple States, and 
blue States.

There are 12 million families nationwide who live in States with no 
income tax; however, this bill does provide a State sales tax 
deduction.

This bill also includes a number of popular tax incentives for 
alternative fuels. There are also packages of tax benefits to assist 
distressed communities and those hit by natural disasters. There are 
many well-crafted provisions in this bill. There's not really enough 
time to address all of them.

This bill does no harm to the Federal budget. The cost of these cuts 
is completely offset by two revenue raisers, one of which I have 
offered and authored, and I know there is broad support across America 
for that issue. This is the Foreign Bank Account Reporting bill, which 
will shut down abuses by wealthy taxpayers hiding money in overseas 
banks.

And for the life of me, I can't understand why everybody in this 
institution is not supportive of this measure. Transparency is 
important. 160,000 soldiers in Iraq, about to be 160,000 soldiers in 
Afghanistan, and we have taken our sweet time by not cracking down on 
these tax evaders who don't want to pay their fair share at the same 
time that we had these extensive commitments around the world. I'd like 
to poll that question in any congressional district in America. We have 
taken the comments of those who are impacted and we have made this 
reporting regime a workable enforcement tool in this legislation. 
Again, you should not be hiding money in foreign bank accounts for the 
sole purpose of avoiding American taxes.

The second offset is a carry interest proposal which seeks to ensure 
investment managers pay taxes on their earnings as income tax rates 
rather than capital gains.

Let me also suggest that Mr. Rangel has crafted a balanced bill. 
Again, I will repeat, it does no harm to the Federal Treasury. He has 
included a directive to the nonpartisan and, I think, highly effective 
and professional Joint Committee on Taxation to review the 
effectiveness of all of these extenders so that we could begin in 
earnest our effort to reform the Tax Code.

I certainly am supportive of this measure. I hope it will find broad 
support across this institution.

With that, I reserve the balance of my time.
