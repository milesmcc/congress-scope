Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Jirair S. 
Hovnanian, a successful family and businessman who started a 
construction company in New Jersey over 40 years ago.

Mr. Hovnanian is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's 
Wharton School in 1952, after emigrating from Kirkuk, Iraq. His 
company, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, built more than 6,000 homes, mainly in 
Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties. To his family he was known 
as a generous nurturer, who pursued the American dream. Mr. Hovnanian 
started his company in 1964 after splitting with a company he started 
with his three brothers. In recognition of his success, the National 
Ethnic Coalition of Organizations presented Mr. Hovnanian with the 
Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2006 for his numerous contributions to 
the country.

Mr. Hovnanian's life of service is worthy of admiration, and in 
addition to being a constituent and colleague, I am proud to call Mr. 
Hovnanian a friend. Madam Speaker, I commend Mr. Hovnanian today for 
all that he has done for the First Congressional District of New Jersey 
and our country.
