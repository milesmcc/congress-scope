# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `285be45928788c33377e829d4dc0d89d`

Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to note that this debate is about so 
many things other than the resolution that is before us. Simple, 
straightforward, in plain English language, two points. The first is, 
we in this Congress fully support those wonderful young men and women 
in uniform.

Secondly, we do not agree with the addition of 21,500 troops into 
Iraq. That is what we ought to be debating.

I listened to my good friend from Virginia speak of Normandy, I was 
there with him. I saw my friend, Dr. Tommy MacDonnell, with a worn 
Purple Heart and a Cluster and his Silver Star in his uniform that day. 
Great memories, great American victory. But what in the world is the 
debate involving other battles, other days, other conditions, when we 
ought to be talking about this? This is a simple, straightforward 
debate.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague, the 
gentleman from Georgia, a member of the Armed Services Committee (Mr. 
Marshall).
