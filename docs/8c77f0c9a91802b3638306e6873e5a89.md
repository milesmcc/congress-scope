Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. I would just note that, as the 
gentleman has mentioned, it is important that we honor the 5 years of 
service and sacrifice of our troops and their families in the war in 
Iraq and remember our troops serving in Afghanistan and throughout the 
world.

I would note that Ranking Member Ehlers is a cosponsor of this 
resolution, and both conflicts are still ongoing. Our troops' efforts 
have gone above and beyond the call of duty. Their sacrifice and 
dedication to their country must be honored, as well as the sacrifice 
and dedication of American troops stationed at home and around the 
world. And I am pleased that we will have this important recognition in 
the people's House, in the rotunda.

I thank the gentleman for yielding.
