Ms. MIKULSKI. The quote is as follows:




 $8 million has been awarded to 17 projects by the NSF under 


 a joint NSF/Department of Defense solicitation. The 


 competition, Social and Behavioral Dimensions of National 


 Security, Conflict and Cooperation, is focused on basic 


 social and behavioral science of strategic importance to US 


 national security policy.


So again, the competition is in the social science directorate. And 
the four topic areas the DOD thought it was important to contract out, 
through the


NSF, are in the following areas, according to this article:




 Authoritarian regimes, the strategic impact of religious 


 and cultural change, terrorist organizations and idealogies, 


 and new dimensions in national security.


They awarded these 17 grants, and let me read what some of them are. 
One is experimental analysis of alternative models of conflict 
bargaining. Now, you might say: Ho-hum. But you know what, maybe some 
idea out of that will help us crack how we can bring peace to the 
Middle East. Another is mapping terrorist organizations. Well, that is 
a pretty good idea. Maybe some of that research will help us get out of 
Afghanistan. How about predicting the nature of conflict? Well, we kind 
of know what that is, but do we really? Because if we understand the 
nature of conflict, maybe we can learn to defang conflict.

Let's look at another issue which I am very concerned about because 
of my worry about the planet--avoiding water wars: environmental 
security. These may be new threats to the United States.

I could read every one of these, but what I want to say is that DOD 
has partnered with NSF--to quote from this article--''to reach the 
broadest range of academic, social and behavioral science, and this 
collaboration combines the insights of DOD with the peer review 
expertise of NSF in support of the agencies' desire to promote basic 
social and behavioral research in areas that will benefit the United 
States.''

''Federal Technology Watch'' said it best. To take out $9 million is 
really penny-wise and pound-foolish. I am going to oppose the amendment 
of the Senator on that issue. I will oppose the amendment of the 
Senator on taking money from much-needed Commerce Department 
renovations and putting it in IG because we do fund the President's 
request in IG.

I do, however, like the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma on 
more transparency in government reports that are coming into the 
Commerce Department. I believe we could have passed that one by voice 
vote. I am sorry we have to go through the mechanics of a recorded 
vote. He is worried I would drop it in conference, but I could give him 
my word that we would maintain that amendment as best we could. But so 
be it, the Senator is entitled to that.

So, Mr. President, as we conclude our conversation this afternoon, I 
want to be very clear. We oppose two of the Coburn amendments. I accept 
one that you will see down at the desk where I stand.

I had hoped we could avoid a cloture vote. Senator Shelby and I have 
worked hard on a bipartisan bill, and I once again acknowledge the 
Senator from Alabama, my Republican colleague. We have an excellent 
bill that funds not only the Commerce Department but the Justice 
Department, and now we are facing the threat of a filibuster by 
amendment after amendment. I had hoped we could have reached some kind 
of agreement on a limited number of amendments, but since we can't, it 
looks as if we are going to have to go to cloture.

I think we have had a good discussion, and I want to reiterate the 
three goals of the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee. No. 1, we 
want to promote the security of the American people. We want to do it 
over there and we want to do it here. That is why we fund the Justice 
Department. We also want to promote innovation, and we have vigorous 
funding for our science agencies and innovation from the government 
that will also be on the side of those innovators. No. 3, where we do 
agree with the Senator from Oklahoma is on increased oversight, 
accountability, stewardship, and transparency.

Mr. President, I know we are about 5 minutes from the vote, so I will 
now reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
