Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, efforts to cut off funding for our 
troops in harm's way is simply unacceptable. It would be a devastating 
message to the brave men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, their 
families and the families of our Nation's fallen heroes. No one knows 
this better than Sam Johnson, a true American hero, and I commend him 
on introducing H.R. 511.

It is time for the Democrats to say what they mean and mean what they 
say. They can't have it both ways. To vote to support troops in the 
field and then vote not to give them the resources needed to win can be 
deceptive, dangerous, and could put the lives of American servicemen 
and -women at even greater risk.

If the Democrat majority does not support the President's plan, they 
are in the majority, they need to put forth their plan that is in the 
interest of the American people, and they must also reflect upon the 
cost of failure. They must understand how high the stakes are in Iraq, 
both in terms of human life and global stability. Our failure in Iraq 
could cause the nation to become what Afghanistan once was, a breeding 
ground for terrorists. Let's work together and find freedom and 
security in Iraq.
