---


Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of 
Army Private First Class Johnathon Miles Millican, dedicating the 
United States Post Office located in Lula, Georgia, as the ''Private 
Johnathon Millican Lula Post Office.''

Twenty-year-old Private First Class Johnathon Millican, a Hall 
County, Georgia, native, was killed by insurgents in Iraq while 
conducting a dismounted operation in Karbala on January 20, 2007. 
Private First Class Millican was off duty in a communications room 
talking with his wife when the attackers fired several rounds into the 
room with an AK-47 and one of them tossed in a concussion grenade. 
Courageously, he covered the grenade with his body, attempting to 
protect his comrades from the enemy intrusion. Private First Class 
Johnathon Millican was later awarded the Silver Star Medal of Honor for 
his courage, valor, and dedication for his fellow soldiers.

Johnathon Millican had attended Lula Elementary, East Hall Middle 
School, and East Hall High school in my home County of Hall. While in 
high school, Johnathon was active in the community, working the 
concessions stand at the community ballpark and coaching a 5-year-old 
T-Ball team. After graduating from high school in 2005, he moved to 
Locust Grove, Alabama, before enlisting in the Army. Johnathon was a 
member of the 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment from Fort 
Richardson, Alaska. Johnathon Millican left behind his wife, Shannon; 
his parents, Mitchell and Angie Millican; and Mary and Ronald Lykins 
and sisters, Amber'le, Ashley, and Amanda.

Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to rise today to pay tribute to this 
courageous young man and to join my constituents


of Lula, Georgia, in naming the ''Private Johnathon Millican Post 
Office.'' This honor will serve as a lasting reminder of the true 
recognition that is deserving of a fallen hometown hero who sacrificed 
his life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers.

Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a copy of the letter from Mr. 
Milton Turner, the Mayor of the City of Lula, requesting that this post 
office be named the ''Private Johnathon Millican Lula Post Office.''

























 City of Lula,





















Lula, GA, August 20, 2007.


 Subject: Consideration of Honorarium for PFC Johnathon 




 Millican.



 Congressman Nathan Deal,


 Wachovia Center, Jesse Jewell Parkway, Gainesville, GA.



 Dear Congressman Deal: This letter represents the request 


 of the City of Lula to recognize and honor the sacrifice and 


 contributions made by a local young man, a fallen hero, 


 Private First Class Johnathon Millican with the recognition 


 and honor of his service and dedication to his country the 


 naming of the Lula Post Office located on McLoud Street. Our 


 20-year-old young hero (a Hall County Native), was killed by 


 insurgents in Iraq on Jan. 20, he had covered an enemy 


 concussion grenade with his body attempting to protect his 


 comrades from the enemy intrusion and was one of five U.S. 


 soldiers killed during the attack in Karbala.



 Johnathon had attended Lula Elementary and East Hall Middle 


 School and High School only recently moving to Locust Grove 


 Alabama before enlisting in the Army. Millican was a member 


 of the 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment from Fort 


 Richardson, Alaska.



 PFC Millican was off duty in a communications room 


 exchanging e-mails with his wife when the Jan. 20 attack 


 started. The attackers fired several rounds into the room 


 with an AK47 and one of them tossed in a grenade. In an 


 earlier interview, Mitchell Millican told The Birmingham News 


 his son was on one knee facing the door ''ready to shoot'' at 


 that point and ''He could just as easily have jumped behind a 


 desk or ducked down or whatever, but he chose to cover the 


 grenade'' Mitchell Millican said ''and, to me, that shows 


 character''.



 We know of your commitment to our service men and woman and 


 know how moved you were at his loss; this honor would help to 


 establish the true recognition deserving of a fallen hero. 


 Also we would encourage your efforts to move forward the 


 campaign to have the pentagon award PFC J. Millican with the 


 ''Medal of Honor'' a process which we realize could take 


 months or even years.



 Further we hope to have the opportunity in the near future 


 to honor Jonathon's heroics here in Hall County and depending 


 on your guidance will await some possible timetable for 


 suggested dedication. Please advise the city of your schedule 


 allowing your attendance and participation.





 Best regards,























Mayor Milton Turner.
