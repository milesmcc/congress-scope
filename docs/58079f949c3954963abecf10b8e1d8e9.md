Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment. And 
I want to be clear to my colleague from Iowa we all agree that the 
United States should not be an occupying power in Iraq, but in no way 
does my acceptance of this amendment come to my or the American 
people's acquiescence to establishing any other kind of short- or long-
term basing agreements in Iraq. But we are accepting the amendment.
