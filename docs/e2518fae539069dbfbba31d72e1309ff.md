`Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia â€” 8 September 2009`

Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond to some of 
what I've just heard on the floor of the House of Representatives. I 
think it's important to know--and certainly my constituents do--that 
the crushing debt left behind from the last 8 years of ruinous 
Republican control was a debt inherited by this Congress and this 
administration because of Republican policies, of the refusal to pay 
for the programs they undertook, of the willingness to allow PAYGO 
legislation to expire, to provide a medical care provision in the 
Medicare D prescription drug benefit that was not paid for, and to have 
two ruinous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that were off budget. I think 
it's important that our constituents understand who was responsible for 
the debt we now have to manage and the debt we have to get away from.
