`Ms. NORTON â€” 12 March 2009`

Ms. NORTON. I thank the gentleman not only for yielding to me, I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership. When people see me come to the 
floor, they are used to my coming to the floor for a bill on the 
District, often a bill I've sponsored.

This is what is known as a Special Order or Special Hour, but it 
wasn't a Special Hour that I requested. I cannot say enough about how 
much it meant to me to hear colleagues who could be on a plane now give 
up that time to come to the floor to speak on this matter.

The chairman of the Progressive Caucus could be halfway--is from 
halfway across the country in Minnesota; not to mention the Chair of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, who has even further to go.

Indeed, it ought to be said that today the Congress let out early. So 
many hightailed it, of course, to their own districts, who would have 
otherwise been here.

The gentlelady from California has my thanks for another initiative 
she took, and that is the meeting that was held yesterday with the 
Speaker of the House.

The Congressional Black Caucus--of course, this is a largely African 
American city, but it's also a city where the Black Caucus would be out 
in front for the vote if anybody was denied the vote. But the Black 
Caucus has carried this since it was founded. The Speaker, in fact, 
agreed to a meeting with us in her office. It was a very important and 
very gratifying meeting, all at the leadership of the Congresswoman 
from California.


I cannot thank her enough. It's very important to me what Mr. Ellison 
and Ms. Lee have done because it is their own initiative. It's very 
important to say that, unlike with so many issues, they are broadly 
representative of our House and of our Senate and of our country in 
believing that we should have the vote.

The poll that I think is duplicated perhaps in what Mr. Ellison had 
shows an unusual majority across all lines; most Democrats and 
Republicans. And think about it. What red-blooded American would oppose 
the right to be represented in the national legislature?

How many of us would want to be at the mercy of a group of people, 
however benevolent, where none of them was accountable to us, even by a 
single vote. That's been where the residents of the District of 
Columbia have been for 212 years now because the expectation of the 
Framers that Congress would in fact make sure that the vote continued 
after the 10-year transition period has not occurred. Congress dropped 
the ball.

Those who gave the land from Maryland and Virginia actually got in 
the first Congress legislation that assured them that the residents of 
Maryland and Virginia, who now, after 10 years, would be part of the 
Nation's Capitol, would be left with exactly what they had when they 
left Virginia and Maryland. They voted for Members of Congress. They 
voted in the same way all the other Americans did. It is a long, sad 
story as to why that did not happen.

Understand what my colleagues have been talking about--only the House 
vote. We are not talking about a vote in the Senate of the United 
States. Only in the people's House. We are seeking from the House 
exactly what the House gave us last time.

In an extraordinary vote, this House was the first to pass this bill 
and send it to the Senate. They fell three votes short because, 
remember, over there, 51 percent is not a majority. You need 60 
percent. That's a new definition of majority that the Senate has 
created.

I want to thank my colleagues first for the leadership of my 
colleagues who have come forward as representative, I can truly say, of 
this House. But I want to thank for all of those who voted for this 
bill last year.

This bill originated with one of my Republican colleagues who thought 
of the idea of making it as bipartisan as possible in the hopes that 
that would draw members of his party as well as my party because the 
District, like every large city virtually in America, has more 
Democrats than Republicans.

So he teamed us with Utah, which had barely missed getting a vote 
because Mormon missionaries, who were out of the State on a religious 
mission, always had been counted, and they were not counted in the 2000 
census.

Utah was only too happy to join. I want to thank the Governor of 
Utah, its own delegation, who have been with us from the beginning.

Two hundred-nineteen Democrats voted for this bill last time. Only 
six voted ''no.'' That is very extraordinary. And I am asking each and 
every one of them to repeat the vote they made last time.

I was in a meeting with a Republican Member who shares my view on the 
Capitol Visitor Center because there's some things we want to fix about 
how


staff can conduct their own tours. He came to me afterwards and said, 
By the way, I'm voting for D.C. voting rights this time.

I do expect that there will be more Republicans voting for the bill 
than last time. Twenty-two Republicans voted for the bill. They were 
under some pressure not to. I want to thank Tom Davis, who spearheaded 
this bill. He has since retired but is helping me even as I speak.

I do want to say that the bill carries a triple bonus. How often is 
it that we use the word bipartisan and it doesn't quite mean that each 
side gets exactly what the other side gets?

Look at what happens here. Utah felt cheated, and that is a good word 
that Mr. Cummings used for how residents who pay taxes and go to war 
here feel, and they have joined with the District of Columbia, which 
has never had a vote. If that isn't bipartisan. One for you, one for 
me. No compromises there. One each. If that is not bipartisan, I 
haven't heard a real definition of the word.

This vote does something for the House. It increases the House for 
the first time in 100 years. Every time that a new State has come in, 
you have the same 435 seats. You're going to have 437 seats now.



In addition to Republicans and Democrats each getting one, now they 
have one more seat that makes it easier for each to compete. You would 
think that Republicans would particularly welcome that since they are 
in the fastest growing areas of the United States. This failure of the 
House to permanently increase the House in 100 years has been broken if 
we pass this bill.

Before I ask another question of my good friend who has remained with 
us for a little while, I do want people to know what it is that moves 
most Americans by these kinds of margins, almost two-thirds of all 
adults, for example, being for the bill, almost 60 percent Republicans, 
almost 70 percent Democrats. What is it that moves them?

Americans would have given us this vote before, I am sure, if we 
could have gotten the word out. We have an indigenous organization 
called D.C. Vote. We have got a leadership conference on civil rights 
with its 200 organizations spreading the word for one-half dozen years 
now. That is the only way that this has become visible enough so that 
people who didn't even know we didn't have the vote, which is most 
Americans, now know it and cannot conceive of it.

Who can conceive of somebody in our country paying taxes without 
getting any payback on that right to vote ''yea'' or ''nay'' on whether 
those taxes should be paid or not? And I know Americans cannot conceive 
of the experience I have had of going to Arlington Cemetery to bury 
residents from the District of Columbia in the Iraq and Afghanistan 
war, who have now succeeded in getting the vote for the people of those 
countries who did not have it before, and died without having that vote 
in their own Nation's capital, the only capital of any nation to deny 
the vote to its own residents. This is an anomaly. Don't blame it on 
the framers, and don't blame it on the American people. Now that they 
know it, they say do it; don't leave us in this way with this message 
that steps on our message of democracy around the world, a district the 
average size of congressional districts in the United States and a 
district that is larger than some States.

This point has been made, but let me drive it home when they say the 
notion of having everybody who can vote, except you. What Members are 
referring to is that among the things that the District has to do is to 
send its budget here before it can spend a dollar of its own tax-raised 
money; send its laws here, and let them lie over and see if someone 
wants to overturn them.

So, this House will see the D.C. appropriation come forward this 
year. That is another way of saying the taxes that the people who live 
in the District of Columbia alone have raised, they will see that come 
forward as an appropriation.

Now, my good friend from California is now a member of the 
Appropriations Committee. I wish you would describe what it means to 
come forward with this bill, knowing good and well that you are going 
to have a vote on it, every Member on both sides of the aisle are going 
to have a vote on it, but that no Member from the District of Columbia 
will have a vote for it. You are on that committee.
