`Mrs. FEINSTEIN â€” 17 February 2007`

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yesterday, the House of Representatives clearly 
expressed its support for our troops and its disapproval of the 
President's action to escalate the war. Today, it is the Senate's turn.

Today, I believe that by voting for cloture, a majority of the Senate 
will convey the same message. There may not be 60 votes, but I believe 
there will be a majority. Our forces have been in Iraq for 4 years, 
$380 billion has been spent, more than 3,000 troops have been killed, 
and nearly 24,000 have been wounded. My home State of California has 
lost more than 300 brave men and women, with thousands injured.

Iraq is in chaos: Sunni fighting Shia, Shia fighting Sunni, car 
bombs, IEDs, assassinations, mortar attacks, downed helicopters, death 
squads, and sabotaged infrastructure. Every day, we learn of new 
attacks, new casualties, new bloodshed, and no end in sight.

I believe this surge is a mistake. Four years ago, U.S. Armed Forces 
went to Iraq to be liberators. Today, they are caught in the bloody 
crossfire of internecine fighting. The question is, Can the American 
military solve a civil war? I don't believe it can. It was certainly 
not the mission Congress authorized in 2002. So the time has come for 
the Senate to say so, just as the House has done. The time has come to 
declare that our time has come and gone in Iraq. The time has come to 
speak clearly, and the time has come to change course.

The authorization for use of military force, approved by the Congress 
in October 2002, carries with it congressional approval of this war. 
The way to change course is to change that authorization. Therefore, 
today, I introduce legislation that will put the expiration date of 
December 31, 2007, on the authorization for use of military force.

The President would be required to return to Congress if he seeks to 
renew the resolution. The resolution recognizes that conditions have 
changed since the 2002 authorization was approved. Saddam Hussein is 
gone. An Iraqi Government has been established. It also recognizes the 
flaws of the 2002 authorization. Iraq, in fact, had no weapons of mass 
destruction. It was not closely allied with al-Qaida.

This resolution does not call for a precipitous withdrawal--let me 
stress that--but it sets a time limit--the remaining 10 months of the 
year--to stage an orderly redeployment and to transition this mission. 
That mission would be limited to training, equipping, and advising 
Iraqi security and police forces; to force protection and security for 
U.S. Armed Forces and civilian personnel; support of Iraqi security 
forces for border security and protection, to be carried out with the 
minimum forces required for that purpose; targeted counterterrorism 
operations against al-Qaida and foreign fighters within Iraq; and 
logistical support in connection with these activities.

I believe this legislation is the next logical step following today. 
It is simple, it is concise. After the majority vote today sends our 
disapproval to the President, it is time to consider the next step. I 
submit this resolution as a possible next step.

I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be 
printed in the Record.
