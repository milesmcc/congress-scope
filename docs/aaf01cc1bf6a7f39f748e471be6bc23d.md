Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I rise in support of this legislation, 
and I yield myself such time as I may consume.

The House easily passed this bill under suspension at the end of 
March and, as often happens with the legislative process, when it went 
to the Senate, a few changes were made. Therefore, we are here again 
today simply to give final approval to a bill we have already 
supported, and rightfully so.

The primary purpose of this legislation is to make technical changes 
to ensure smooth implementation of the bipartisan higher education 
reforms enacted last year. Second, it addresses a pressing issue facing 
the Federal student loan programs. And third, the legislation includes 
a provision to assist students who have lost a parent to the wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

The technical corrections are just that, clarifications needed to 
ensure that the first comprehensive renewal of higher education 
programs in a decade can be put into place as Congress intended. The 
legislation will also help student loan borrowers who have fallen 
behind to rebuild their damaged credit by making these loans eligible 
for emergency liquidity measures enacted last fall. It's a simple 
change that will make a real difference for borrowers who are just 
trying to do the right thing by restarting regular payments on their 
Federal student loans.

The other change we are making in this bill is also important for a 
different set of students, students who have suffered a terrible loss 
but who have continued to move forward to achieve a postsecondary 
education. And I'm talking about the students who have lost a parent 
due to the military action taking place in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The Higher Education Act reauthorization bill that was passed by this 
body last Congress included a provision that would allow Pell-eligible 
students to automatically receive the maximum Pell Grant if one of 
their parents died as a result of their military service in Iraq or 
Afghanistan. The legislation before us today extends a similar benefit 
to students who may fall outside of the income limits placed on the 
Pell Grant program but who have also suffered the same type of loss.

Under this legislation, all students who have lost a soldier-parent 
as a direct result of fighting in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan will 
be eligible for a grant. The parents of these students have given their 
lives in service to our country.

A college student who loses a parent in the war loses so much more 
than we can fathom. These students will not have their parent around to 
move into their first dorm room or hear complaints about cafeteria 
food. They will not have their parent's consolation and encouragement 
to continue even after a poor test grade or a difficult professor. Of 
course, these students who lose a parent in Iraq or Afghanistan will 
not have the financial support of their parent in this time of rising 
college costs and economic uncertainty.

While this legislation does not provide students with the same type 
of support a parent could provide, I hope it will ease the financial 
burden of paying for college just a little bit.

The legislation before us easily passed the House once. I hope for a 
similar result again, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting 
''yes'' on this legislation.

I yield back the balance of my time.
