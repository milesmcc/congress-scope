Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I think it's been very, very clear here this 
is a closed rule. It's outrageous that we have continued down this 
pattern of closed rules; and we were promised, the American people were 
promised much better than that. The underlying legislation is 
legislation that the administration just announced the President would 
veto if it were to pass. We should be debating the work of the Iraq 
Study Group, the bipartisan package; and, unfortunately, with this 
closed rule, we're denied a chance to do that.

I also believe that my colleague from New Mexico, while debate seemed 
to be very personal among members of the Intelligence Committee, it 
comes down to the very strong statements that have been made by the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence 
and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. We need to 
immediately modernize the three-decade-old Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act.

So I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on the previous question so 
that we'll have an opportunity to make in order the very thoughtful 
legislation that has been introduced by our colleague from Albuquerque, 
Mrs. Wilson.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
