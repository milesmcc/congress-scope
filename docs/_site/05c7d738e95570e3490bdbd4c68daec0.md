Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week, I asked unanimous consent with 
respect to S.J. Res. 9, along with several other resolutions regarding 
the subject of Iraq--that we proceed on these--and there was an 
objection. So I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 72, S.J. Res. 9, 
and send a cloture motion to the desk.
