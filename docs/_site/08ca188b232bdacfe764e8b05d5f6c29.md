Mr. LIEBERMAN. Excellent. Essentially, these are corrections to 
clarify what the intention of myself and the sponsors, such as Senator 
McCain, were in submitting this. There were some helpful suggestions 
made, for instance, from the Intelligence Committee that wanted the 
reports done by the commander of the Multi-National Force and our 
Ambassador to Iraq to be done in cooperation with the Director of 
National Intelligence.

We have added a specific recitation of the fact that on May 28 of 
this year, Ambassador Crocker met in Baghdad with representatives of 
the Government of Iran to express concern about Iranian anticoalition 
activity in Iraq.

We call on the Director of National Intelligence to issue the 
National Intelligence Estimate on Iran that has been promised for some 
time now without further delay.

We indicate that we support diplomacy with the representatives of the 
Government of Iran in order to stop any actions by the Iranian 
Government or its agents against U.S. servicemembers in Iraq.

Again, we hope they will respond to these diplomatic initiatives.

And then, finally, the section I referred to in my colloquy with 
Senator Durbin, that this is not intended to authorize or otherwise 
speak to the use of Armed Forces against Iran.
