Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee for his devotion to this issue during his entire 
career in the Congress. I don't think that this is a complicated 
question that is here before us today. I think that it is very clear. 
It is very clear in terms of the values of the American people. Why 
wouldn't a Congress, any Congress, offer health insurance for its most 
vulnerable citizens, the little ones, of our country?

That is what is on the floor today. That is what is on the floor. 
They are smart, and they are grinning. Grinning. But do you know what? 
There are going to be the votes for this bill, and the bill is going to 
pass. And imagine the person that stands at the doctor's door and not 
allow children to go through: the President of the United States.

This is a bipartisan effort. The people of our country want us to 
come together for the families of this country, for the betterment of 
our country, to make an investment. Yes, through taxing tobacco. I 
would rather tax tobacco and protect the children of our country than 
to blow $10 billion a month in Iraq. I am proud of the Democrats. I am 
proud of the Republicans that support it. We should pass this and say a 
prayer that the President will come out of his cloud and sign the bill.
