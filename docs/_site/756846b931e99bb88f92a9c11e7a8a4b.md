`Mr. LEE of New York â€” 17 November 2010`

---


Mr. LEE of New York. I rise today to honor a great man, Army 
Specialist Blake D. Whipple of Williamsville, New York. Just 21 years 
old, Blake's life was taken by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan on 
November 5. It was his job to clear the roads of these devices, and he 
did so proudly.

Blake was a 2007 graduate of Williamsville East High School, and 
signed up to serve his country in 2009.

Blake's parents, Dave and Kim, expressed concern about him joining 
the Army, as any parent would, but Blake's parents sensed his passion 
and drive for wanting to be a part of something bigger. Blake was eager 
to serve his country and was proud of the work he was doing, and I know 
his family was extremely proud of him.

Blake was fortunate to be home in western New York for 2 weeks this 
past September. He was able to see his family and friends one last time 
before his life was cut so drastically short.

Blake proudly served our Nation with courage and bravery, and his 
life was taken far too soon. He will be missed.
