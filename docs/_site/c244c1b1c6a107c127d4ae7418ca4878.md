Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, a group of Senators, now for several 
years, has been working to reduce the estate tax. With the constraints 
on the budget, particularly with spending $348 million a day in Iraq, 
this has been difficult. But some of us have been working in good faith 
to reduce the 55-percent rate and to raise the unified credit. The tax 
in its current form is onerous, in my view unnecessary, and it clouds 
the ability of many of our successful business owners from planning the 
growth and expansion of their businesses that create jobs right here at 
home in America. Something should be done now, something that is real 
and does not increase our debt.

The amendment I offer will reduce the rate to 35 percent and increase 
the unified credit to $10 million. Most importantly, this is paid for 
by the President's own offsets in the budget he submitted to us. So it 
is fully paid for. It reduces the tax rate to 35 percent and increases 
the unified tax credit to $10 million.
