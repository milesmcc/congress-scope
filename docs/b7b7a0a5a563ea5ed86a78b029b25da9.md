Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my dear friend for yielding.

Madam Speaker, why would someone not vote for health insurance for 10 
million American children? There is the excuse that the bill covers 
illegal aliens.

Read section 605 of the bill; it doesn't. There is the excuse that it 
covers adults, not children. Read section 112 of the bill, which is 
called termination of coverage of nonpregnant childless adults. There 
is the excuse that it covers a lot of wealthy kids, but there is the 
fact that 91.3 percent of the children covered come from families that 
make less than $40,000 a year, and the rest live in States that are 
very, very expensive to live in, like mine in New Jersey.

Then there is the excuse that, well, it's bad for the budget somehow, 
unlike the $109 billion they want to send to Iraq. But the 
Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office says that over 10 years this bill saves $200 million for the 
Federal Treasury.

Ladies and gentlemen, no more excuses, vote ''yes''.
