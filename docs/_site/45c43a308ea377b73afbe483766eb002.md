Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, after years of funding cuts by Republican 
Congresses and the Bush administration to key education, veterans, 
college aid and transportation programs, this House is now bringing 
appropriations bills to the floor that invest in the right priorities, 
while also remaining fiscally responsible.

This week, Democratic leadership will pass the largest increase in 
veterans health care funding in history, a critical step in fulfilling 
our Nation's obligation to our service men and women, their families 
and our veterans.

The Veterans Health Administration estimates that they will treat 
54,000 more troops in 2008 than they did over the last year, including 
more than 263,000 veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. This 
House is going to provide our veterans the health care services they 
are entitled to.

We also add 1,000 new claims processors to reduce the backlog of 
benefit claims so that our veterans will get the services they need in 
a timely way.

Mr. Speaker, this Congress is dedicated to fulfilling our commitment 
to our veterans in a fiscally responsible way.
