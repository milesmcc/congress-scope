`Mr. POE of Texas â€” 14 September 2010`

---


Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

This resolution marks the ninth anniversary of the unprovoked attack 
on our Nation by individuals without conscience and on behalf of 
masters without mercy.

Those who witnessed the events of September 11 will always remember 
the inconceivable images and seemingly impossible events that unfolded 
before our own eyes. But however painful our own memories may be, they 
cannot compare with the suffering of the innocents who bore the horror 
directly, nor with those of their families and friends whose lives were 
torn apart without any warning.

Our purpose here is to honor and remember the victims and the many 
heroes of that endless day, September 11, 2001. We honor the thousands 
of innocent men, women and children who were targeted and murdered 
simply because they were Americans or because they embraced the concept 
of freedom and democracy. We honor those who, instead of being 
immobilized by fear, immediately began to search for and rescue 
survivors at great risk to themselves, many of whom lost their lives in 
their efforts to save many others.

We honor those in our military who have fought our enemies in distant 
lands and have borne heavy burdens to prevent them from striking us yet 
again. And even as I speak, men and women of our Armed Forces are 
fighting for us and for our country far from their homes in far-off 
lands. And it has affected many people, even here in Washington, D.C. 
and in the Congress and our staff. My own chief of staff has two sons 
that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan in the Marine Corps, and there 
are many others as we speak today.

On September 11, we were forced to realize that what we had 
experienced was not really an isolated blow but instead only the latest 
assault in a war that radical Islamist militants had been waging 
against the United States for years.

We had already suffered many casualties over the preceding decades, 
but had not understood that these were in fact from a series of battles 
in an escalating war against the United States and a war against 
freedom. These include the taking of our embassy in Iran and the 
holding of American hostages for 444 days; the destruction of our 
embassy and marine barracks in Lebanon in the 1980s; the first World 
Trade Center bombing in 1993; the attacks on the Khobar Towers in Saudi 
Arabia in 1996; and the attacks on the U.S.S. Cole and our embassies in 
Kenya and Tanzania also in the 1990s.

And at this very moment, our enemies are preparing to strike us again 
and with the same intent of slaughtering as many innocent people as 
they possibly can.

We cannot protect ourselves by hoping that somehow we will be spared 
new attacks, for these are certain to come unless we take action to 
prevent them. And we have done so.

Over the past 9 years, we have come to know our enemies, their plans, 
and their methods.



We are daily engaged and seeking them out, finding them in their 
hiding places and in their holes, uncovering their networks and 
eliminating their ability to harm us again. But our enemies have many 
allies and have sunk deep roots, roots that will not be easily 
destroyed. Victory will not be achieved in one decisive battle but 
through a sustained commitment that will stretch over many years. It 
will be fought in many different ways using the range of U.S. resources 
and capabilities and fought in many other places.

Some may shrink from that prospect; but, if we are to prevail over 
this enemy that is relentless in its hatred for us, our commitment to 
our Nation and the principles that we stand for, we must not only match 
but exceed their determination, the determination of our adversaries.

This is not really a war of choice but one that has been forced upon 
us by men whose dark vision of the world cannot be realized without 
first destroying America and our freedoms. Repeatedly throughout its 
history our country has been challenged by forces that at times seemed 
impossible to overcome. But however dark the unknowns we faced and 
however great our fears, we never shrank from our duty as a Nation, and 
we have always prevailed with the good Lord's help.

And on this day, let us remember those that we have lost, the many 
heroes with which we have been blessed, and those with whom our safety 
depends, and let us remember that they gave their lives for our 
country. And we should do our duty as all generations that have 
preceded us have done. And God bless this country now and always.

I reserve the balance of my time.
