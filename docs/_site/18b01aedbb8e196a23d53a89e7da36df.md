# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mr. KIND â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. KIND. I thank my friend for yielding me this time.

Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of the resolution before us. It is 
a very simple and straightforward resolution. It expresses our support 
and gratitude to our troops and our disapproval with the President's 
escalation plan in Iraq. I have believed for some time now that we are 
in desperate need of a new direction and not an escalation in Iraq.

It is not like we are confronted with a new plan by the President 
here today. We have tried three troop surges in the last 2 years alone, 
without the desired result. I don't know what the President sees or 
hears today that leads him to believe that the fourth time is a charm.

No, from the beginning, this has been the wrong war at the wrong time 
for the wrong reasons. We now know that Saddam Hussein did not, in 
fact, possess weapons of mass destruction. He had no involvement in the 
attacks on September 11. He had no links with al Qaeda. I believe then, 
as I do today, that while he may have been potentially dangerous, he 
was eminently containable.

But I too must share some responsibility for having supported the 
Iraq resolution in the fall of 2002. I did so while believing the 
President when he stated that the goal was disarmament and not regime 
change, that war would be a last resort and not a convenient option, 
that he would work through the U.N. Security Council and with the 
international community rather than taking unilateral action.

But I also believed that it was important at that time to get weapons 
inspection teams back in Iraq to search for weapons and to keep an eye 
on Saddam so he didn't develop capability to do harm. I also believe 
that we could not accomplish that goal without a threat of credible 
force hanging over Saddam's head.

When, in fact, we did accomplish it and got inspection teams back in 
with unfettered access, I was sitting through administration briefings 
asking them if we were cooperating with them and directing them to 
suspected sites. Of course we were, they said, but they are not finding 
anything.

That is when that pit in my stomach first formed, that perhaps Saddam 
did what he said he did all along, and that is disarm. That is when I, 
along with my friend and colleague, Sherrod Brown, drafted a letter 
signed by 150 of our colleagues in January of 2003 asking the President 
to give the inspection teams time to do their job and not rush in 
because they were not finding anything.

But instead of heeding our advice, he ordered the inspection teams 
out, sent our troops in with insufficient forces to secure the peace, 
with no plan for the day after, with no clear objectives and with no 
exit strategy, all contrary to the Powell Doctrine. Now we are where we 
are today with over $500 billion already spent, over 3,000 lives lost, 
over 23,000 injured who have returned home. And we are faced with no 
good options.

Yes, we do need a new direction and not an escalation. It is time for 
us to turn over responsibility for security to the Iraqi people so we 
can begin a redeployment of our forces, first within the country, let 
us get them off the front lines and off the main streets of Baghdad, 
where they can still play a support role, but which could also lead to 
a redeployment eventually out of country. We can then refocus our 
energies on the real national security threat, and that is dismantling 
the al Qaeda global network that we face, making sure we don't lose 
Afghanistan, making sure the Taliban doesn't reconstitute themselves 
and making sure that we bring those who are directly responsible for 
September 11 to justice, like Osama bin Laden, who is still at large 
and roaming free today. Ultimately, this conflict cannot be solved 
militarily, but only by tough political compromises between the Sunnis, 
Shia and Kurds. We cannot do this for them.

We also need to get the Arab League involved, because they can help 
with reconstruction, they can help with security, and they can help add 
legitimacy to the Iraqi government. It is not in their interest to see 
the Sunni-Shia conflict spread outside of the Iraq borders and sweep 
the region, which is a very real threat today. Nor is it in Iran and 
Syria's interests to be on the opposite sides of a civil war that may 
break out in Iraq. That is what a plan, a new direction should look 
like, one that we should be pursuing, rather than just more of the 
same, stay the course.

Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity on three occasions to visit 
our military command and our troops in the field in Iraq. I also 
visited our troops during the height of our military engagement in the 
Balkans. Nothing has made me prouder to be an American than seeing our 
troops in action, because they are so very good. They are well 
motivated, they are well trained. They are the best our Nation has to 
offer.

I have had 18 military funerals in my Congressional district alone, 
most of which I personally attended. If I don't have to attend another 
military funeral, if I don't have to pick up the phone to call another 
grieving family, I will be one of the happiest people in the world. 
They are a constant reminder of the human toll this is having, not only 
with our troops but with their families and our communities. There is 
not a day that goes by when I am not concerned about the safety and 
welfare of our troops.

That is exactly why we should be debating this resolution, because it 
is imperative that war is a last resort, that we as policymakers do 
everything we can to get the policy right because of the impact it has 
on our troops, their family, and our communities. It is important that 
we give them a mission with which they can succeed.

It is time to stop asking our troops to babysit a civil war. It is 
time to ask the Iraqis to stand up. It is time to support this 
resolution and give the President a clear indication of where this 
Congress stands.
