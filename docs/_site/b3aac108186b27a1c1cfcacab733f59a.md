Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as we approach 
Independence Day, I am grateful for the success of our troops in Iraq 
and in Afghanistan to protect American families by defeating terrorists 
overseas. With two sons who have served in Iraq and my former National 
Guard 218th Brigade in Afghanistan, I know firsthand our military's 
accomplishments.

The Department of Defense reports violence in Iraq has declined 
significantly. Security incidents have fallen to their lowest level in 
4 years. Civilian deaths are down 75 percent from a year ago, with the 
Iraqi military taking greater control over military operations against 
al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias.

Increased security has led to increased political and economic 
progress where Iraqis are sharing oil revenues, are developing and 
implementing a budget, and are taking greater financial responsibility 
for building their infrastructure. We should recognize these 
achievements to eliminate terrorist safe havens so our decisions here 
in Washington do not reverse this progress, which would threaten our 
allies and American families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
