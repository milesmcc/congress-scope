Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

I want to thank my friend Mr. Price for bringing this important 
legislation to the floor and would like to thank Chairman Conyers, 
Subcommittee Chairman Scott and the Judiciary Committee for their hard 
work on this very important issue.

My amendment would simply require the Department of Justice to issue 
descriptions of all charges that have been brought against contractors 
and contract employees in Iraq and Afghanistan and a description of the 
legal actions taken by the U.S. Government against them as a result of 
those charges.

H.R. 2740 requires the Department of Justice to issue a report that 
contains a list and descriptions of investigations that it is 
conducting into possible violations of U.S. law committed by contract 
personnel. This report must list the number of complaints it's 
received, the number of investigations it's begun, the number of 
criminal cases it has opened and the result of those cases.

My amendment would expand that requirement a bit further to ensure 
that the report includes a description of the charges that have been 
brought against contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan and a description 
of the legal action taken as a result of those charges.

Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
