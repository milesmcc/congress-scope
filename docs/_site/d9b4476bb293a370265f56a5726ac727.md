`Mr. FEINGOLD â€” 16 May 2007`

---


Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we speak, more than 150,000 brave 
American troops are in the middle of a violent civil war in Iraq, with 
more troops on the way. Meanwhile, the President has repeatedly made it 
clear that nothing--not the wishes of the American people, not the 
advice of military and foreign policy experts, not the concerns of 
members of both parties--will discourage him from pursuing a war that 
has no end in sight.

Congress cannot wait for the President to change course--we must 
change the course ourselves. Iraq's problems will not be solved by an 
open-ended, massive U.S. military engagement. And our own national 
security will be weakened until we bring this war to a close.

That is why I am pleased to join the majority leader and Senators 
Dodd, Whitehouse, Sanders, Leahy, Kerry, Kennedy, Boxer, Wyden and 
Harkin in introducing an amendment to bring this war to a close. Our 
amendment, which is the same as the Feingold-Reid bill, would require 
the President to begin safely redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq within 
120 days of enactment, and would require redeployment to be completed 
by March 31, 2008. At that point, with our troops safely out of Iraq, 
funding for the war would be ended, with three specific and limited 
exceptions: protecting U.S. infrastructure and personnel; training and 
equipping Iraqi security forces; and, perhaps most important, 
conducting ''targeted operations, limited in duration and scope, 
against members of al-Qaida and other international terrorist 
organizations.'' By enacting Feingold-Reid, we can finally focus 
on what should be our top national security priority--defeating al-
Qaida.


Some have suggested that cutting off funds for the war could mean 
cutting off funds for the troops. They would have people believe that, 
under my approach, our brave troops will be left to fend for themselves 
in Iraq, without training, equipment, or resources.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Using our power of the purse 
to end our involvement in the war would in no way endanger our brave 
servicemembers. By setting a date after which funding for the war will 
be terminated--as this amendment proposes--Congress can ensure that our 
troops are safely redeployed without harming our troops, as we did in 
Somalia in 1993.

While Feingold-Reid is not the only amendment we are considering, it 
is the only amendment that would bring this war to a close. I regret to 
say that the Levin-Reid amendment accomplishes very little, once the 
President gets through certifying and waiving whatever he needs to 
certify and waive to keep his policies in place.

Levin-Reid and the Warner amendment would ensure that Congress 
receives more reports on Iraqi progress in meeting benchmarks. We don't 
need reports to tell us that the President's policy isn't working. And 
we don't need reports to show us that our continued military presence 
in Iraq is a mistake, one that the America people overwhelmingly 
oppose. It is long past time for benchmarks, let alone benchmarks that 
aren't tied to meaningful consequences. Feingold-Reid will move us 
toward ending the war. Levin-Reid will move us backward.


As long as the President's Iraq policy goes unchecked, our courageous 
troops will continue to put their lives on the line unnecessarily, our 
constituents will continue to pour billions of their dollars into this 
war, our military readiness will continue to erode, and our ability to 
confront and defeat al-Qaida will be jeopardized. I urge my colleagues 
to support Feingold-Reid and oppose Levin-Reid.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
