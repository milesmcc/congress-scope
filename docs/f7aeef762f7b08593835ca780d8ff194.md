Mr. PENCE. I think war funding bills ought to be about war funding. 
Last week, the Democrat Congress tried and failed to pass an Iraq 
funding bill by piling billions of dollars in unrelated domestic 
spending and higher taxes on the backs of our soldiers. But because 
House Republicans took a stand, the American people could plainly see 
that the majority of the majority is willing to cut off funding to our 
soldiers, even when they are in harm's way.

With Memorial Day just around the corner, this Congress should stop 
playing politics with funding for our troops. We should pass a clean 
Iraq funding bill, legislation authored by Representative Jerry Lewis 
of California, and we should pass it this week. As we prepare to 
remember the heroes of conflicts past, let's make sure that today's 
heroes have the resources they need to get the job done and come home 
safe.
