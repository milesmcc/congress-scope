`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 26 March 2007`

---


Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, just as a transition to Ms. 
Wasserman Schultz, I would just say, elections matter; and there is 
probably no better example of that in recent history than the election 
in November. Things have just changed here. The air is different, the 
priorities are different, the rate of action is different.

And, Mr. Meek, I get why we had to have an election in order to 
change course in Iraq. I understand that this is a very difficult 
subject that has divided people for a number of years. Over the past 
several years, people, large numbers of people came to the conclusion 
that we needed to change course from the President's policy, that we 
needed to put a Congress here that is going to start standing up to 
this guy and insisting that there are some other fights that matter in 
this world, and that we need to invest back in Afghanistan, that we 
need to make sure that our borders here are protected and that we 
needed to start redeploying our forces.

So I get that we had to go to a national referendum in order to set a 
new course. That is an important issue that has divided people.

Now, people have come down pretty firmly in the past 12 or 18 months 
on the side of a new direction. That is why Friday, to me, was maybe 
the most gratifying day in the short number that I have been here. But, 
Mr. Meek, I don't get why we had to have an election to decide to 
support veterans.
