Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to address some of the comments 
made by the Republican leader.

First, the bill that is being considered was on the official public 
Web site of the House of Representatives a week ago. It has been 
available for at least that period of time. As a member of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, most of the contents of what we are 
considering were passed by the committee last year in October and 
November. To argue that this is a surprise is wrong. It has been 
available for scrutiny, for review, for a long period. That is why many 
of us believe we should move forward with it as quickly as possible.

Second, this argument that the stimulus, which was supposed to be 
additive, to put money into the economy that otherwise would not go 
into the economy, is a reason not to pass this bill is to ignore the 
obvious. This bill funds the Government. This bill makes certain that 
when it comes to the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, 
Energy, related issues, financial services, Interior, Labor, EPA, State 
Department, Transportation, Homeland Security, and so many others, we 
are going to provide for the basic appropriations and budgets for these 
agencies.

I understand--I hope all Senators understand--that these agencies 
need to do their work, whether or not the economy is strong. We need to 
be putting this money into these agencies to continue their ordinary 
business. That is essential.

I also am troubled every day to hear a chorus from the Republican 
side of the aisle about deficits. Let's remember the facts. When 
President Bill Clinton left office, he had managed to balance the 
budget each year for 3 years. He left to President George W. Bush a 
surplus. At that point, the debt of the United States, accumulated from 
the beginning of the Republic until that moment, was about $5 trillion. 
President George W. Bush was handed an economy that was strong, a 
budget surplus, and a national debt of $5 trillion. Eight years later, 
we all know the state of the economy. We certainly know that the 
national debt under George W. Bush doubled. It went from $5 to $10 
trillion in a matter of 8 years.

We know what happened. When it came to the budgets, the Republicans 
and President Bush decided they would use a little sleight of hand. Do 
you know how much money was included in the budgets of President Bush 
for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? The answer is zero. Every year 
they would take the cost of these wars off the budget and say: It is 
emergency spending so we are not going to budget for it. So not only 
did they double the national debt, not only did they drive us deeply 
into deficit each year, they did it in a way that most of us would 
agree was at least concealment, instead of being honest and open with 
the people.

Now comes President Obama, inherits an economic recession, the likes 
of which this country has not seen for 75 years. He says we have to 
move and move quickly with the stimulus package. In 3 weeks and 2 days 
after being sworn in as President, he passes it, thanks to three 
Republican Senators who finally would join with us in moving forward to 
do something about the economy rather than only complain. Then he says 
we need to pass the ordinary budget which was not passed under the 
previous administration. That is what this bill is.

I urge colleagues to take a look at this as undone business from the 
previous administration and the previous Congress that we have to get 
done this week while the temporary spending measures for our Government 
continue.
