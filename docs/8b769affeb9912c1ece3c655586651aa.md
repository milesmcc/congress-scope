Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4986) to provide for the enactment of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, as previously enrolled, with 
certain modifications to address the foreign sovereign immunities 
provisions of title 28, United States Code, with respect to the 
attachment of property in certain judgments against Iraq, the lapse of 
statutory authorities for the payment of bonuses, special pays, and 
similar


benefits for members of the uniformed services, and for other purposes.
