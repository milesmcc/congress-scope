Mr. ELLSWORTH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
outstanding achievements of Terri Poczerwinski from Evansville, 
Indiana. Tomorrow, Mrs. Poczerwinski will be one of four graduates to 
receive the Career College Association's Graduate Recognition for 
Excellence, Achievement and Talent (GREAT) Award. To be selected among 
the 1.8 million students in career colleges across the country is truly 
a remarkable feat.

Mrs. Poczerwinski's story is one of triumph over tragedy. She 
enrolled in the medical assisting program at Indiana Business College 
(IBC) in April 2005. She excelled in her classes even while recovering 
from surgery the beginning of fall term. Then in November 2005, tragedy 
struck when Terri lost her daughter Melinda in the tornadoes that 
ravaged southwest Indiana. Despite struggling with her personal grief, 
Mrs. Poczerwinski continued her hard work and success in the classroom.

Then two days before Thanksgiving and again before Christmas, her 
son-in-law was injured by an improvised exploding device while serving 
in Iraq. But Mrs. Poczerwinski pressed forward, graduating from IBC 
last December with a 3.57 grade point average. She now works at Hebron 
Pediatrics.

I congratulate Mrs. Poczerwinski for her tremendous accomplishments 
in the face of adversity. She is an inspiration to us all.
