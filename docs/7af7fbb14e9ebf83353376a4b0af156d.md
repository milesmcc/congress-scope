Mr. KYL. Mr. Biddle provides a need evaluation of the flaws in the 
Baker-Hamilton. Among those flaws, as he explains, our combat forces 
are restraining the intensity of the violence in Iraq, and removing 
them would cause the violence to rise. This rise in violence would put 
the safety of Americans who remain to train Iraqis in even greater 
jeopardy.

Of course, prematurely withdrawing our troops would have many other 
consequences. Indeed, a sobering assessment of the risks of withdrawal 
is too often missing from debates about the U.S. mission in Iraq.



In this regard, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the July 
17 Washington Post be printed in the Record.
