Mr. HINCHEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend and colleague from 
California for raising this issue, which I think is very important.

We are now confronting a situation in Iraq where the number of our 
military personnel who have been killed is approaching 3,400. Tens of 
thousands of others have been physically wounded, many of them very 
seriously. A good number of those deaths and wounds may be attributed 
to the lack of proper equipment.

We went into that situation, this administration sent our military 
forces into that circumstance there, without properly preparing for 
what they had to confront. In fact, they didn't have any idea what they 
were likely to confront. Many of the issues are that we have not 
developed the kinds of protection, the kinds of equipment, including 
transportation equipment and personal protection equipment, a whole 
host of things that are relevant to this situation, while we spend 
billions of dollars on materials that may have been necessary during 
the Cold War but which are no longer necessary now.

We need what this amendment calls for, a re-evaluation of those 
military activities and equipment, and this is a very simple thing, and 
it should be done.
