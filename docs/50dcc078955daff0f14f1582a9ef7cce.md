Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, let me first say at the outset that I 
support President Obama and his Administration in their overall foreign 
policy objectives and implementation. However, I cannot vote for this 
War Supplemental request because I believe that it does not represent 
the departure from the past that we all hope for and which is urgently 
needed to move our country forward in a new course.

While I understand that there's a momentum building toward winding 
down our involvement in these conflicts and the move away from the war-
making culture, I believe that there must be a sharp departure from 
past policy in order for us to achieve that goal.

This War Supplemental budget will significantly expand our military 
presence in Afghanistan, while at the same time it does not go far 
enough in eliminating our longstanding presence in Iraq, either.

I am very concerned by the fact that almost 90 percent of the funds 
are going for military operations and equipment replacement. While it 
contains some beneficial items like economic development and 
agriculture programs in Afghanistan, efforts to strengthen rule of law 
in Iraq, humanitarian assistance for Gaza--which I strongly support--
wildfire suppression, and efforts to fight against the spread of a new 
flu pandemic, all these items combined amount to less than 13 percent 
of the total budget.

I also believe that funding for the war and military occupation and 
funding for diplomatic, humanitarian and other benevolent efforts must 
be separated. It is disingenuous and deceptive to combine these two and 
force the lawmakers to make the choice they shouldn't have to make; 
that is, supporting funding for the wars in order to get humanitarian 
assistance for Gaza.



President Obama has made strong, inspirational statements that signal 
positive change of policy toward the Muslim world, but this budget will 
send a contradicting message to those statements. Approving this budget 
will send the message to the Muslim world and the international 
community at large that we are not serious in getting to the root-cause 
of the problem, which is our extensive engagement in war-making. At the 
end of the day, the best way to achieve our objectives is to send 
consistent messages that demonstrate our unwavering determination to 
scale down our military footprints.

Supporting this bill will surely perpetuate military operations that 
are likely to fail or become a pyrrhic victory.

President Obama will give a major speech in Egypt on how he would 
reduce those military footprints and increase civilian-led involvement. 
But the figures in this War Supplemental budget, over $75 billion for 
military operations versus merely $7 billion for state and foreign 
operations, will perpetuate the picture of how much we still prioritize 
war-making over diplomacy and development.

With these reasons, and despite my continued support for the 
President and the Administration, I cannot support this War 
Supplemental budget request.
