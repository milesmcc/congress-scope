Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I'd just like to say, when 
things like this happen, you have to ask the question, many ask the 
question, why? Why did this have to happen? Why such a senseless act of 
violence that killed 13 people and wounded 30? Why did they have to 
die, our men and women serving in uniform? And there will be an 
investigation into why, what was the motivation of Mr. Hasan, but 
that's for a later day.

Today we honor these fallen heroes. And when I think about them, I 
think about the mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters who have 
lost their loved ones both in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think the hardest 
thing we have to do as Members of Congress is to comfort these families 
who have lost their loved ones and try to make some sense out of it. 
They know that they have died for a just and noble cause. And, as Mr. 
Edwards knows, my good friend and colleague from Texas who knows so 
many people from the State of Texas that have gone through this 
training facility, one of the greatest in the world, the largest 
military installation in the United States, they are brave.

I know there are many families at home today, many families watching 
the television, some maybe watching this on C-SPAN who are in tears, 
whose hearts are broken, who know that they can't get back what they 
lost. But to those families, know that we in the Congress hear their 
tears. We hear their cries. This resolution stands in strong support of 
them. We emotionally stand behind them, that we have passed legislation 
for both the veterans and active-duty servicemen, in addition to 
posttraumatic disorder.

There are many issues regarding our veterans and our active-duty men 
and women. We are addressing those in this Congress. We are taking care 
of them. In my view, our most solemn obligation under the Constitution 
is for the Congress to not only take care of our veterans returning 
home but to fully support our active men and women serving both in the 
United States and abroad.

With that, let me end by saying God bless them and God bless the 
United States of America.
