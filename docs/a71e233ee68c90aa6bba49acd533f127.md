`Mr. DUNCAN â€” 18 May 2010`

Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, on the Joe Scarborough Show, 
Richard Haass, Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, said China 
had been investing in its economy over the last 10 years while we have 
been investing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr.


Haass proudly described himself as an elitist. Well, it is elitists 
like him and the organization he heads who helped lead to the rush to 
an unnecessary war in Iraq, and continues to push military and civilian 
spending in Iraq and Afghanistan that we simply cannot afford. These 
people apparently are not happy unless we are spending hundreds of 
billions in other countries.

Mr. Haass seemingly did not feel guilty at all when he said China had 
invested in its economy while we have blown a couple of trillion 
dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Well, it's long past time for us to 
bring our troops and contractors home and start investing in our own 
economy. And it is time for us to start putting Americans first and 
stop spending so much money and sending so many jobs to other 
countries.
