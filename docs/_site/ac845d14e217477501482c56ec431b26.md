Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in response to my colleague from the State 
of California--and I thank her for her leadership--there is only one 
amendment today which will end this war, there is only one amendment 
today which will start to bring these troops home, there is only one 
amendment which will make it clear to the Iraqis that this is their 
country and their responsibility. The Feingold-Reid amendment is the 
amendment which will finally start bringing this war to an end.

How many more soldiers do we have to bury? How many more do we have 
to bring into our military and veterans hospitals? How many more 
thousands of innocent Iraqis have to die before we finally accept our 
responsibility to bring this war to an end? We can do it today. We 
should do it today. I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid 
amendment, and I urge all of them to understand the gravity of this 
decision. This is not about politics. This is about the life and death 
of great heroes in America who continue to step forward and risk their 
lives for this Nation.

I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the Feingold-
Reid amendment.
