Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, as military leaders were on the 
Hill explaining how well things were moving in Iraq, news outlets were 
reporting that 171 human beings were killed at a Baghdad market. The 
carnage seems to have no end, even as we see endless U.S. troops 
shipped into an Iraqi shooting gallery.

This Congress has approved a supplemental bill which provides 
everything the President requested and more. In fact, the bill provides 
plentifully, but appropriately, for the wounded who return home every 
month.

The hope is that the President will sign the supplemental as the 
American public desires. Every opinion poll shows that the American 
public wants this war to end. Sign the supplemental.
