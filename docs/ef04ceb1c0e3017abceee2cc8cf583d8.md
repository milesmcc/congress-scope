# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `ef04ceb1c0e3017abceee2cc8cf583d8`
`Mr. WELLER of Illinois â€” 16 February 2007`

Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
this two-sentence non-binding resolution which demoralizes our troops 
in the field while providing aid to our enemy during a time of on-going 
conflict. These brave men and women deserve the full support of their 
government, not second-guessing from politicians in Washington, DC. 
Instead of discussions regarding appropriate funding levels to support 
our troops, the Democratic majority has chosen to rebuke the conduct of 
the war while it is still occurring. This is reckless and ill-advised.

This resolution encourages our enemies to continue provoking our 
fighting men and women. America's enemies around the world are closely 
watching what we say and do today. By passing this non-binding 
resolution, Members of Congress are sending a vote of no confidence to 
our troops in the field and a message of surrender to our enemies.

I strongly believe it is not the place of politicians in Washington 
to devise military tactics and strategy. Congress must not tie the 
hands of our military commanders in the field. You cannot fight a war 
by committee, thousands of miles away. The responsibility of conducting 
America's military strategy and the tactics of our armed forces should 
be left to our military commanders on the ground.

The plan to increase the number of additional troops to the mission 
in Iraq should be given a chance to succeed. These 20,000 additional 
soldiers will assist the Iraqi government in its new, Iraqi-inspired 
security plan. As Prime Minister Maliki said, ''This is 100 percent an 
Iraqi plan under an Iraqi Command.''

The majority of U.S. forces will be deployed to Baghdad to assist in 
maintaining control of areas cleared of terrorists and insurgents. As 
our military commanders in the field have repeatedly told us, part of 
the problem in securing Baghdad comes from the fact that many of the 
insurgents lie in wait until American troops move to another area only 
to emerge and retake precious territory gained by hard battle. By 
having additional troops in the field, the Iraqis will have a better 
chance to capture all of the insurgents, including those who stay 
hidden, waiting to attack again.

Our commanders on the ground have given this plan a green light, and 
I will defer to them to make military decisions. We should keep in mind 
our top commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. David Petraeus, has warned against 
passing this very type of resolution. Our troops have said they want 
the chance to finish the mission that has been started.

Our troops do not want Congress to conduct this war. As one soldier 
posted to a blog on February 5, 2007, ''Proposing to legislate the 
conduct of this long war looks worse than cut and run. It feels like 
the betrayal of the families who bear the burdens.''

Congress should not tell our soldiers how to conduct a war any more 
than Congress should tell a lawyer how to argue a case or a doctor how 
to perform a surgery. Congress's place is to support our troops by 
providing the funding they need to finish the mission that was started. 
If my colleagues are so strongly opposed to the mission in Iraq, they 
can vote to cut the funding of our soldiers in harm's way.

We must recognize the War on Terror requires perseverance and 
patience. American patience, however, is not infinite. The lack of 
visible progress in Iraq is deeply troubling. The Iraqi conflict has a 
crucial role in the war against al Qaeda. American troops are stemming 
the tide of a worsening situation. Failure in Iraq is simply not an 
option. It is important we in Congress demonstrate quickly our ability 
to win in Iraq before the situation gets worse.


This may well represent the Administration's last chance to 
demonstrate sustainable progress is securing the country. It is equally 
important; however, that Iraqis take ownership for their own country. 
Our troops, in whatever number, are not there permanently. The Iraqis 
must take an active role in shaping their country's future. Americans 
took control of America after the American Revolution; the Iraqis must 
do the same. The Iraqis must be made to recognize the need for Iraqis 
to control the future of their nation. Iraq's future should not be 
determined by Americans, only the Iraqis can and should do that.

In closing, I believe in and support our American troops. They have 
made tremendous progress in Iraq and should be commended for the 
actions towards making Iraq a country for the Iraqis. Since the 
declaration of the Global War on Terror, our brave men and women have 
worked hard to stem the tide of a worsening situation. Because of them, 
elections have been held in both Afghanistan and Iraq; the terrorist 
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has been killed, former Iraqi dictator Saddam 
Hussein was captured, tried and executed, and more than three-quarters 
of al Qaeda's known leaders and associates have been detained or 
killed.

At the same time, Iraqis must assume responsibility for their 
country. Americans will not stay in Iraq forever; Iraqis must assume 
control of their country. We must recognize the War on Terror requires 
perseverance and patience. American patience, however, is not infinite. 
The Iraqi conflict has a crucial role in the war against al Qaeda and 
American troops are stemming the tide of a worsening situation. 
However, I believe the Iraqi people must take an active role in shaping 
their country's future. Iraq's future should not be determined by 
Americans, only the Iraqis can and should do that.
