 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I would like to commemorate 
the life of a great soldier, strategic thinker and American, LTG 
William Odom. I was deeply saddened to learn of his recent sudden 
death.

General Odom served our country with honor and distinction throughout 
his life. During his time serving as a military adviser in the White 
House, Director of the National Security Agency, and West Point and 
Yale professor, General Odom demonstrated an uncanny talent for 
assessing and advancing U.S. interests in a complex and challenging 
world.

Over the years, the U.S. Congress has benefited greatly from General 
Odom's clear vision of U.S. interests in the Middle East. General Odom 
was a strong critic of the Iraq war even before it began. It is 
unfortunate that more Members of this body did not heed his insightful 
and prescient warnings of the perils of invading Iraq. His steadfast 
commitment to ending the war and restoring a balanced and focused 
national security strategy has been an inspiration. So, too, was his 
strong opposition to the President's illegal warrantless wiretapping 
program.

Our thoughts are with his wife, son, and family during this difficult 
time. I hope that they can take some comfort knowing that he will be 
deeply missed by a grateful Nation.
