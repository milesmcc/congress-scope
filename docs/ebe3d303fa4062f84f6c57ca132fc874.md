Mr. KENNEDY. I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Burton, 
for his work on this, acknowledging the families of those who have died 
really in combat, because these suicides are a result of combat.

And the greatest signature wound in this war on terrorism in Iraq and 
Afghanistan is a wound that involves both the psyche with traumatic 
brain injury, with the concussions they are serving as a result of 
these IEDs--improvised explosive devices--and the stress and strain of 
constantly worrying about your life being in jeopardy, which is 
posttraumatic stress.

And there's nothing that is abnormal about having the stress of 
worrying about your life being taken, and these people have to live 
with it constantly nonstop because this country keeps asking them to go 
back and back and back and back again.

This is something that's long overdue. I thank the gentleman from 
Indiana. Let's study, let's serve, let's make the commitment not to 
forget the families left behind as a result of these terrible 
tragedies.
