`Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts â€” 26 September 2008`

Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
our time.

Mr. Speaker, I have been here for 20 years. I want to tell you 
something today. This is a good piece of legislation. This deals with 
the energy needs of the country, and I want to say to my friend, Mr. 
Camp, I consulted with him on major portions of this legislation. There 
are provisions in this legislation that Mr. Camp and I worked hand-in-
glove on.

We are here this morning where the minority side says, ''Well, we 
have to check with the President.'' We didn't get elected to be members 
of the executive branch; we got elected to be Members of the 
legislative branch. Every


school child in America knows that. Since when do we submit here 
without asking any questions of the executive to the whims of what they 
might want to do?

I want to say this today. The reason that historians will write about 
the last 7/1/2/ years being as difficult as it has been for the 
American people, including what is in front of this Nation today, is 
because the minority today, who were the majority for the first 6 years 
of the Bush administration, they abdicated their responsibility.

The job of this body is to occasionally ask a question of the 
President of the United States. Instead, it was, ''Yes, Mr. 
President.''

''Can we move quickly enough, Mr. President?''

''Weapons of mass destruction? Yes, Mr. President.''

''Invasion of Iraq? Yes, Mr. President.''

''$2.3 trillion worth of tax cuts? Yes, Mr. President.''

''Regulations thrown out the window? Yes, Mr. President.''

Since when do Members of this body ask themselves is it okay with the 
United States Senate? Is it okay with the President of the United 
States?

Our job here is to help the 660,000 people that sent us here, and 
that means occasionally clearing your throat and saying, ''No, Mr. 
President.''

This bill addresses many fundamental issues for the American people. 
The R&D tax credit is very important. When the Senate says to us 
they're not going to act on our legislation if we don't get it over 
there by 11 o'clock, they haven't even submitted a bill to us to act 
upon.

This deference all of a sudden to the United States Senate surprises 
me. We have a separate responsibility here to move forward with what we 
believe to be in the best interest of the American people and not to 
accept automatically what the executive branch says or what the Senate 
says.

I've been associated with some good legislation, and from time to 
time perhaps in this body over two decades, some not-so-good 
legislation. This, Mr. Speaker, is a good piece of legislation, and the 
minority was included in the writing of this legislation.
