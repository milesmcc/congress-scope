Mr. MURTHA. The Center's analytical tools were developed at NDIC and 
are among the best in the industry, performing over 500 missions 
involving drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, fraud in the 
health care industry, and child abduction. Today, the NDIC document 
exploitation program analysts are supporting the U.S. Army to 
facilitate criminal investigations being conducted in Iraq.

NDIC developed computer software. It was recently adopted by the U.S. 
Army in Iraq to exploit valuable information from captured computers of 
insurgents and members of al Qaeda.

And let me say to the gentleman how this started. President Bush felt 
we needed a centralized place, and they wanted to put it in Washington. 
I felt, with a new communications, we didn't need it in Washington, and 
they decided to put it in Johnstown, and I think it has done very well. 
And we have argued this before, so I oppose the amendment.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
