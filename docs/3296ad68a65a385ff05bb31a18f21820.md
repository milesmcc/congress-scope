Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend from 
Illinois in a minute.

We are happy to debate the Iraq issue. We have always been happy to 
do it. Thirty-five times we have, and that is 35 times more than when 
the Republicans were in the majority. The war went on for years with no 
oversight, none whatsoever. We have at least demanded that, and I think 
it is important we have done that.

I would also ask my Republican colleagues, why don't they ever talk 
about the costs of this war? The costs in life, bodily injury, and 
money--money that is keeping this country from taking care of its own?
