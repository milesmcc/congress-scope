Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday President Bush called the 
timetable a ''prescription for chaos and confusion.'' That timetable 
was a responsible road map out of Iraq.

The President has caused chaos and confusion for 4 long years, 
replacing one general after another when the general disagrees with the 
policy.

What has the President given us? He's given us the largest deficit in 
history. He's cut back from domestic programs to pay for this war. He's 
weakened our military. Eighty-eight percent of the National Guard is 
not prepared to go to war. The Army is strained to a breaking point.

He's neglected our own people, and he has destroyed Iraq's economy, 
their social fabric. People are leaving Iraq, fleeing from the chaos 
the President has caused for 4 long years.

We had a responsible road map. The President should have signed it.
