# BUSH ADMINISTRATION SHOULD NOT BE NICKEL-AND-DIMING AMERICA'S INJURED  SOLDIERS

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, The Washington Post headlines said it best: 
''Rotten Homecoming--This is no way to treat a veteran.''

A 4-month Washington Post investigation found frustrating delays some 
of our returning soldiers are facing in receiving the compensation they 
are owed for the service to this Nation. One soldier was sent to Walter 
Reed after being smashed in the head by a steel cargo door of an 18-
wheeler near the Iraqi border. Now the Pentagon is saying that the 
soldier's mental impairment comes from his being slow in high school, 
not from the dramatic head injury he suffered in combat.

Madam Speaker, this Congress has already begun investigating the 
outrageous problems our soldiers are facing at Walter Reed. President 
Bush cannot send them off to battle without properly caring for them 
when they return home.
