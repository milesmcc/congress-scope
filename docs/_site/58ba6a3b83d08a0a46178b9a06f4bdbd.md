Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Andrews for 
supporting this amendment and offering me the time to rise in support 
of increasing reporting requirements and Congressional oversight of 
defense acquisition systems. I thank Chairwoman Slaughter of the Rules 
Committee for making this amendment in order, and also to Chairman 
Skelton and Mr. Andrews for bringing H.R. 5013 forward and supporting 
the amendment. I would also like to thank the staff of the House Armed 
Services Committee and the Office of Legislative Counsel for helping 
draft this amendment.

I am pleased that we are addressing this critical issue. Last year 
when Congress reformed defense weapons procurement, we tackled only 
about 20 cents of each dollar that this Nation spends on defense 
contracting. The other 80 percent is on non-weapons system contracts. 
This amounts to more than $1 billion a day.

Today's bill may seems to address the less glamorous side of defense 
spending until you remember our men and women in uniform rely every day 
on contractors to provide them with meals, equipment, and even health 
care. Increased accountability for these service contracts is critical 
to the well-being of our soldiers and to ensuring that the taxpayers 
are not on the hook for wasteful spending.

As the Representative for New York's 19th Congressional District, I 
am also well aware of importance of this sort of defense spending since 
I have the honor and privilege of representing the United States 
military academy at West Point and serving on its board of visitors.

West Point does not develop major weapons systems, but it does 
develop the Army's next generation of leaders. The cadets at West Point 
rely on exactly the services and products covered by this bill. They, 
and all service men and women, deserve to know that they are getting 
the best.

This amendment would require the DOD to include the performance 
assessments required by H.R. 5013 in an annual report to Congress, 
similar to provisions in last year's weapons systems


procurement bill. It also requires that DOD report to Congress when it 
uncovers a particularly egregious problem.

When I visited Afghanistan last April, I talked to soldiers from all 
over New York and asked them what they needed, what Congress could do 
to improve their lives. I expected to hear more about MRAPs or shorter 
tours of duty. Instead, they told me they wanted more shower facilities 
with more hot water that works, and faster Internet broadband 
connections so they could talk with their families. These services 
which we take for granted provide a slice of home life and comfort to 
our troops serving in the most difficult of circumstances.

This amendment will help ensure Congress is made aware of defense 
acquisition systems that are not delivering a useful service to our men 
and women in uniform, or are wasting taxpayer funds. Prompt knowledge 
of the worst offenders will help Congress better address these issues. 
Our soldiers serving overseas and here at home and the cadets at West 
Point deserve no less. Their safety, comfort and health depend on it, 
and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying 
bill.

I reserve the balance of my time.
