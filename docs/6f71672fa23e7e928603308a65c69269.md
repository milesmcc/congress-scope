Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress to fight for new jobs, 
protect the retirement security of America's seniors, and give middle 
class families a fair shake in this economy. Yet our efforts, the basic 
bricks in the foundation of a working economy, have been cast aside by 
my Republican colleagues.

The Republicans have sweetened the tax deal today by demanding that 
American taxpayers fork over $26 billion for an estate tax break that 
will go to about 6,600 families. I offer some perspective.

There are more than 6,600 people in Century Village, King's Point, 
and each of the major retirement communities I represent. There are 
more undergraduates at Florida Atlantic University in my district. And 
my teenage daughters and their high school friends are together on 
track to have more than 6,600 Facebook friends.

And $26 billion? 16.2 million Americans who depend on food stamps to 
eat could eat for a year. 3.5 million American college students at our 
public universities could see their tuition paid in full. And most 
striking, more than $175,000 could go to each of the 140,000 families 
whose sons and daughters are serving in Afghanistan and Iraq.

We can do better, Mr. Speaker.
