`Mr. KINGSTON â€” 1 July 2010`

---


Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I just want to make this point about H.R. 
4899 and the Senate amendment. It's that it gives a clean bill and a 
bill that will unfetter the generals so they can do the right thing. 
They have worked closely with the administration.

As we know, the transition from McChrystal to Petraeus has probably 
been traumatic or tenuous enough on all of us on a bipartisan basis, 
and at this time we don't need to add to the military woes in the 
international efforts in Afghanistan by sending a bill, which, 
incidentally, is not going to be signed by the President. The President 
has already said he is going to veto it, and the Senate is not going to 
pass it anyway, so why are we doing this on the eve of the Fourth of 
July?



We need to have a clean bill. That is why I think, Mr. Speaker, the 
best thing for us to do is take H.R. 4899 with the Senate amendment and 
concur with the Senate resolution.
