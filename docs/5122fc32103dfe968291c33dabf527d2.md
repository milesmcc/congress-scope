`Mr. CASEY â€” 12 March 2008`

Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am going to speak to two amendments that 
I have at the desk that I will be able to talk more about tomorrow. But 
I wished to describe them tonight.

First of all, amendment No. 4171 is an amendment that focuses on a 
problem we see all around us. It seems we cannot go too long in a week 
when we do not pick up a newspaper that talks about the safety of the 
food we eat. It has been an issue of concern for Americans and 
certainly from people in my home State of Pennsylvania.

Over the past year, there have been a steady stream of news reports 
on countless incidents of recalled or otherwise contaminated food 
products.

To mention a few: Spinach contaminated with E. coli; peanut butter 
contaminated with salmonella; imported fish containing high levels of 
antibiotics; and, finally, culminating last month with the largest meat 
recall in the history of the United States, 143 million pounds of 
ground beef.

The safety of our food supply is an issue we can no longer afford to 
ignore. My amendment would expand the deficit-neutral reserve fund to 
allow for legislation that enhances the protection and safety of the 
Nation's food supply.

The funds of this legislation would allow for congressional action. 
It would do the following: First of all, expand Federal food inspection 
field forces; second, develop risk-based approaches to inspecting the 
food supply; third, develop the infrastructure to ensure a coordinated 
Federal food safety approach; No. 4, we would enhance the Food and Drug 
Administration's recall authority; and, finally, expand food-borne 
illness awareness and education programs.

This is a critically important issue, and I know the current 
cosponsors include Senator Grassley, who is on the floor with us 
tonight; Senators Durbin, Brown, Schumer, Lautenberg. So that is the 
food safety amendment No. 4171. I would urge my colleagues to support 
that amendment.















 Amendment No. 4172


The second amendment is No. 4172, the Wounded Warriors Bonus Equity 
Act. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan amendment to the budget 
resolution calling for payment of bonuses to troops who have retired or 
separated for combat-related injuries.

I wish to thank Senator Clinton and Senator Sessions for agreeing to 
be original cosponsors on this amendment. The three of us introduced 
legislation in December of last year in response to reports that 
wounded troops were asked by the Department of Defense to return their 
enlistment bonus. I will say that again. These were troops asked by the 
Department of Defense to return their enlistment bonuses after they 
retired or separated from the Armed Services due to combat-related 
injuries.

These troops and tens of thousands of others across the country that 
were injured in Iraq are struggling to support themselves and their 
families. We owe them what we promised, and we must not drop our 
commitment to our troops at the shoreline of the United States.

The Senate passed our bill, S. 2400, the Wounded Warriors Bonus 
Equity Act, last year by unanimous consent. But we have not reconciled 
our version with that of the House of Representatives which does not 
require retroactive payment of the bonus that has already been withheld 
or returned.

I wished to commend Congressman Jason Altmire from my home State of 
Pennsylvania, in the Fourth District, who helped bring this problem to 
light when one of our constituents faced the loss of his enlistment 
bonus.

I am hopeful that expanding the deficit-neutral reserve fund for 
veterans and wounded servicemembers will include legislation that will 
require the Department of Defense to return promised bonus payments and 
conduct an audit to identify any servicemembers who are owed payments.

This will pave the way for signing this legislation into law. We have 
often heard the words of Abraham Lincoln when he talked about those who 
perished in war, those who gave the last full measure of devotion.

He also spoke, in his Presidency, of those who have been injured in 
war. He talked about those who have borne the battle and what we owe 
them. Abraham Lincoln was right. We owe them much. The least we can say 
is we owe them, to fulfill the promise we made to them for those who 
have indeed borne the battle.

I would urge all my colleagues to support this amendment as well, 
amendment No. 4172, the Wounded Warriors Bonus Equity Act.
