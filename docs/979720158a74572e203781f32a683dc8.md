Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.

Mr. Chairman, it's been an interesting process these last, give or 
take, 24 hours. As a freshman legislator who spent 24 years in the 
Tennessee State senate, in those 24 years in the senate I saw the 
parties work together. Democrats and Republicans worked together for 
the betterment of our State. We had Republican governors. We had 
Democratic governors. We had Republican and Democratic legislators.

What America wants is for the parties to work together. On most of 
the bills we've had, they were brought by Democrats, and it's been 
called a Democratic Congress, but many of the bills that were passed by 
this Congress were done in a bipartisan way.

There were Republicans who voted for stem cell, not a majority, I 
believe, but Republicans voted for the stem cell research. There were 
some Republicans who even voted for the minimum wage. There were 
Republicans who thought prescription drug prices should come down. 
There were Republicans who even cared about college loans being brought 
down. There were bipartisan efforts to bring about progress.

There was much less bipartisanship in the effort to save lives in 
Iraq and end that wasteful and unfortunate policy we have in the Middle 
East, but--however, there was bipartisanship.

During this debate, one of the most serious requests debates we could 
have, the Homeland Security bill to protect us from natural disasters, 
to protect us from foreign enemies and terrorists, we have gotten into 
the most divisive partisan debate that I've seen in this Congress in 
the 5 months I've been here.

Much of the debate has not been about the Homeland Security bill, 
unfortunately, Mr. Chairman. It's been about attempts to attack our 
Speaker, the first woman ever elected Speaker of this House of 
Representatives, a great day in this country when the glass ceiling was 
broken, when a great lady was put in this position, the highest 
position a woman has ever been in in the legislative body in the 
history of the United States. To try to tear down the Speaker, trying 
to tear down the party and trying to bring up other issues, rather than 
talking about Homeland Security.

Yesterday, Congressman Arcuri spoke, a former prosecutor. He said, 
you know, in opening statements if a person talks about the facts, 
they've got a case. And if they talk about things other than the facts, 
they don't. And the opposition party has not talked about the facts. 
They've brought up everything but the facts of the Homeland Security 
bill. They really haven't shown where there are problems with this 
bill.

The previous speaker, Mr. Chairman, talked about, used all the buzz 
words, the buzz words of ''slush fund,'' ''pet projects,'' ''pork'' and 
others.

The truth of the matter is, Mr. Chairman, and he knows it as well as 
everybody else knows it, he's not against those things. He just wants 
his slush fund, his pet projects and his pork. And when people throw 
those terms out, because that's not what they are, they are Congress 
citing specific needs to be placed in the law to that represent their 
districts. But then what he does is disparage government.

I have spent my life in government, my entire life, and I've found it 
a great calling, and I think we should all try to make people think 
more and better about government and have young people see this as a 
high calling, Mr. Chairman. There are young people in our audience. 
They should see this as a place where they want to serve and see 
government as working, and I think some of them do.

But to use these terms in a disparaging way when what the party's 
trying to do is to say, we want our share, we want our earmarks, not 
pork, but our earmarks, is wrong. And it's wrong when you take the oath 
of office to uphold the Constitution. You should be upholding 
government and supporting government.

And it's unfortunate we've seen this. This has been a low point in 
the Congress since I've been here.

I am proud to be a part of this Congress. There are many Members on 
the other side of the aisle that I'm proud to serve with as well. There 
are some very, very fine people, and I'm sure the gentlemen who have 
spoken today are all fine people.

But we need to rise above some of this partisanship, try to pass this 
Homeland Security bill, protect our country, and inspire people to 
serve in government and realize that it's a process, and the process 
involves the Senate, and it involves the executive, it involves both 
sides of the aisle. And to try to tear down one side tears down 
government in general. We're all part of the process, and I wish we'd 
work together and pass this bill.

We were up till 2 o'clock this morning because of seven moves to rise 
and have the committee adjourn. All seven failed. They knew they were 
all going to fail. And it was a burden on the staff, it was a burden on 
the Congress, and probably a burden on people that wanted to watch 
something else on C-SPAN last night.

But with that, Mr. Chairman, I just encourage our colleagues to 
support this bill, to protect America and to have a debate that is 
germane to the issues concerning homeland security.
