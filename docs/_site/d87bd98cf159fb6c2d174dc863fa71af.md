Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank my Chair of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee.

The legislation before us today is not about politics. It's about 
providing children's health care coverage to 10 million low-income 
American children.

This bill is paid for. It's paid for more than the $190 billion the 
President's asking for a supplemental to support the war in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. This is for the ten million children and parents who are 
hardworking Americans but cannot afford private health insurance.

The bill is clear on undocumented children. No Federal funding will 
be spent on undocumented immigrants.

The bill is clear on childless adults. For 1 year they get coverage, 
and these adults actually got a waiver, these States got a waiver to 
cover these adults. So they're going to have 1 year, and then they're 
off of it.

The bill is clear on family income. Only the lowest-income children 
are covered with a prohibition on coverage of children above 300 
percent. You can't go above 300 percent. Most are at 200 percent, but 
some are at 300.

Madam Speaker, 4 months of spending in Iraq is enough to provide 
SCHIP to 10 million children for 5 years. More than 80 percent of the 
American people support it, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

We've prioritized it to the low-income.

We've prioritized it to citizens.

We've prioritized children.

It's about priorities, not politics, and the Congress should be able 
to put aside politics and unite behind these priorities for our 
children.
