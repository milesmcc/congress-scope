# DEMOCRATS' NEW DIRECTION IS NOT NEW

`Mr. McHENRY â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. McHENRY. After months of campaigning against ''Stay the Course,'' 
the Democrats are proposing just that, a stay-the-course resolution 
here on the House floor. Their Iraq resolution does not have the force 
of law, and in fact, this nonbinding resolution is simply a mealy-mouth 
attempt to appease their Democrat leftist base.

Democrats have held 52 hearings on Iraq since taking control of 
Congress. So let me get this right. The Democrats have held 52 hearings 
so they can show one resolution on the House floor that has no bearing 
on the President's policy, does not have the force of law, does not 
advocate the withdrawal of troops, and does nothing except have a 
tantrum here on the House floor. So please explain this new direction, 
Madam Speaker. This is not a new direction, it is political posturing 
of the worst kind.

Madam Speaker, where is your plan? Where is your plan for victory in 
Iraq? Where is your plan for success and national security?
