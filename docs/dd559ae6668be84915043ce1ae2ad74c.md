Mr. COBLE. I thank the gentlelady from Florida for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I voted against the surge. And for 2/1/2/ years, I have 
said that we need to keep the troop withdrawal issue on the table, but 
I have also said during that time that the date for withdrawal should 
be reserved for the commanders on the ground.

The bill before us was not introduced until yesterday, and in my 
opinion, it is vague, at best; generously laced again, in my opinion, 
with politics.

I excel at an understatement, Mr. Speaker, when I declare that this 
war has been mismanaged. It was appropriate to remove Saddam, an 
international terrorist, but there was never, in my opinion, a post-
entry strategy; therefore, mismanagement.

The Iraq issue, Mr. Speaker, is neither as favorable as its 
proponents contend, nor as unfavorable as its opponents profess. The 
good news is the evil-driven terrorists have not attacked us again. And 
I am confident that many moderate Muslims do not embrace the useless 
killing and destruction of property that has occurred in Iraq, but 
their silent vocal opposition has been disappointing, at best. The 
Iraqi Government has been disappointing as well, and we need to insist 
upon more compliance it seems to me.

But given all the facts surrounding this matter, Mr. Speaker, I 
believe this Chamber is well-advised to wait until September. We're 
told that the general will be here in September to report what, if any, 
favorable or unfavorable results have occurred since the surge, and I 
believe that is our best policy today.

The cost has been enormous, as has been said, and we would be remiss 
if we tried to deny that. But I think the right vote is against this 
proposal today, and then let's revisit it subsequently when the general 
comes before us in September.
