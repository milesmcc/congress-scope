`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 26 June 2008`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add briefly that we are on a 
glidepath to completion here of a number of extremely important 
measures to our country, from the supplemental, which will fund the war 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, which also includes an important new veterans 
benefit program; to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which 
has helped protect us against attacks since 9/11; to an important 
Medicare bill, which will be resolved in one way or another in the next 
few weeks; to an important housing bill. In each of these instances, we 
will end up getting a bipartisan result at some point in the very near 
future on very important issues for the American people. So I think 
today has been very successful in crafting a pathway--a glidepath, if 
you will--to completion. I share the majority leader's view that this 
was a day of considerable accomplishment on major issues for the 
American people.

I yield the floor.
