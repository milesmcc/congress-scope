`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 20 March 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Another thing that is so very, very important, 
is his name David Broder, the conservative writer? I was home reading a 
hometown paper. Some folks in this town admit that they do not read the 
paper, but I do, and he wrote an article saying no blank checks out of 
this Congress, and it talked about oversight hearings and talked about 
what is happening in Justice, Mr. Speaker, and it talked about what is 
happening in some of the other Federal agencies. But he ended the 
article by saying it really does not change government. It does. This 
is where he is wrong. It does.

Half of the things that we know now about Walter Reed, most of the 
things that we know now about the Iraq war is that the Congress is now 
carrying out its constitutional responsibility, and that is to have 
oversight. So I just wanted to, just if we continue like Mr. Ryan was 
saying, listening to these voices of the past, saying let us stay in 
the same direction, oh, do not worry about having oversight hearings, 
where were these voices when folks were giving away millions of dollars 
in special interest tax cuts to the superwealthy and to the 
superconnected? So I think it is important we are on the right track.
