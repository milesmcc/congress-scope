Mr. WARNER. Well, I was going to speak on that later tonight when I 
address my colleagues and point to the Congressional Record today, 
which contains the amendment by Senator Lugar and myself. But, 
essentially, we bring to the attention of the Senate and provide the 
following language for the President, if I may read it, on page S 9224 
of Friday's Congressional Record, in our section:




 The findings that supported H.J. Res. 114, Public Law 107-


 243, which was enacted in 2002 and which authorized the 


 President to use the Armed Forces of the United States 


 against Iraq, require review and revision.


So, Senator, I have gone on record, together with my colleague, 
Senator Lugar, that this is necessary, and we further call on the 
President--and I read the bill.
