Mr. INHOFE. Well, let me just suggest to you, I think if the defining 
moment--if you really agreed with what MoveOn.org did and what they 
said and how they demeaned one of the finest officers in the history of 
this country--the guy has a Ph.D. from Princeton; he is not just a 
normal person. The guy was unanimously agreed to and supported by the 
group here to go and do this work and take over the war in Iraq. This 
is the right guy for the right time. Huge successes are taking place.

I listened with some interest this morning to the House Foreign 
Relations subcommittee proceedings yesterday, and the very people who 
were complaining that General Petraeus consulted with the White House 
to come up with his information are now saying he should have consulted 
with White House and did not do it. You can't have it both ways.

I would just say this: The vote we are about to take is not a vote on 
an amendment by Senator Boxer; it is a vote as to whether you agree 
with MoveOn.org coming in and saying the things they have articulated 
about one of our top military leaders. That is what the vote is all 
about.

I urge everyone to oppose the Boxer amendment.
