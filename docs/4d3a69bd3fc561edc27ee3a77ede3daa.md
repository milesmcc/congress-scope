`Mr. ARCURI â€” 10 May 2007`

---


Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to just respond to my colleague 
from California saying that we can't win the war on 2-month funding 
intervals. I would submit we have now been at this Iraq war longer than 
it took us to win World War II when we were fighting both Japan and 
Germany, and still we are no closer, and, I would submit, further from 
what they define as ''victory.''

I, like so many Americans, have tried to be patient with this 
administration in extricating us from the difficulties we find 
ourselves in in Iraq. They first told us there were weapons of mass 
destruction. None were found, yet we were still patient. Then they told 
us we were there to remove a tyrant. We removed Saddam Hussein, yet we 
are still there, and we continue to be patient. They told us we were 
there to fight terrorism, and we have been fighting terrorism, and we 
still remain patient.

Now they tell us that we are there to make our families safer. Well, 
I don't feel that my family is any safer as a result of our being in 
Iraq. And like the American people, I am losing patience with the 
hollow promises that this administration has made about getting us out 
of Iraq.

I rise today in support of this rule because I think that it is time 
that we change the course, we change the direction. How many strategies 
is this administration going to adopt before they arrive at success?

Last night in the Rules Committee I got to thinking as we were 
discussing this rule about my own children, about my family, and I 
thought about how would my children look at me later in life, how would 
my grandchildren look at me later on, in terms of how we tried to stop 
this conflict in Iraq. Then I thought about a situation that I talked 
about a lot during my campaign.

During my campaign, when I was trying to decide whether or not I 
would run, my son and my daughter, who are both teenagers, were not 
supportive of that. One day my son said to me, Dad, what is it that a 
Congressman does? I started telling my son what a Congressman does.

He said, Dad, are you saying that if you get to Congress, you will be 
able to stop the war in Iraq?

I said, Not alone, but certainly with the other Members of Congress.

He said then, I really think that you should run for Congress, 
because the war in Iraq is a bad thing and too many people are dying.

My son, then 15 years old, got it. He understood what it was about. 
He understood that we are in Iraq for the wrong reason. He understood 
that it was time to change the course and change the direction.

That is why I rise today. I rise because I support the rule that will 
get us out of Iraq, but, more importantly, because my children know 
that it is the right thing to do.
