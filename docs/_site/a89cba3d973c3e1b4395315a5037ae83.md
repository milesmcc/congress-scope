Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of 
International Women's Month, which this year we celebrated during the 
month of March.

Throughout the month, we have passed legislation recognizing the 
impact women have had on our Nation and the world itself. We have heard 
speeches honoring these individuals who have made life richer and 
better.

As March comes to a close, I want to individually honor several women 
from my home state of Nebraska who have made a difference.

I also want to encourage all Members of Congress to help celebrate 
International Women's Month all year long, through education, support, 
and service.

Throughout Nebraska's history, we have been fortunate to have had a 
number of exceptional women call our State home. It is in their name 
and the names of the exceptional women yet to come that we celebrate 
this month--and all year long.

Names such as Louise Pound, Willa Cather, and Mari Sandoz spring 
readily to mind when discussing Nebraska women who have opened minds 
and imaginations.

But during times of change, women such as children's crusader Grace 
Abbott and journalist Rheta ChiIde Dorr--the first woman to cover World 
War I from the front lines--have served as inspirations.

The first American Indian woman doctor was Dr. Susan LaFlesche 
Picotte. The hospital she built in Walthill is now called the Picotte 
Center.

Nebraska women have also shouldered leadership for our State. Senator 
JoAnn Maxey was the first African American to serve as State Senator. 
Senators Fern Orme and Florence Reynolds also deserve mention.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention Governor Kay Orr, who was 
elected the first Republican woman Governor in the United States, or 
Rep. Virginia Smith, who set the standard for all House Members, not 
just from the Third District of Nebraska.

Finally, we should also honor the women who served in our armed 
forces and who put their lives at risk for our freedom. In particular, 
let us remember Sgt. 1st Class Linda Ann Tarango-Griess and Staff Sgt. 
Tricia Jameson, who lost their lives in Operation Iraqi Freedom and who 
called Nebraska home.

Our country is blessed to have freedoms so many areas of the world 
unfortunately do not. We have the freedom to succeed, and many women 
through our history have done just that. Now is the time to encourage 
the next generation to follow in their footsteps.
