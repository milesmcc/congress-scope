Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the Washington Post has 
usually been associated with the Democratic Party. Today's lead 
editorial is especially courageous in criticizing the Democratic plan 
for Iraq.

I would like to draw to your attention the following: ''In short, the 
Democratic proposal being taken up this week is an attempt to impose 
detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself. Will 
Iraq collapse into unrestrained civil conflict with massive civilian 
casualties, as the U.S. intelligence community predicts, in the event 
of rapid withdrawal? Will al Qaeda establish a powerful new base for 
launching attacks on the United States and its allies? Ms. Pelosi's 
strategy leads not toward a responsible withdrawal from Iraq, but to a 
constitutional struggle with Mr. Bush, who has already said he will 
veto the legislation.''

Members of both parties should acknowledge the point of this 
editorial. Al Qaeda spokesman for Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, has 
clearly identified that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central fronts in 
the global war on terrorism. To undermine Iraq as clearly part of a 
global war puts American families at risk.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
