Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, today the House of Representatives 
recognizes the service and sacrifice of the members of the United 
States Coast Guard and the United States Marine Corps who were 
tragically killed during exercises off the coast of California three 
weeks ago.

On October 29, 2009, a Coast Guard C-130 plane and a Marine AH-1 
Cobra helicopter collided off the coast of Southern California. The 
Marine pilots were conducting training about 15 miles off San Clemente 
Island when they collided with the U.S. Coast Guard plane, which was 
based out of the Coast Guard Air Station in Sacramento, CA.

These brave Marines and Coast Guardsmen dedicated their lives to 
protecting our freedom and safety. Such tragedies are a reminder of the 
dangers all men and women of our armed forces face, whether they are 
stationed in Afghanistan, California, or anywhere else in the world.

H. Res. 891 offers Members of the House of Representatives an 
appropriate opportunity to express our thoughts and prayers to families 
and friends of these service members. Our hearts are with them during 
this difficult period.
