`Mr. INOUYE â€” 26 January 2010`

---


Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma proposes to cut 
$20 billion from programs which he describes as being redundant. Well, 
take, for example, nursing. There are three different programs. They 
are not redundant. One is for education; another is to train women and 
men to go to rural areas, rural America, to serve; and the third is for 
research. Yes, three different agencies handle that. It is for three 
different purposes.

Then you have HUD. One of the sad facts of life is that tonight 
658,000 American men, women, and children are going to go to bed 
homeless, some of them with empty stomachs, some without blankets, and 
we are going to cut 5 percent from housing for the homeless? This 
amendment does that.

Then you have cuts for foreign operations. Senator Leahy spent some 
time this afternoon explaining why this is foolish. We had an 
accounting change because now we cover State Department activities in 
Afghanistan and Iraq.

I think it is ill-advised to do what the Senator proposes because 
these are not redundant. These are not wasteful. I think we could be 
spending more for the homeless, but yet we are cutting this by this 
amendment. I hope we reject this amendment.
