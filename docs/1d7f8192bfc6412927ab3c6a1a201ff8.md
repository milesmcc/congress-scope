# HONORING PRIVATE JASON WATSON

Mr. FLEMING. I would like to take this privileged opportunity to 
honor and celebrate the life of Private Jason Watson. Private Watson is 
from Many, Louisiana, and recently died in Afghanistan.

Private Watson gave that last full measure of devotion to defend our 
freedom, and his death is a reminder of the cost of our liberty. 
Remember that it's not the Congressman and it's not the reporter who 
guarantee freedom of speech, it's the uniformed servicemembers working 
every day.

He proudly defended America so that we may never experience the 
horror of another terrorist attack on our home soil. While little will 
comfort the pain his family feels at this time, I want to thank them on 
behalf of our country, a grateful country, and let them know that their 
family will be in our prayers.

Private Jason Watson died a hero. I challenge my colleagues to 
remember our role here in Congress to make responsible decisions to 
protect the lives of Americans and to uphold the values and the pillars 
of freedom this brave young man died for.
