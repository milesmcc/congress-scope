`Mr. CONAWAY â€” 9 March 2007`

---


Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate a great American. Mr. Daniel J. Hollmann of Odessa, Texas, 
has been a community leader in Odessa and the Permian Basin for more 
than three decades. A small businessman, family man and steadfast 
volunteer, Dan is one of the shining stars in the Eleventh 
Congressional District of Texas.

April 1 of this year marks the 30th anniversary of Dan receiving his 
license to practice law and the founding of his own firm, now Hollmann, 
Lyon, Patterson and Durell. Reaching this milestone is a great 
achievement, and I congratulate him for showing the hard work and 
perseverance I know it takes to run a small business.

I would also like to recognize and congratulate Dan as the 2006 
recipient of the Odessa Chamber of Commerce's Outstanding Citizen of 
the Year Award. The award, given to the chamber member who best 
represents the collective goals of the business community of Odessa, 
was given to Dan because of his extensive volunteer history to the 
community and involvement in volunteerism that led to this award.

He has donated legal services to various nonprofit organizations, 
including the Formation of Court Appointed Special Advocates of Ector 
County and Catholic Charities Community Services, and is a proud 
supporter of many public school booster clubs, ranging from the Permian 
High School Choir Booster Club to the Odessa High School Basketball 
Booster Club.

Again, I congratulate my friend Daniel J. Hollmann on all of these 
achievements and thank him for his continued service to our community. 
Other citizens should look to him as a role model, and I am proud to 
represent him in the United States Congress and to call him my friend.
