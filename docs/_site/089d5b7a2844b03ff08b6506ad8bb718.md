`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 9 July 2008`

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If the gentleman would yield, if you think about 
the amount of money that we have spent in Iraq, that we are going to go 
and fix the Middle East and make it different and the money that it 
costs, almost $1 trillion that we have spent there already and the 
projection of $3 trillion when you start talking about taking care of 
all the vets that are going to come back with traumatic brain injury, 
amputees. When you factor that cost in, Joe Stiglitz, the Nobel winning 
economist, says $3 trillion it's going to cost.

And I think it's important for the American people to realize that if 
we had made different decisions early on in this decade that those 
billions and billions and billions of dollars could have been invested 
into alternative energy sources, could have been invested into loan 
guarantees for nuclear plants, could have been invested in coal to 
liquid or whatever. Pick your issue.

I yield to my friend.
