`Mr. BUTTERFIELD â€” 12 February 2008`

---


Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to join my colleagues today 
in the consideration of H.R. 3532 which seeks to name a postal facility 
in Lula, Georgia, after Private Johnathon Millican, a distinguished and 
heroic American serviceman.

H.R. 3532, which was introduced by Representative Deal of Georgia, 
was introduced on September 14, 2007, and was considered and reported 
by the Oversight Committee on January 29, 2008, by a voice vote.

This measure has the support of the entire congressional delegation 
from the State of Georgia and provides us with yet another opportunity 
to pay tribute to a member of our country's armed service.

Johnathon Millican served his country proudly as a member of an 
airborne artillery brigade based out of Fort Richardson in Anchorage, 
Alaska, where I was a few weeks ago, and it is very cold out there, Mr. 
Speaker.

Private Millican gave his life in his service to our country when, on 
January 20, 2007, his unit was attacked by enemy insurgents in Karbala, 
Iraq. While Private Millican was only 20 years old when he lost his 
life in the line of duty, his service and faithful commitment to 
preserving the liberties and freedoms on which our Nation is built are 
sure to live on forever.

Mr. Speaker, let's remember and pay tribute to the ultimate sacrifice 
made by Private Millican. I urge the swift passage of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
