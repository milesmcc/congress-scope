Mr. BECERRA. Ladies and gentlemen, we would not send our troops into 
battle without the best training, armor or weapons. And in that same 
vein, in today's hypercompetitive global economy, we must know that our 
workers are the best trained, equipped with the best tools to challenge 
and excel in the face of that competition.

You name the time or the place, in a fair fight, give me an American 
worker at my side, and I know I'll come out okay.

But the tragedy here is that, just as we have learned that too many 
of our troops deployed to Iraq without sufficient body armor or vehicle 
protection and too many Iraq soldiers have come home to face deplorable 
or indifferent health care treatment as veterans, for years, too many 
Americans, as workers, have faced bureaucratic indifference and 
roadblocks in securing training and adjustment assistance after losing 
a job due to expanded trade. Today, we plan to change that.

H.R. 3920 doubles job training opportunities so no American worker 
will face getting in that line and finding out that when he or she gets 
up there the money's run out for training.

This bill also includes service employees and public employees in the 
protection, which we haven't had before. If you're a truck driver who 
loses a job because your company, that other company tells you, well, 
we no longer need your trucking services because that company's now 
moving to another country, you've lost your job because of trade, and 
you should be included as well. We make sure that that employer who has 
to begrudgingly tell that employee ''I have to let you go,'' that that 
employer can make sure that if it's a main customer that went abroad, 
you will be protected as an employee.

Mr. Speaker, this is a time for us to stand up for American workers. 
It's not their fault. They should be covered, just as our troops should 
be covered.
