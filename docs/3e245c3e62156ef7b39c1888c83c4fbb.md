# FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS

`Mrs. BACHMANN â€” 25 April 2007`

Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, my message this morning is very simple, 
and it is this. Our troops in combat deserve to be sent the resources 
and the reinforcements that they deserve to succeed in their mission in 
Iraq without strings and without delay.

Putting in place a time line that allows for no flexibility and that 
culminates with a date certain for withdrawal just simply micromanages 
our commanders in the field and, unfortunately, will undermine the 
effort of our troops on the ground.

Today, General Petraeus has offered to meet with Members of Congress 
concerning the war effort, and I look forward to meeting with the 
general. I hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will 
be there as well.

Can we remember that this war is truly about defeating terrorists, 
and that it is our effort to come together now, as Americans, to fight 
for freedom that will ultimately lead to our peace.
