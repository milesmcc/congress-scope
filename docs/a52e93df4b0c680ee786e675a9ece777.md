Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the 
Republic of Azerbaijan, a fast growing young democracy which secured 
its independence in 1991 after the dissolution of the former Soviet 
Union. There are few countries in the world which gain a second 
opportunity for independence, like Azerbaijan. This May 28 the Republic 
of Azerbaijan celebrates the 90th anniversary of Republic Day, the day 
the nation and people first gained their independence.

It was May 28, 1918 when Azerbaijan declared independence from the 
Russian Empire. The February 1917 fall of the tsarist monarchy in 
Russia had created favorable conditions for the development of national 
movements within its border lands. By establishing its independence, 
Azerbaijan, then the Democratic Azerbaijan Republic, became the first 
ever secular democratic republic in the world with a predominantly 
Muslim population. Although independence lasted only 2 years before 
Soviet forces invaded in 1920, the period was distinguished by nation 
building, the arts, education, and economic growth.

The Republic of Azerbaijan's re-independence in 1991 did not come 
easily. As independence fervor was sweeping through the former Soviet 
Republics in 1990, peaceful demonstrations were taking place throughout 
Azerbaijan. Tragically, on January 1990, then President Mikhail 
Gorbachev sent troops to Baku. Civilians were no match for the 
onslaught of tanks and fully armored military personnel. The excessive 
force resulted in more than one hundred and thirty civilian lives.

The Azerbaijani people eventually prevailed when the Soviet Union 
collapsed. On August 30, 1991, Azerbaijan's Parliament adopted the 
Declaration on the Restoration of the State of Independence of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan, and on October 18, 1991, the Constitution was 
approved.

Located in a highly political, dynamic and sensitive region between 
Russia and Iran, Azerbaijan is a confident member of the Council of 
Europe, United Nations, Organization of Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, and participates in NATO's Partnership for Peace program.

Azerbaijan is a strategic partner to the United States, and 
cooperates with the U.S., both bilaterally and multilaterally, (through 
the GUAM framework (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova) to 
prevent illegal trafficking and to secure borders Azerbaijani troops, 
like U.S. troops, are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan on behalf of 
their country and in support of the global effort against terrorism.

The United States recognized the sovereignty of Azerbaijan in 1918 
and again in 1991. I applaud their leadership as a democratic republic 
and strategic partner in the region and worldwide. Congratulations to 
all Azerbaijani citizens, and Azerbaijanis around the world, on the 
occasion of the 90th anniversary of Republic Day.
