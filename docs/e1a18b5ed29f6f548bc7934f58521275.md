Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to note that the rule and the 
process leading to its presentation are flawed and consequently, the 
underlying bill does not adequately serve our military forces or the 
taxpayers of this country.

Since 2002, billions of dollars have been given to the Pakistan 
military and much of that amount has not been accounted for.

Pakistani military commanders continue to consider certain extremists 
as their ''strategic assets'' in their seemingly never-ending security 
concerns involving fears about India; and the Pakistani military 
continues to fail to give proper attention to Pakistan's existential 
threat--the very extremists who associate with and harbor Al Qaeda and 
are also a threat to Afghanistan, our forces in Afghanistan, and others 
throughout the world.

I proposed, with a number of colleagues, and believe the bill must be 
improved by, an amendment establishing enforceable benchmarks on U.S. 
military assistance to Pakistan that would lead to the articulation of 
reasonable expectations.

Functionally, the amendment requires that the President make 
reasonable determinations about the state of mutual security objectives 
of Pakistan and the United States before any remainder of the military 
assistance for Pakistan can be obligated.

It does not seek to condition any civilian assistance to Pakistan. 
The American people and its government are the friends of Pakistan and 
its people, and we fully understand the crisis nature of the economy 
and civil governance status. The assistance in any measure should 
certainly be accounted for, and should be put to effect in such a way 
as to ensure it maximizes benefit to the Pakistani people. America is 
making a long term commitment to Pakistan, its democracy and its future 
prosperity.

Nevertheless, with respect to military funding, specifically, the 
amendment requires determinations on Pakistan--through its military--to 
make concerted progress toward:

(1) Ceasing of all support to groups presenting cross-border 
terrorist threats,

(2) Dismantling training facilities for such groups across Pakistan,

(3) Preventing and disrupting cross-border attacks,

(4) Strengthening and increasing counterterrorism prosecutions and 
extraditions,

(5) Degrading such groups' radio broadcast infrastructure, and

(6) Extending Pakistan's legitimate governmental writ across its 
territory and the protection of all its citizens' civil and human 
rights without discrimination.

As an oversight forcing function, the amendment requires written 
justification of the President's determinations and also tasks the U.S. 
Government Accountability Office with providing an independent analysis 
of the categories requiring Presidential determination.

Additionally, the amendment includes language allowing the President 
to waive the requirement if such action is certified to be vital to the 
national security interests of the United States. Finally, there is in 
the amendment a process for Congress to disprove of such certification 
if in its judgment such action is appropriate.

We must stop just handing out cash slush funds only to witness 
conduct not conducive to both nations' national security.

We have a right to expect that dangerous suspected terrorists will 
not just be set free as has reportedly happened with the Pakistani 
military's complicity; and a right to expect accountability for the 
hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars that should be targeted to 
effective security for our troops in Afghanistan and people here at 
home.

We must ensure resources are focused on Pakistan's and America's 
common security interests and the only really verifiable way to have 
that occur is to condition any funds sent to the Pakistani military in 
the way set forth in the proposed amendment.

For too long our military, and our government, have dealt directly 
with the Pakistani military and ignored the civilian government 
empowering their military to circumvent democratic accountability and 
hindering our ability to account for our investment. The way to resolve 
matters in Afghanistan relies heavily on circumstances in Pakistan. The 
situation in Pakistan cries out for accountability if we are to 
successfully protect our security.
