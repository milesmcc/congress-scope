Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, several days ago, Marine Lance Corporal 
Dean Opicka was killed in action while serving our Nation in Iraq. Dean 
was 29 years of age and is the third Luxemburg-Casco High School 
alumnus killed in Iraq.

David and Donna Opicka of Casco, Wisconsin, are the proud parents of 
Dean, who graduated from Luxemburg-Casco High School in 1997.

Dean joined the Marines in August of 2005 and graduated from boot 
camp at Camp Pendleton, California, in November. He was a brave member 
of the Milwaukee-based 2/24 Fox Company.

William Shakespeare, in his play, ''Julius Caesar,'' wrote, ''Cowards 
die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death 
but once.''

On behalf of every citizen in these United States I wish to express 
our sincerest gratitude to Marine Lance Corporal Dean Opicka. To his 
parents and family, this House of Representatives expresses our deepest 
regrets on his passing and thanks for his service.
