Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great privilege to 
be able to rise on the floor of the House today to challenge all of our 
colleagues to stand for our children. We are going to do it again, and 
that is to put on the floor of the House the Children's Health 
Insurance Program, $35 billion for 10 million children.

Forty days in Iraq will equal insuring 10 million children in giving 
them and providing uninsured low-income children with health care, 
insuring the lowest income children, pregnant women will be covered. 
Parents will not be covered. Mental health will be covered. 
Preventative care, saving the lives of our children, giving them the 
opportunity for a vigorous and prosperous future. Protecting our 
soldiers on the front lines when they can't pay for their children's 
health insurance. This has to be the road we take, the journey to help 
our children. Let us do it in a bipartisan manner, joining with two 
Houses, putting it on the desk of the President of the United States. 
What will this Nation do for her most precious resource? I hope we will 
pass the SCHIP bill together, united for all of our children.
