# FEDERAL FOOD DONATION ACT OF 2007

`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 17 December 2007`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the District of 
Columbia for yielding me the time and for her support for this bill and 
for so many other important issues.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4220, the Federal Food 
Donation Act of 2007.

Let me begin by commending the sponsor of this legislation, 
Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson. Congresswoman Emerson is a true champion 
for the hungry in this country. She's a friend who doesn't just talk 
about hunger, but is a leader in the effort to fight to end hunger in 
this country.

It's not an easy effort, and I know that she has to work to convince 
people around this country and in this very building that there are 
people who still go without food in this great Nation of ours. She's a 
shining example of someone who puts partisanship aside and works 
towards a goal that should be achievable.

So I want to thank Congresswoman Emerson for her steadfast leadership 
on this issue and for introducing this important legislation.

I also want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis and the 
other members of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for 
their quick and thorough work on this bill.

Mr. Speaker, hunger is getting worse in America. More than 35.5 
million people went hungry in the United States in 2006, an increase of 
more than 300,000 from 2005. There are many in Congress who talk about 
the booming economy and economic growth, but it is clear that millions 
of Americans are not benefiting from this so-called economic expansion.

The costs of living in America are rising. Energy costs are 
increasing, food prices continue to go up, and the housing crisis is 
straining the budgets of middle- and lower-income families. The reality 
is that many Americans are walking a fiscal tightrope where any 
economic change or family crisis, like an unexpected illness or job 
loss, could force people to go without food for a period of time.

That we are even talking about any person going hungry in the richest 
and most prosperous Nation in the world is an embarrassment, and we 
should all be ashamed for not doing more to combat hunger here at home.

H.R. 4220 is a good step in the fight against hunger. Unfortunately, 
it's not going to end hunger in America, but it will provide one more 
way to fight hunger.

As has already been described, the Federal Food Donation Act would 
require executive agencies who serve food on their premises to 
encourage the donation of excess food to nonprofit organizations. Such 
food rescue efforts can be particularly useful to the more than 43,000 
soup kitchens and food pantries on the front lines battling hunger. The 
Oversight and Government Reform Committee broadened the scope of this 
bill, and I'm especially pleased the bill was expanded to include the 
Department of Defense.

The reality is that food costs are increasing; and America's food 
banks, the safety net of our anti-hunger system, is straining to meet 
this need. According to a new report released today by the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors, requests for food increased an average of 12 
percent over the last year. Yet at the same time, a recent Washington 
Post article reports that the Capital Area Food Bank, the emergency 
food system for Washington, DC, had only 230,000 pounds of food on its 
shelves, down from 570,000 pounds at this time last year. Nationwide, 
food donations to food banks are expected to fall short of the need by 
15 million pounds.

Mr. Speaker, we need to do more to address and ultimately end hunger 
in America. The Federal safety net developed over the years, the Food 
Stamp program, Meals on Wheels, school meals and the emergency food 
system, is working but it is strained. Private organizations like 
Catholic Charities and the Nation's food banks, just to name two 
examples, are filling the gaps where they can. It is time we commit to 
ending hunger once and for all. It's time that we dedicate the 
resources of our great Nation to ending this scourge. The Federal Food 
Donation Act is a good first step, and I'm pleased that the House is 
acting on it today.

Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record at this point two articles 
documenting the shortage of food for the hungry in this country and one 
article announcing the U.S. Conference of Mayors report on hunger and 
homelessness.

 Blessed Is the Full Plate














 (By Anna Quindlen)




 One of the most majestic dining rooms in New York City is 


 in the Church of the Holy Apostles. After the landmark 


 building was nearly destroyed by fire in 1990, the Episcopal 


 parish made the decision not to replace the pews so that the 


 nave could become a place of various uses. There are 


 traditional Sunday services, of course, and the gay and 


 lesbian synagogue on Friday evenings. And every weekday more 


 than a thousand people eat lunch at round tables beneath 12-


 foot stained-glass windows and a priceless Dutch pipe organ.



 ''You can't get more Biblical than feeding the hungry:' 


 says the Rev. William Greenlaw, the rector.



 Holy Apostles has fed the hungry for 25 years now without 


 missing a single weekday, including the morning after the 


 fire, when the church lay in ruins, still smoldering, and 943 


 meals were served by candlelight. There's a queue on Ninth 


 Avenue by midmorning;




 sometimes tourists think there's a wait for some exclusive 


 New York happening until they notice the shabby clothes, 


 piles of shopping bags and unshaven faces that are the small 


 unmistakable markers of poverty.



 The poor could be forgiven for feeling somewhat poorer 


 nowadays. The share of the nation's income going to the top 1 


 percent of its citizens is at its highest level since 1928, 


 just before the big boom went bust. But poverty is not a 


 subject that's been discussed much by the current 


 administration, who were wild to bring freedom to the Iraqis 


 but not bread to the South Bronx. ''Hunger is hard for us as 


 a nation to admit,'' says Clyde Kuemmerle, who oversees the 


 volunteers at Holy Apostles. ''That makes it hard to talk 


 about and impossible to run on.''



 At Holy Apostles the issue is measured in mouthfuls. Pasta, 


 collard greens, bread, cling peaches. But in this anniversary 


 year the storage shelves are less full, the pipeline less 


 predictable. The worst emergency food shortage in years is 


 plaguing charities from Maine to California, even while the 


 number of those who need help grows. The director of City 


 Harvest in New York, Jilly Stephens, has told her staff they 


 have to find another million pounds of food over the next few 


 months to make up the shortfall. ''Half as many pantry bags'' 


 is the mantra heard now that the city receives half the 


 amount of emergency food than it once did from the Feds. In 


 Los Angeles 24 million pounds of food in 2002 became 15 


 million in 2006; in Oregon 13 million pounds dwindled to six. 


 It's a cockamamie new math that denies the reality of hunger 


 amid affluence.



 There are many reasons why. An agriculture bill that would 


 have increased aid and the food-stamp allotment has been 


 knocking around Congress, where no one ever goes hungry. 


 Donations from a federal program that buys excess crops from 


 farmers and gives them to food banks has shrunk alarmingly. 


 Even the environment and corporate efficiency have 


 contributed to empty pantries: more farmers are producing 


 corn for ethanol, and more companies have conquered quality 


 control, cutting down on those irregular cans and battered 


 boxes that once went to the needy.



 What hasn't shrunk is the size of the human stomach. At 


 lunchtime at Holy Apostles, Ernest is hungry, his hand 


 bandaged because he got in a fight, even though he is sober 


 now and has his own place in the Bronx. Janice is hungry, 


 too, she of the beautiful manners and carefully knotted 


 headscarf, who sleeps on the train on winter nights and walks 


 with a cane since being hit by a car. There are the two 


 veterans, both Marines, with the raddled faces and slightly 


 unfocused eyes of those who sleep outdoors, which means 


 mostly always being half-awake, and that group of Chinese 


 women who don't speak English, and the Muslim couple who sit 


 alone. Mostly it's single men at Holy Apostles. Some are 


 mentally ill, and some are addicts, and to repair their lives 


 would take a lot of help. But at the moment they have an 


 immediate problem with an immediate answer: pasta, collard 


 greens, bread, cling peaches.



 This place is a blessing, and an outrage. ''We call these 


 people our guests,'' says the rector. ''They are the children 


 of God.'' That's real God talk. The political arena has been 


 lousy with the talk-show variety in recent years: worrying 


 about whether children could pray in school instead of 


 whether they'd eaten before they got there, obsessing about 


 the beginning of life instead of the end of poverty, 


 concerned with private behavior instead of public generosity.



 There's a miracle in which an enormous crowd comes to hear 


 Jesus and he feeds them all by turning a bit of bread and 


 fish into enough to serve the multitudes. The truth is that 


 America is so rich that political leaders could actually 


 produce some variant of that miracle if they had the will. 


 And, I suppose, if they thought there were votes in it. 


 Enough with the pious sanctimony about gay marriage and 


 abortion. If elected officials want to bring God talk into 


 public life, let it be the bedrock stuff, about charity and 


 mercy and the least of our brethren. Instead of the 


 performance art of the presidential debate, the candidates 


 should come to Holy Apostles and do what good people, people 


 of faith, do there every day--feed the hungry, comfort the 


 weary, soothe the afflicted. And wipe down the tables after 


 each seating. Here's a prayer for every politician: pasta, 


 collard greens, bread, cling peaches. Amen.
