Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, a number of Vermont families are 
traveling to Arlington National Cemetery this week. They are a special 
group and they are here for a very special reason. The group is called 
The Vermont Fallen. They represent the many families in our State who 
have lost a loved one during the war in Afghanistan or the war in Iraq.

On Saturday, July 14, The Vermont Fallen will come together to 
support Marion and Peter Dooley for the internment of LT Mark Dooley's 
ashes at Arlington National Cemetery.

A fellow Vermonter, Lieutenant Dooley was born July 15, 1978. He was 
a graduate of the 2001 class of Norwich University and served as a 
police officer in Wilmington, VT, as well as the Windham County 
Sheriff's Department. A first lieutenant in the Vermont National Guard, 
he served with the 3rd Battalion, 172d Mountain Infantry. He was killed 
west of Ramadi, Iraq, on September 19, 2005, when the scout platoon he 
was leading was ambushed.

The Vermont Fallen serves a wonderful and unique purpose. They allow 
families from Vermont who have suffered unimaginable loss to come 
together and support each other in a way that only they themselves can 
do.

Today, we honor the life and the loss of LT Mark H. Dooley. In doing 
so, we also honor the lives of all those brave Vermont soldiers who 
never came home.
