`Mr. AKAKA â€” 7 February 2007`

---


Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, earlier this week the Senate had an 
opportunity to begin debate on Iraq and the current plan proposed by 
President Bush. While I and 48 of my colleagues supported moving 
forward with this important debate, others in this Chamber elected to 
prevent discussion on an issue of national importance.

I understand that there are doubts as to what is the proper course of 
action to pursue in Iraq. We all wish for victory. We all wish for an 
end to the death and destruction. None of us want to waste additional 
lives in futile missions, or futile gestures. We all wish for a stable, 
democratic Iraq--and I would add to that Afghanistan, as this conflict 
is being waged on more than one front. We all share those common 
desires and none of us, none of us can predict the future. But what we 
can do is to apply our wisdom and judgement as to what is the best 
course of action for the United States to take. That task is our solemn 
duty.

We cannot perform that duty with all the honesty and clarity that 
this great body--the United States Senate--is known for if we cannot 
begin debate. Denying an open discussion of the issues of grave 
importance to our national security does not serve our Nation well.

We are at a great turning point and the consequences of this policy 
must be debated. Future generations will be affected by the course of 
action our Nation takes in the Middle East. No one can say with 
certainty which path will lead us toward light and which could lead us 
toward a darker future. But these courses of action demand debate.

Right now our Nation's wealth is being poured into a growing 
maelstrom in the Middle East--a storm that is engulfing the lives of 
our most talented soldiers, a storm that is exhausting our national 
treasure and sinking us deeper into a debt that our grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren will be paying off. It means our Nation's 
education, environment, health, and transportation


systems are eroding for a lack of basic resources.

Again, the consequences of this policy must be debated. In Iraq, 
there is a clear choice: support the President's policy of full steam 
ahead and continue the current policy of putting American soldiers in 
harm's way or shift strategy and make it clear that it is time for the 
Iraqi government to govern and Iraqi troops to protect the Iraqi 
people.

In any case, whatever policy advocated--whether one supports staying 
in, getting out now, or getting out later--those choices deserve to be 
fully and completely debated and voted on in the United States Senate.

I urge my colleagues on the other side to support a full and open 
debate on the President's Iraq policy.

Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a 
quorum.
