Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Michael 
Yarbrough of Glen Rose, Arkansas, who died on September 6, 2007, 
fighting for our country in Iraq while supporting Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. He was 24 years old when he selflessly gave his life for his 
country during combat operations.

Sergeant Yarbrough's deep sense of unity and teamwork led him to 
honorably serve his country as a United States Marine. Having completed 
2 tours of duty, Sergeant Yarbrough volunteered to return to Iraq in 
place of a soldier whose wife was pregnant. This gesture of 
selflessness encapsulated the spirit of this young man as he was always 
thinking of others before himself.

Sergeant Yarbrough joined the Marines in January of 2002, and his 
proud service will continue to live on and serve as an inspiration to 
the many soldiers who knew him and fought alongside him in combat. He 
was a Marine in the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 1st Marine 
Division, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. His bravery and courage as a 
Marine was exemplified by his numerous awards and military decorations, 
including the Purple Heart Medal.

Sergeant Michael Yarbrough gave his life to serve our country and he 
will forever be remembered as a hero, a husband, a son and a friend. My 
deepest condolences go out to his wife Mary Ann Yarbrough; his mother, 
Rhonda Kidder and his father Jerry Yarbrough; his 2 sisters Misty 
Hutcheson and Christy Smith; and to his numerous aunts, uncles, nieces 
and nephews. He will be missed by his family, his community, his 
country and all those who knew him. On this 17th day of September, 
which would have been Sergeant Yarbrough's 25th birthday, I honor him 
for his service and will continue to keep his family in my deepest 
thoughts and prayers.
