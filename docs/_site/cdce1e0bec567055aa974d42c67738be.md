`Mr. LOTT â€” 24 April 2007`

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my pleasure be here to speak on behalf 
of the confirmation of Halil Suleyman Ozerden to serve on the U.S. 
District


Court for south Mississippi. I am truly pleased that the President has 
nominated this outstanding young attorney to this position in 
Mississippi. I thank the Judiciary Committee for the expeditious 
handling of the nomination. I particularly thank the chairman, the 
Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the ranking member, Senator 
Specter, for moving the nomination forward.

I made it a particular point of pronouncing his name and trying to 
get it correct because this is a very highly qualified nominee but an 
unusual one. I believe he will probably be the only Turkish American to 
serve on the Federal judiciary anywhere in America. We didn't select 
him because of that, but it is a fact. He has an outstanding record, 
and he will be an outstanding member of the judiciary.

Long before I knew this young man, I met his father. Sul is the son 
of a Gulfport, MS, doctor, psychiatrist, a Turkish immigrant, and 
naturalized U.S. citizen. He was truly a well respected citizen in the 
community as well as a doctor.

I met him back when I was in the House of Representatives, years ago, 
in the 1970s, as a matter of fact. His father came to visit my office 
on the Mississippi gulf coast one day to thank me for a controversial 
vote I had cast, one that was particularly unpopular with a lot of my 
constituents. Well, now, House Members are not used to people actually 
coming to their office and thanking them for casting a vote a lot of 
people disagree with, so I took a particular liking to this doctor, and 
I stayed in touch with him and his family over these past 30 years.

But I was particularly impressed, as I watched the doctor's son grow 
up and achieve such a tremendous record.

I began hearing about Sul, his professional accomplishments, and the 
impact that he was having on the gulf coast community. Now one of the 
most respected young lawyers in Mississippi, Sul may soon have the rare 
opportunity to serve both his community and his country as a Federal 
judge.

During my time in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to deal with 
countless judicial nominees. Seldom have I seen a nominee who comes as 
highly recommended--and who is as highly credentialed--as Sul Ozerden.

This young man graduated from what was then a very large high school 
in Mississippi, Gulfport High School, in 1985. He was salutatorian in 
his class. He then attended Georgetown University's School of Foreign 
Service on a Navy ROTC scholarship, graduating magna cum laude and Phi 
Beta Kappa in 1989.

Following graduation, he served 6 years active duty as a commissioned 
officer and naval flight officer in the U.S. Navy, where he achieved 
the rank of lieutenant as an A-6E Intruder bombardier/navigator. He was 
awarded the Navy Commendation Medal for missions flown over Iraq during 
Operation Southern Watch and Somalia during Operation Restore Hope.

After his military service, he earned his law degree from Stanford 
Law School, where he served as associate editor for the Stanford Law 
Review. Following law school, he clerked for the Honorable Eldon 
Fallon, U.S. district court judge in New Orleans, before returning home 
to enter the private practice of law in Gulfport.

That is an incredible record, outstanding record--in high school, in 
college, in the military, and law school, and he served as a clerk to a 
Federal judge. He has all the credentials that will qualify him for 
this position.

He then returned to the gulf coast as a shareholder in one of the 
gulf coast's most respected firms, Dukes, Dukes, Keating & Faneca, 
where his practice has focused on general civil defense litigation, 
representation of local law enforcement and governmental entities, and 
commercial transactions and litigation.

In addition to his professional accomplishments, Sul is also involved 
in his community, as his father was. He has served as a mentor in the 
Gulfport Public School District. He has been named ''Volunteer of the 
Year'' by the Gulfport Chamber of Commerce, an area where we have had a 
lot of voluntarism in the last 2 years to help people and help our 
communities recover from Hurricane Katrina. He served on the board of 
directors--and as president--of the Gulfport Chamber of Commerce. He 
also served as the president of the Gulfport Business Club. He was also 
named as one of the Sun Herald newspaper's ''Top 10 Business Leaders 
Under 40'' for the southern part of the State of Mississippi.

He is active in his church, St. Peter's By-the-Sea Episcopal Church, 
where he is on the church's building committee--an extremely important 
position within a church seeking to rebuild from devastation caused by 
Hurricane Katrina.

President Bush has nominated one of south Mississippi's finest to 
fill one of Mississippi's most important positions. Sul's academic 
credentials, brilliant mind, analytical ability, legal skills, world 
experiences and common sense are rare qualities in one person. The 
Federal judiciary is lucky to have the opportunity to secure the 
services of Sul Ozerden, and I look forward to his confirmation.

Mr. President, I do not know when I have supported a nominee to be a 
Federal judge in Mississippi more than I do this one. I am very proud 
of this nomination, and he will surely be overwhelmingly confirmed in a 
few minutes. Sul Ozerden, of Gulfport, MS, will be a credit to his 
parents, the community, and to the Federal judiciary.

I yield the floor.
