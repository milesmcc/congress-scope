Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, congratulations to our 
troops for capturing the highest ranking Iraqi in al Qaeda's 
leadership. Mashhadani, known to be the most senior Iraqi in al Qaeda 
leadership, operated as chief communicator between his terrorists and 
senior al Qaeda leaders, including bin Laden and Zawahiri.

This arrest further confirms the connection between al Qaeda and Iraq 
and


the global terrorism network. I believe this news is significant in 
proving that the al Qaeda our troops are fighting in Iraq is 
inseparable in the front on the global war on terrorism.

Our troops are fighting to protect American families. Stopping the 
terrorists in Iraq, which Zawahiri and bin Laden have identified as the 
central front in the global war on terrorism, is vital to this effort. 
Our troops' courageous efforts in Iraq are working, and we must support 
our brave men and women in uniform to defeat this enemy who promotes 
mass murder.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th.
