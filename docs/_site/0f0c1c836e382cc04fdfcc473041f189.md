Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate one of Utah's 
fallen sons, SFC Rocky H. Herrera of Salt Lake City, UT. Sergeant 
Herrera was a member of the 585th Pipeline Company, 864th Engineer 
Combat Battalion. On August 28, 2007, he lost his life through injuries 
received from the detonation of an improvised explosive device.

Sergeant Herrera's last act was a measure full of the love and 
devotion he had for his fellow soldiers. Sergeant Herrera's battalion 
was building a bridge when a suicide bomber drove a vehicle carrying an 
explosive device headed toward them. I have been reliably informed that 
just prior to the explosion Sergeant Herrera placed his body between 
the vehicle and his men to protect the lives of his beloved soldiers.

In addition to this act of bravery, Sergeant Herrera has always 
dedicated his life to the preservation of freedom. In 1986, Sergeant 
Herrera joined the Army Reserve and served as a crane operator. A 
decade later he proudly joined the full time force.

In addition to the two tours he served in Iraq, he was also deployed 
to Bosnia, South Korea, and Honduras. In each assignment he excelled 
and was accordingly promoted to such vital assignments as a squad 
leader and a drill instructor.

Recently, Sergeant Herrera's life was blessed by the birth of his 
granddaughter Kylie. The sergeant has left behind his wife Traci, as 
well as two daughters and two sons. One of Sergeant Herrera's sons, 
Matt, remembers his dad always spent as much time with the family as he 
could.

I will pray for Sergeant Herrera's family and remember their 
sacrifice of their husband, father, and grandfather.
