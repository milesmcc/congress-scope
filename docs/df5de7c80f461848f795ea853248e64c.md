# MORE DELAYS ON TROOP FUNDING

`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 14 July 2010`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, before Congress adjourned 
for the July 4th recess, I stood at this spot with a plea to Democratic 
leadership to do the right thing and bring the military supplemental 
bill forward as a clean bill for quick passage. My request and those of 
many of my colleagues went unanswered. The result? Our troops at risk 
do not have the funding they need. It is a shame that Congress could 
not get this troop funding bill passed before the Pentagon's deadline. 
By not passing or debating a budget--another travesty--Congress 
certainly has had plenty of time to get this done.

As a veteran myself, with four sons currently serving in the 
military, I know we have brave men and women in uniform around the 
world who shouldn't have to worry about Congress' failure to fund their 
programs and missions. We have counterinsurgency operations right now 
in Iraq and Afghanistan that should not be interrupted or held up by 
lawmakers so they can add billions of additional dollars in unrelated 
pet projects.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
