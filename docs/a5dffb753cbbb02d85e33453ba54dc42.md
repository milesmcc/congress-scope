Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as we begin to commemorate and 
celebrate the founding of this Nation, what a great Nation, July 4 
brings all Americans together. We stand strong. We are bold and we are 
proud. I am proud to be an American.

But I petition this government, this Congress, this President that we 
must resolve the Iraq crisis. Our soldiers are defined as they are, 
warriors for justice. But when you have a complete collapse of 
government, as was evidenced in the last 24 hours, suicide bombs, car 
bombs, an enormous toil and toll of lives being taken, our soldiers 
emerged in neighborhoods, sitting as sitting ducks, it is time to bring 
our troops home. And as long as we remain tone deaf to the American 
people, we undermine the values of this Nation that indicates we all 
are created equal.

It is time to bring our troops home from Iraq. It is time for a new 
policy and a new direction.
