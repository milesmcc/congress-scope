Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues 
from the Ways and Means Committee for including provisions from H.R. 
337 and H.R. 551 in the HEART Act. These are two important bills that I 
have been championing since I came to Congress.

The first bill addresses a glitch in the SSI program. Because 
eligibility for SSI benefits is based on a family's income, military 
families lose benefits when additional pay is added to their income. A 
military family struggling to make ends meet loses benefits for their 
children if they receive jump pay, hazardous duty pay or a number of 
other pays considered ''unearned income.'' I think I speak for my 
colleagues when I say these pays are not unearned but hard earned.

The second bill addresses qualified veterans mortgage bonds. And as a 
Californian, I join with other colleagues in the desire to provide 
veterans who signed up for service after 1977 with a better opportunity 
to achieve homeownership. Why should a veteran who served in Iraq be 
treated any differently than somebody who signed up before 1977? 
Correcting this flaw in current law will allow those returning from 
Iraq and Afghanistan to have


great opportunities towards owning a home in California's high-cost 
real estate market.
