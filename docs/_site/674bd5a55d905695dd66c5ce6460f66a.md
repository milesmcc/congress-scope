Mr. CLYBURN. Let me thank our chairman for yielding me this time.

To date, we have spent almost half a trillion dollars on the Iraq 
war. Over 3,600 American lives have been lost, and more than 26,000 
Americans have been wounded. When the President announced his 
escalation plan 6 months ago, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said it 
would only last a few months. Majority Leader Boehner said we would 
know whether or not the escalation succeeded or failed within 90 days. 
And Secretary Rice said we would not stay married to a plan that is not 
working.

Since the President announced this surge, we have lost nearly 600 
American troops and spent more than $60 billion. In fact, the monthly 
cost in lives and resources has increased dramatically since the war 
began.

Today, the American people received an interim report from the 
President on his escalation plan. This was the verdict: None of the 18 
benchmarks he outlined in January have been reached. In fact, it 
clearly illustrated how far the Iraqi Government is from political 
progress and national reconciliation.

A recently released national intelligence report concludes that al 
Qaeda has reconstituted its core network and may be a stronger 
terrorist organization than it was a year ago. In fact, it could be 
closer to pre-9/11 strength and reach.

Republicans have spoken out against this war, failed policies in Iraq 
yet, out of fear of being called names, are reluctant to vote against 
this resolution.

What have we come to when if people express their consciences, they 
are called names? It's beneath the dignity of the sacrifices of our men 
and women, and I ask my colleagues to vote for this resolution.
