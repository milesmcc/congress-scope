Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, with all the huffing and puffing, I am glad the minority 
ranking member supports the bill. Let me remind people what this bill 
is all about. It is about our veterans. It is about our veterans.

A DOD study after Vietnam found in fact that 15 percent of veterans 
with severe traumatic brain injury, TBI, developed epilepsy soon after 
their injury. We know how many TBI victims we have from Iraq and 
Afghanistan. So as more and more veterans move from DOD health care to 
the VA health care system, the VA must be prepared to treat TBI and 
epilepsy.

The Epilepsy Centers of Excellence in this bill by Mr. Perlmutter of 
Colorado would function as centers of research on the diagnosis, 
treatment and long-term effects of epilepsy. It gives the VA the tools 
to provide to veterans with epilepsy the quality of care that they 
deserve.

I join my ranking member in urging my colleagues to support H.R. 
2818, as amended.
