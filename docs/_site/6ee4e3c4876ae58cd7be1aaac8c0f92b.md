# TO REVISE UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `6ee4e3c4876ae58cd7be1aaac8c0f92b`
`Mr. SPECTER â€” 14 March 2007`

---


Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate has now commenced the debate 
on an issue of great importance, really of historic importance, which 
challenges us on the issue of what course of action we should take in 
Iraq, in a very complex factual situation, and challenges us on what 
our authority is under the Constitution, contrasted


with the President's authority as Commander in Chief.

On the factual issue, when we look at the resolution, which calls for 
the phased redeployment of the U.S. forces from Iraq not later than 120 
days after enactment of this joint resolution, with the goal of 
deploying by March 31, 2008, all U.S. combat forces, except for three 
purposes: one, to protect the U.S. and coalition personnel and 
infrastructure; second, training and equipping Iraqi forces; third, 
conducting targeted counterterrorism operations.

We are setting a deadline and our opponents simply have to wait us 
out. They know if they can hold on until March 31, 2008, a little more 
than a year from now, we will be leaving, except for those stated 
limited purposes. That is not a very desirable course of conduct.

It is equally undesirable, however, to view the current situation in 
Iraq, which looks like an endless tunnel--a tunnel without a light at 
the end. You cannot see the end of the tunnel and, certainly, there is 
no light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what we can do.

Last month, the House of Representatives passed a nonbinding 
resolution expressing displeasure, objecting to the President's course 
of action in Iraq. Last November, in the election, the American people 
spoke in a resounding manner, in a way that could only rationally be 
interpreted as rejecting the conduct of the war in Iraq. We are faced 
with very considerable discomfort in this body. How it will resolve 
itself remains to be seen. I think it is very important that we debate 
this matter, that we exchange our views, that we stimulate discussions 
that will go beyond this Chamber and will resound throughout the 
country, resound throughout the editorial pages and the television and 
radio talk shows, and by our colleagues in the corridors and in the 
cloakroom so that we can try to work our way through an extraordinarily 
difficult situation where, as I see it, there is no good answer between 
the two intractable alternatives to set a timetable where our opponents 
simply have to wait us out or to keep proceeding down a tunnel which, 
at least at this juncture, appears to be endless and has no light. We 
don't know where the end is, let alone to have a light at the end of 
the tunnel.


What I am trying to do at the moment is to get from the 
administration, from the Department of Defense, and the Department of 
State an evaluation of what has happened since General Petraeus briefed 
us on what he intended to do before he returned to Iraq several weeks 
ago. There have been some preliminary reports that the strategy 
employed by General Petraeus is producing results. There have been some 
commentaries.

The Washington Post last Sunday in an op-ed suggested things are 
improving. Reports by NBC's Brian Williams suggest that matters are 
improving, not sufficiently definitive to come to any conclusion, but 
if there was a sign on the military side that we could see improvement 
and see a path to victory, that would have a material bearing on what 
this body would do or at least on the thinking of this Senator.

The resolution calls for a comprehensive strategy, and it defines it 
as ''diplomatic, political, and economic strategy that includes 
sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors and the international 
community for the purpose of working collectively to bring stability to 
Iraq.''

I was pleased to hear the testimony of Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice, when she appeared before the Appropriations Committee on which I 
sit on February 27, 2007, announcing the initiative of an international 
conference to be held in Baghdad and announcing for the first time that 
there would be negotiations by the United States in a conference which 
included Iran and Syria, which I think is a very important and sensible 
change in the foreign policy of the United States.

We saw the results in North Korea where we faced a very difficult 
situation with North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and the various 
tests they had undertaken. We saw the multilateral discussions and 
then, more importantly, saw bilateral talks between the United States 
and North Korea, which Secretary of State Rice obtained the authority 
of the President to engage in those direct bilateral talks so when she 
was traveling overseas, she did not go through the normal vetting and 
analytical processes in Washington which might well have stopped that 
direct bilateral discussion. It did occur, and it appears to have been 
instrumental in working out what may well be a diplomatic answer. It 
appears that way at the present time, although no one can ever be sure 
in dealing with North Korea.

I would like to have an up-to-date evaluation--and I am seeking one--
from the Department of State as to what is happening with those 
negotiations. Candidly, it is pretty hard when we have one of our 
sessions in room 407 upstairs, which is the secret room where we are 
briefed. We very seldom get much information there. I think it would be 
very useful if we could find information to bring us up to date as to 
what progress, if any, the administration is making. I know, to repeat, 
it would be very influential on my thinking as to what course I will 
take when the roll is called on these resolutions.

Beyond the evaluation of the factual situation, there are very 
complex legal questions involved in what is the authority of Congress. 
The resolution does not call upon the congressional constitutional 
authority on appropriations or the so-called power of the purse. We 
know there is authority in the Congress to cut off funding. I think 
there is unanimous agreement that we should not even broach the issue 
cutting off funding if in any way it would jeopardize the troops who 
are serving in Iraq.

The President's powers as Commander in Chief have been the subject of 
judicial interpretation. In the case of Fleming v. Page--it goes back a 
long way to 1850--but the Supreme Court said:




 As commander-in-chief, he is authorized to direct the 


 movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at 


 his command, and to employ them in the manner he may deem 


 most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy.


On the face of that statement by the Nation's highest Court, there is 
a real question as to whether Congress has the constitutional authority 
to order the ''phased redeployment of the United States forces from 
Iraq.''

The Supreme Court dealt with the issue on the power of the purse in 
the case of United States v. Lovett in 1946, holding that Congress 
cannot use its appropriations power indirectly to accomplish an 
unconstitutional objective.

So that brings into play squarely what is the constitutional 
authority of the President as Commander in Chief.

I think it is most unwise for Congress to even broach the subject of 
micromanagement of the war. When Congressman Murtha suggested some time 
ago that funding be conditioned on a whole series of requirements, it 
bore all the earmarks of micromanagement of the war.

The resolution at hand calling for a redeployment may well cross that 
line of micromanagement of the war. It is unclear. But there remains 
the very deep concern in the country, expressed by the electorate last 
November, expressed by citizens across the country that reflected in 
the resolution passed by the House of Representatives last month 
objecting to the administration's conduct of the war and considerable 
sentiment in this body so that we are searching for a way to approach 
this issue rationally.

We have to face up to the consequence that if we acknowledge defeat 
in Iraq, there are very disastrous consequences which will flow from 
that, disastrous consequences in the region, the issue of whether the 
terrorists will come at least in part from the Mideast to threaten us 
on the homeland. But, at the same time, we have to recognize that when 
the President laid down two markers in his State of the Union speech 
earlier this year, that the Iraqis accomplish two objectives: One, to 
stabilize Baghdad, and, two, to end sectarian violence. The Iraqis have 
not shown either the capacity or the will to accomplish those two 
prerequisites which the President set down as minimal markers.

My thinking is we ought to deliberate on this subject. We ought to 
hear each other out, and we ought to seek updated information from the 
administration to see whether there are any signs, in the several weeks 
since General Petraeus has undertaken the new


strategy, whether there are any indications of what may lie ahead on 
the negotiations, now that there have been contacts by the United 
States with Iranian officials and presumably also with Syrian 
officials.

I would like to see this Chamber filled with Senators when we 
undertake this debate. I recollect the debate we had back in 1991, 
which was classified as historic, when we decided to pass a resolution 
authorizing the use of force. I know we are all very busy. I am about 
to go to a hearing of a subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, 
and Education. This issue warrants the close attention of the Senate. 
We have been called the world's greatest deliberative body, and this 
issue now will give us a chance to see if we are entitled to that lofty 
title.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I sent to the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, outlining underlying legal issues 
in the debate we are now undertaking, be printed in the Record.
