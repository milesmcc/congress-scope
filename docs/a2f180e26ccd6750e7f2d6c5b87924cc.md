Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of our 
committee and also the distinguished senior member, senior ranking 
member of our committee, the gentleman from Alaska, for their 
bipartisan support of this legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 65, the proposed 
legislation to federally recognize the Lumbee Indian tribe of North 
Carolina. I commend my good friends and colleagues from North Carolina, 
especially my good friend, Mr. McIntyre, for his perseverance, his 
leadership and his determination to provide this long-overdue Federal 
recognition to the Lumbee Tribe. This is a bipartisanship bill. This is 
not a Republican or a Democratic bill.

Specifically, H.R. 65 extends Federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe 
and specifies that tribal members will be eligible for Federal 
benefits. The bill expressly prohibits the Lumbee Tribe from conducting 
gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or any Federal law. The 
bill also provides the State of North Carolina with jurisdiction over 
all civil and criminal matters on land owned by or held in trust for 
the Lumbee Tribe.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation is long overdue. The existence of the 
Lumbee Tribe as a distinct Indian community is beyond question. They 
are descended from the Cheraw and related tribes in North Carolina, and 
they have lived along the Lumber River since the first white settlers 
lived in the area. Even today, the tribal members live in a tightly 
knit community, mostly in Robeson County, North Carolina. Lumbees have 
been recognized by the State of North Carolina since 1885, and the 
tribe has been seeking Federal recognition for nearly 120 years.

This legislation is necessary to remedy the inequity created by this 
very institution. The Congress of the United States of America passed a 
law in 1956 which federally recognized the Lumbee Tribe but at the same 
time prohibited the application of Federal programs available like it 
has done for other American Indian tribes. This act has been 
interpreted in the courts as conveying Federal recognition and 
termination of the tribe at the same time but has prevented the 
Department of Interior from providing Federal recognition to the Lumbee 
Tribe through the administrative process. As a result, the only 
recourse available for this tribe is to seek relief from the Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I need not remind my colleagues that the authority to 
deal with all matters affecting the welfare and needs of the first 
Americans or American Indians is expressly stated under provisions of 
clause 3, section 8, article 1 of the Constitution of the United 
States.

I want to share with my colleagues some questions, perhaps, that may 
have been raised concerning the proposed legislation.

''Question: Is this the first time the Lumbee Tribe has sought 
Federal recognition?

''Answer: No. This tribe first sought Federal recognition through a 
petition submitted to Congress in 1899 and in 1956. Congress formally 
recognized the Lumbee Tribe. However, it effectively terminated its 
relationship with the tribe at the same time by denying them access to 
the benefits and privileges that accompany Federal recognition. Since 
that time, the tribe has had substantial interaction with the Congress. 
The tribe has also petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs for 
recognition through its administrative process. The Bureau denied this 
petition, indicating that the tribe is not eligible for the process 
because of Congress' prior action.

''Question: Why is the tribe not going through the administrative 
process,'' as it was argued earlier by some of our colleagues?



''Answer: The administrative process is for those groups where it 
needs to be determined whether or not the group is an Indian tribe.''

I submit to my colleagues, we have not done a very good job in 
dealing with the first Americans, and I sincerely hope that this 
proposed legislation will rectify the situation that this tribe has 
been seeking for over 100 years.

I want to share this proposed bill, which will provide us with an 
opportunity to address this long-standing injustice that has been done 
to the Lumbee Indians. I support the Lumbee recognition bill because I 
believe it is consistent with our responsibility as Members of this 
great institution to give the members of the Lumbee Tribe their right 
to be recognized as truly an American Indian tribe.

Let's correct this inequity that has existed now for over 100 years 
and as a tribute to the six Lumbee Indian soldiers who died recently in 
the war in Iraq, for which they made the ultimate sacrifice and have 
given their lives in defense of our Nation. After 100 years, these 
people have been tortured enough.

I am reminded of the words echoed by a retired Marine general and 
former colleague from this body, the former gentleman from Guam, 
Congressman Ben Blaz, a good Republican and a very dear friend of mine. 
He said, also, this is a statement this gentleman made, his observation 
also of the unfair treatment of his people in some past history, and 
this is about sending all the tribes that we have here in America and I 
know are great warriors, because that's the inherent character of the 
first Americans. They are warriors.

This is what Congressman Ben Blaz says. ''We are equal in war, but 
not in peace.''

Give the Lumbee Indians what they deserve, recognition as they should 
get from this great institution.
