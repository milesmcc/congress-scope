# LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT

Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I will vote against H.R. 65, the Lumbee 
Recognition Act.

This was a very difficult decision. I have only had to vote on a few 
issues that have caused me so much difficulty. One being my vote 
against the war in Iraq. The same difficulty is here today.

Today's votes will decide the future for the Lumbee tribe.

However, H.R. 65 determines the future of many more individuals, such 
as the entire Native American Community and our Nation as a whole.

There is too much information arguing both for and against giving 
Federal recognition through the legislative process to this tribe.

As a Hispanic, I understand what it is like to have to fight for 
equality.

As an American, I treasure and understand the importance of 
sovereignty, of liberty, independence, autonomy and freedom.

I believe that the best method to decide whether to develop a new 
sovereign relationship is to have the Lumbee directly apply to the BIA. 
The Lumbee tribe should apply for recognition via the administrative 
process and I support allowing this to occur.

My vote today will follow that decision because of the many questions 
regarding their name, the criteria to be Lumbee, and their bloodline.

I want the Lumbee tribe to know that I respect the individuals whose 
strength, courage and determination have allowed them to fight for 
their people and to continue the struggle.
