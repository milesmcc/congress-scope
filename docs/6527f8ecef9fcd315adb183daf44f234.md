Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman. And he makes some very good points.

And regardless of how you feel about what's going on in Iraq, and I 
personally have voted three times for a new direction in Iraq, but one 
of the things that I think we can all agree on is that we need more 
accountability for how our tax money is being spent in Iraq. And we 
need to ensure that money is going to provide our men and women in 
uniform with the very best equipment that's available to them today, 
not what was the best equipment 5 years ago, but what is the best 
equipment today to best protect them as they perform their duty and 
service to our country. And that's one thing that we can all agree on.

At this time, I'm pleased to introduce another fellow Blue Dog, a new 
Member in his first term in the 110th session of Congress who is 
rapidly and quickly becoming very involved and immersed in the fiscal 
issues of the Blue Dog Coalition, and that's my friend, Mr. Mike Arcuri 
from New York's 24th Congressional District, who just returned from a 
trip to Iraq.
