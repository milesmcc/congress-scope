Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to speak on Iraq, but first--I 
see the distinguished Senator from Mississippi and the distinguished 
Senator from Pennsylvania on the floor--I will introduce a bill on 
behalf of myself, Senator Specter, Senator Lott, and Senator Reid, 
regarding the insurance industry.

(The remarks of Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lott and Mr. Specter pertaining to the 
introduction of S. 618 are located in today's Record under ''Statements 
on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')
