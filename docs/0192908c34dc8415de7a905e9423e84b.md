`Mr. MILLER of Florida â€” 6 January 2009`

---


Mr. MILLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of 
Sergeant Preston Medley, United States Army. Sergeant Medley was killed 
in action on October 14, 2008 while serving our nation in Qazi Bandeh, 
Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Sergeant Medley 
was assigned to D Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st 
Infantry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.

A 2003 graduate of Baker High School, Preston played football and was 
involved in the broadcasting program. ''He was the energetic, joyful 
kind of person that helped make our program successful,'' one teacher 
said. After his mother passed away in 2005, Preston decided he wanted 
to serve this nation and joined the Army. He will now go to his eternal 
resting place next to his mother in the Pyron Chapel Cemetery in Baker, 
Florida.

While Preston was serving on active duty at Fort Bragg, North 
Carolina, he met his beautiful wife, Sarah, who was a fellow Soldier. 
Sarah gave birth to their daughter, Raelynn, in September 2007 and gave 
birth to their son, Preston Ray Medley Jr. on December 8, 2008. 
Preston's name, his fighting spirit and his caring soul will continue 
to live on through Raelynn and Preston, Jr.

I am always reminded of the greatness of our country by the 
patriotism of those like Preston and the dedication of our military 
families like Sarah and the Medley family. We have an all-volunteer 
military and continue to ask our sons and daughters to travel to 
faraway lands to fight for our freedom. Men and women like Preston 
Medley continue to answer the call.

The people of Northwest Florida have reason to be proud of Sergeant 
Preston Medley for his service and sacrifice for freedom. While his 
passing is a tremendous loss for our country, his selfless service 
stands as a pillar of strength for us all. Vicki and I will keep 
Preston's entire family in our thoughts and prayers. I trust that all 
the people of Northwest Florida and our nation do the same.
