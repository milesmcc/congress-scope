Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, what I have in front of me is the actual 
testimony of Mr. Butler, who says this: ''The Department of State has 
devoted considerable effort and resources helping courageous Iraqis 
establish mechanisms and procedures to investigate and prosecute 
corruption.'' He says, ''It's fair to say we probably do not have a 
program in the ministerial capacity development area that does not seek 
to build an environment in which corruption is less prevalent.'' He 
goes on to talk about what has been done. So he does engage you on this 
issue of corruption.

I think you could have gone to a classified session, as was invited 
by Mr. Butler, you could have gone to a classified session, he invited 
you to do that, and he would give you the details on that particular 
conversation. Incidentally, the particular conversation that you're 
talking about is the one that is manifested in your resolution. It's 
not this statement that you have just given me. It's the one that is in 
your resolution. You could have had him do that in private.
