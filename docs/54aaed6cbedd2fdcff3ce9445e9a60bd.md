# RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT

`Mr. PENCE â€” 12 July 2007`

Mr. PENCE. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman and my good friend 
from Florida for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, we are come to this floor today, it seems to me, in an 
important moment in the life of two nations. We are come to this floor 
at a time when our colleagues in the other body are debating a Defense 
authorization bill and will be considering amendments about a new 
course in Iraq.

So I do not question the decision of the majority in this chamber to 
consider these same issues, particularly in light of the release of the 
initial benchmark assessment report by our military and diplomatic 
leadership in Iraq. It is a report, I must confess, Mr. Speaker, that 
is to me frustrating, as it is, I think, to Members on both sides of 
this aisle. Of 18 benchmarks included in the interim report to 
Congress, progress on eight of the benchmarks has been characterized as 
satisfactory, but progress on another eight are unsatisfactory, with it 
being too early to tell on another two.

Two months from now, the Crocker-Petraeus report that Congress has 
been promised will provide, we believe, a broader assessment. But, 
frankly, I am struggling, as a strong supporter of our effort in Iraq, 
with the failure of this Iraqi Government to step forward with progress 
toward enacting legislation on de-Ba'athification reform, hydrocarbon 
resources reform, and the scheduling of and planning of provincial 
elections.

Mr. Speaker, I want to be transparent about that frustration as much 
as I was when I met with Iraqi cabinet officials just a short 2 months 
ago. The Iraqi Government must do more. If there is any unintended 
benefit of this debate today, my hope is that some of this debate with 
that message would echo to those people.

But that being said, I will oppose this measure, Mr. Speaker, because 
I truly believe that defeat and an American failure in Iraq is not an 
option that we can consider.

With great respect to my colleagues who would endorse this proposal 
for a precipitous American withdrawal from Iraq by April 1 of next 
year, I truly believe that, before we make any decision adjusting our 
strategy on the ground, we ought to wait to hear from those Americans 
on the ground in Iraq who have been charged with implementing the 
strategy the President put into effect in January.

I want to reiterate, and I think I speak for many Republicans, Mr. 
Speaker, as the President said in January, our commitment to this Iraqi 
Government is not open-ended. But my commitment to an American and 
Iraqi success is deep and heartfelt. Whether this Iraqi Government can 
rise to that challenge or not, as the gentleman from Indiana in the 
other body said, we must find a way to forge agreement to achieve 
success in Iraq.

The good news of the assessment that has come before the Congress is 
that we have been achieving some progress as a result of the 
President's surge strategy on the ground. Between May and June, 26 
high-level al Qaeda leaders have been killed or captured.

I know there are some, even the gentleman who just spoke, who 
questioned whether we are fighting al Qaeda in Iraq. Our soldiers don't 
question that. Eleven of those al Qaeda leaders killed or captured were 
emirs, local al Qaeda leaders; seven were facilitators who smuggled 
foreign weapons; and five were cell leaders who commanded terrorist 
units.

U.S. operations in the last 2 months, according to the reports 
released this week, have also uncovered an al Qaeda media network in a 
nondescript facility outside Samarra. U.S. forces also, I am happy to 
report, received 23,000 tips during this period of time, which is four 
to five times the number of tips we were receiving last year.

But, again, that goes against the backdrop of disappointing news. 
While the American soldier performs with courage and effectiveness, the 
Iraqi government still fails to demonstrate the urgency.

So as I struggle, I would just ask my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle who share my concerns about the lack of progress in Iraq, as 
to this solution you bring to the floor, how will your plan for a 
unilateral withdrawal keep American soldiers safe?

We have 160,000 soldiers there now. The majority of this Congress 
would call for them to exit Iraq by April 1. Well, in effect it would 
take 3,000 large convoys, according to some press reports, to evacuate 
the country down the one road out through Basra and into Kuwait.

Also I would ask, how would this plan for unilateral withdrawal 
decrease the number of terrorist safe havens in that country? And since 
al Qaeda is clearly in Iraq, how would the plan for unilateral 
withdrawal succeed in fighting al Qaeda in Iraq?

Lastly, I say as the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee, 
how will a withdrawal, a precipitous, reckless, irresponsible 
withdrawal, make the Middle East safer and more stable?

I fear if we lose Iraq, we will lose Israel. We must come together as 
a Nation to find a way forward to succeed in Iraq.
