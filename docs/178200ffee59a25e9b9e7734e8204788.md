`Mr. DUNCAN â€” 1 August 2007`

---


Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Water 
Resources Development Act, one of the most important bills we will take 
up in this Congress and I think certainly one of the most important 
environmental bills; and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. Hastings) for yielding me this time.

This bill contains flood control projects, environmental restoration 
projects, wastewater system improvements, water projects all over the 
country in rural areas, small towns, medium-size cities and large 
cities. And in many of these areas, our water systems are 50 or 75 or 
even 100 years old and are in desperate need for work and improvement 
and, many times, new construction.

I had the privilege, as my friend from South Carolina (Mr. Brown) 
mentioned, of serving as chairman of the Water Resources and 
Environment Subcommittee for 6 years; and during that time, as the 
gentlelady from California (Ms. Matsui) mentioned, we passed the WRDA 
bill twice, once with only 8 votes against it, once with only 14 votes 
against it. Unfortunately, the bill did not pass in the Senate.

In this Congress, under the leadership of my good friend, Chairwoman 
Eddie Bernice Johnson, and my friend, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
Baker), and certainly under the leadership of our full committee 
chairman, our outstanding chairman, Mr. Oberstar, the gentleman from 
Minnesota, and the Ranking Member Mica from Florida, this bill passed 
not only the House, but it passed the Senate by a vote of 91-4. So 
there is tremendous support, bipartisan support, for this legislation 
from people all over the country.

You know, if an automobile needs an oil change and you don't get it, 
a very low-cost matter, an engine can later explode and cost thousands 
of dollars; and that's sort of the situation we're in with many of our 
water systems from around the country. As several people have noted, 
this is a 7-year bill, and it deals with these water needs that have 
built up over all of that time.

I think it's a very fiscally conservative bill. As expensive as it is 
in one way, it's only a little over a month and a half of what we're 
spending in Iraq. And comparing these 7 years of built-up needs to what 
we're doing in the little over 1/1/2/ and a half months in Iraq, I 
think makes this a very conservative bill.

I had the privilege of chairing the Aviation Subcommittee for 6 years 
before I chaired the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee for 6 
years, and in both of those areas I saw that there were very strong, 
competing interests in those areas. But, in this bill, we brought all 
these competing interests together. There was a great deal of 
compromise that went on and a great deal of work was put into this 
legislation.

I'm very proud to support this bill. I think it's good for this 
Nation. I know it's good for my home area of east Tennessee, where we 
have so many water needs.

Mr. Speaker, I just want to commend everybody who has worked so hard 
on this legislation. It's very important for this country. There is 
nothing that the people in this country take for granted like we do our 
clean water and wastewater systems, and we desperately need this work 
to be done.

I think this is a bipartisan legislation that all of our colleagues 
can and should support.
