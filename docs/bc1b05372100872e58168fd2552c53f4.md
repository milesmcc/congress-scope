# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

`Mr. EHLERS â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise, reluctantly, in opposition to this 
resolution. I say ''reluctantly'' because I had hoped to be able to 
vote in favor of something positive, a fresh perspective, a new idea, a 
new pathway to success, anything to encourage and foster a positive 
outcome in the Iraq conflict. But this resolution offers none of these 
things. It is a simple, almost meaningless, nonbinding statement of 
disapproval that provides no constructive resolve on this daunting, yet 
critical mission.

My opposition is both procedural and substantive. I am extremely 
disappointed that we only have this one simplistic, inadequate 
statement before us for consideration. No alternatives, no other ideas, 
no solutions. The situation in Iraq is complicated, and the American 
people deserve far more from Congress than a resolution that 
essentially calls for the status quo.

The resolution opposes the troop surge called for by the Commander in 
Chief, but fails to offer or even allow for consideration of any 
alternatives aimed at achieving success in Iraq, nor does it offer an 
alternative aimed at a reduction of troops.



There are other ideas out there worthy of consideration and 
discussion, yet we are not debating those, including those suggested by 
the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. For example, the study group concluded 
that there is no single action that the military can take that, by 
itself, can bring about success in Iraq. I agree with that assessment. 
Regardless of a troop surge, I believe a positive outcome in Iraq 
requires regional cooperation and positive engagement with all of 
Iraq's neighboring states.

A case can be made for a troop surge, but even more, we need a surge 
in diplomacy to create an environment conducive for a lasting peace 
throughout the Middle East. The history of the region is too diverse, 
too complex, and too tumultuous to expect progress without an 
integrated diplomatic effort and multinational support. Of course, this 
simple resolution before us offers no perspective on these matters.

In a few weeks, this body will have the opportunity to vote on 
funding for ongoing operations in Iraq. Forget today's resolution; the 
vote on the supplemental funding bill is where the real debate will 
occur, and the policies will be laid forth. Make no mistake, a cutoff 
of funds and a premature withdrawal of troops from Iraq will produce 
even greater sectarian violence, further deterioration of security 
conditions, and would foment a terrorist breeding ground for radical 
Islamists. We, the Members of Congress, must give our troops the 
resources they need to carry out their critical mission to a successful 
conclusion.

In closing, let me say that we all unequivocally support the troops 
who are serving and who have served in Iraq, and we all deeply 
appreciate their efforts to carry out their duties. Every day I think 
about the 3,000-plus American troops who have died in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and I pray for their families, as well as for our troops 
that are there now. I think about the thousands more who have been 
injured, and the tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens who have 
been killed or injured as a result of this conflict. We must do all we 
can to ensure that those casualties were not suffered in vain. Above 
all, we must seek to end this conflict and stop the casualties.

Simply put, the resolution we are debating offers no path to success, 
and that is why I oppose it.
