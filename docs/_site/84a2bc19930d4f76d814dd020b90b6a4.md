Mr. TANNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

This Sunday, Ukrainians will go to the polls to elect a new 
President. The successful conduct of these elections is important to 
our country, the United States. As Vice President Biden said during his 
visit to Kiev last summer, ''we consider Ukraine to be a vital European 
partner for advancing stability, prosperity, and democracy on the 
Continent.''

Six years ago, the Orange Revolution demonstrated the Ukrainian 
people's desire for freedom, democracy, and prosperity. Since that 
time, Ukraine has made great strides in developing a vibrant civil 
society, an open and free press, and a government accountable to its 
citizens. We welcome the government's registration of over 450 
international observers for the elections, including from the OSCE and 
the International Republican Institute. We would take this means and 
opportunity to urge all parties in the elections to cooperate fully 
with the observers and ensure the elections are conducted without 
manipulation.

The United States and Ukraine have a strong bond, not least due to 
the fact that over 1 million Americans trace their roots back to 
Ukraine. These ties were solidified in the Charter on Strategic 
Partnership, which was signed in December of 2008 and which outlined 
numerous areas of engagement and cooperation. Last month, the Strategic


Partnership Commission held its first meeting here in Washington during 
the visit of the Ukrainian Foreign Minister.

Madam Speaker, Ukraine has been a key partner in the efforts of the 
Transatlantic Alliance to ensure international security, contributing 
forces to the NATO mission in Afghanistan and training mission in Iraq. 
In addition, on December 16, Ukraine formally agreed to allow the 
transit of cargo through its territory to support the NATO ISAF 
operations in Afghanistan. Access to the landlocked country of 
Afghanistan is vital, and we applaud Ukraine in assisting to turn the 
tide against the Taliban and prevent safe haven for al Qaeda. NATO has 
made clear that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance at some 
point, if it so desires.

Following the 60th anniversary of the NATO summit in Strasbourg-Kehl, 
I visited Kiev, Ukraine, as chairman of the U.S. delegation to NATO and 
as president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to underline NATO's 
ongoing commitment to Ukraine's process of Euro-Atlantic integration. 
While meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, I expressed the conviction 
that NATO's door should remain open and encouraged the implementation 
of reforms necessary to bring this integration to fruition.

In order for Ukraine to remain on this positive path of political 
development and Euro-Atlantic integration, it is critical that this 
upcoming election be free, fair, and untainted by the fraud and 
irregularities that beset the 2004 polls.

Also, we recognize that Ukraine, like much of the world, has suffered 
greatly from the global financial crisis. Unfortunately, political 
divisions have hampered Ukraine's effort to overcome this crisis and to 
implement the reforms necessary to cement its progress on the road to 
prosperity. These elections are particularly important to ensure the 
Ukrainian Government has a clear mandate from its people that would 
enable it to carry out the difficult decisions necessary to put the 
country on such a path.

Madam Speaker, given the importance of Ukraine as a vital friend and 
strategic partner of the United States, I would urge support for this 
resolution.

I reserve the balance of my time.
