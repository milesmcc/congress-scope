Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1315, 
the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2007, which would expand 
housing assistance for disabled veterans of the United States Armed 
Forces.

The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act amends title 38 of the United 
States Code so that specially-adaptive housing assistance can be 
provided to certain members of the Armed Forces who are disabled and 
residing temporarily in housing owned by family.

America's veterans have sacrificed in the defense and well-being of 
our country and should be rewarded for their bravery and compensated 
for their sacrifices. Therefore, we have a duty to see to it that the 
appropriate benefits are made available to every disabled veteran, 
regardless of residential status. We must remember that with nearly 
30,000 troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, more young veterans are 
in need of disability assistance.

Mr. Speaker, this bill provides the necessary revisions that will 
enable more veterans to receive the special housing assistance they 
need. I fully support this bill and encourage others to do so as well.
