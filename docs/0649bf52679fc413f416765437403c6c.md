Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.

I notice there is no listing at this point of an Iraq bill on next 
week's schedule. I also notice that FISA modernization has not been 
scheduled. I wonder if the gentleman has any information about the 
potential for either of those two issues to be on the schedule for next 
week.
