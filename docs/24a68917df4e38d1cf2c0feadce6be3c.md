Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the 
amendment. It is offered by Senator Smith and myself. Refugees who come 
to this country are entitled to loans to help them defray the cost of 
transportation and to resettlement assistance once they arrive. I am 
for that.

This amendment provides similar benefits to those who qualify for 
Special Immigration Visas. These are Iraqi and Afghan translators who 
have helped us, and now, in risk of their lives, are allowed to come to 
a safe haven, the United States.

This amendment extends a helping hand to those who have helped us 
under very difficult and dangerous circumstances. As I indicated, 
refugees are entitled to this benefit for up to 7 years. This provides 
benefits for only up to 6 months for the SIV holders.

It is carefully crafted. It has been scored at not adding additional 
costs to the budget. I think this is a matter of basic fairness. I urge 
my colleagues to support the Cardin-Smith amendment.
