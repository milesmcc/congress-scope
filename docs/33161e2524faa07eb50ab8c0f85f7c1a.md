Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy 
in recognizing me and in working with us.

For over 60 years, Oregonians have provided a benefit to our 
returning veterans of home loans that were below market rate to be able 
to help them reestablish themselves in the community and as a small 
gesture of our appreciation for their sacrifice. Unfortunately, with 
the recent flood of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, we 
found that that program has been stretched to the limit and we were 
faced with denying them access.

Working with Mr. Neal, Chairman Rangel, the committee and 
subcommittee, we were able to make an important adjustment, a 400 
percent increase in the loan cap, so that we will be able to fully meet 
the needs of returning Oregon veterans, and along the way it will help 
people in Alaska, Wisconsin, Texas, and California. In this time of 
uncertainty in the housing market, giving these important loans to our 
veterans is an important gesture. I appreciate the work that the 
committee has done to make this a reality.
