Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for the candidness of that answer.

I also remember and remind him that last week on the topic of the 
expanded GI benefits, the supplemental, under the rules we've been 
working with, would be considered, at least the wartime part of that, 
an emergency spending and not under the PAYGO rules. The GI benefits 
that have been talked about both here and on the other side of the 
building, I think last week you suggested that those were related to 
the Iraq-Afghanistan expenditures in a way that you thought that the 
majority might waive PAYGO and include those in the supplemental.

I'm wondering if any of those other items that you discussed, like 
unemployment insurance, might also meet that criteria where if they 
were in the supplemental, they wouldn't have to comply with the PAYGO 
provisions of the current rules of the House.

I would yield.
