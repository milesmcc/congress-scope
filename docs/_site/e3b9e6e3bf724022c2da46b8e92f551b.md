Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I want to pay tribute to a remarkable soldier, and 
another true American hero, Chief Warrant Officer Aaron Weaver, who at 
the age of 32 paid the ultimate price while in defense of his country.

On January 8, 2004, he was on his way to have his blood work tested 
for cancer when the Black Hawk he was riding was shot down, killing all 
on board. As was noted before, Aaron was a testicular cancer survivor. 
He was still being treated when his unit was called to active duty in 
Iraq. He could have stayed at Fort Bragg, but that wasn't like him. His 
father said, He wanted to go to Iraq. When you're in a close group like 
that, you don't want your friends to leave you behind.

As an Army Ranger, Weaver survived the October 1993 battle of 
Mogadishu in Somalia that was recounted in the book and film ''Black 
Hawk Down.'' His heroism in saving a friend's life was also featured in 
that documentary on the battle. Not only was Chief Warrant Officer 
Weaver a fighter, he was a husband, a father, and a son. He was proud 
to serve his Nation. And with gratitude for his bravery and sacrifice 
to his country, I would urge all members to join me in supporting H.R. 
3530.

I yield back the balance of my time.
