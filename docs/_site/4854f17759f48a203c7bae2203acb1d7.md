Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the sacrifices of 
American men and women serving our country overseas and to urge my 
colleagues to support legislation I introduced to give them a much-
deserved pay increase for facing dangerous situations.

Late last year, I traveled to Afghanistan and was privileged to meet 
members of our Armed Forces serving our country in a difficult and 
dangerous environment. Two of those soldiers approached me and said 
they had not seen a combat pay increase in several years and asked me 
to do what I could do to make the burden of overseas deployment easier 
for them and their families.

As a result, when I got back to Washington, I introduced H.R. 4440, 
the COMBAT Act, which provides several types of combat pay increases, 
including hostile fire pay, imminent danger pay and family separation 
allowance. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting our troops and 
their families by becoming a cosponsor of this bill.
