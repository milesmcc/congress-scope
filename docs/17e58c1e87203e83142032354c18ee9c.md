Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as we continue the debate 
of opposing reinforcements for American forces in the global war on 
terrorism, I am reminded of how crucial it is that we achieve victory 
to protect American families.

The current situation in Iraq reminds me of a smoldering fire in an 
urban area. Proper equipment and a sufficient number of professional 
firefighters are brought in to put out the fire. To sit back, overlook 
the seriousness or leave the scene of the fire only enables the fire to 
grow, become more intense and spread throughout the neighborhood.

This analogy is applicable to Iraq. As Secretary of Defense Robert 
Gates said recently, the violence in Iraq, if unchecked, could spread 
outside its borders and draw other states into a regional 
conflagration. Just as we know our fire chiefs would call up additional 
firefighters to contain a spreading fire, we must give our troops in 
Baghdad the chance to suppress violence and stabilize the region, which 
protects American families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget 
September 11.
