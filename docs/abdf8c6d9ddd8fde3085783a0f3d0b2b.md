`Mr. FORTENBERRY â€” 4 August 2007`

Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, on July 21, Sergeant Jacob Schmuecker 
was killed in Balad, Iraq, when a roadside bomb detonated near his 
vehicle. Jacob leaves behind his wife and their children, 4-year-old 
Dillon, 3-year-old Kierstan, and 19-month-old Bryce, along with his 
parents, Rodney and Patricia, four brothers and three sisters.

Sergeant Jacob Schmuecker grew up in the Nebraska towns of Atkinson 
and Norfolk. He attended West Holt High School and Northeast Community 
College. He felt a calling to serve, and at the age of 21 enlisted in 
the Nebraska National Guard.

In September of 2006, Jacob's unit deployed to Iraq. Jacob, the 
recipient of numerous decorations for outstanding service, was second 
in command.

In speaking with Jacob's mother, Patty, last week, she told me that 
in Jacob's last e-mail he prayed, if something had to happen, that it 
would happen to him and not one of his fellow soldiers. Perhaps God 
answered Jacob's prayer. In the infinite mystery of life and death, 
what is clear is a life worthily lived is marked by selflessness and 
sacrifice.

Sergeant Jacob Schmuecker gave the ultimate sacrifice out of duty and 
love of country, and America is forever indebted to him.
