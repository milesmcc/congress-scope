Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Lance 
Corporal Alfonso Ochoa, Jr., who was recently killed by a roadside bomb 
in Afghanistan.

A native of Armona, California, Alfonso joined the Marine Corps only 
after graduating early from Hanford High School. His enthusiasm to his 
country and his commitments were apparent to all who knew him. It is my 
hope that Alfonso's strength, valor, and pride in our Nation will serve 
as an example for all of us.

My thoughts are with his father and mother, as well as his wife, whom 
he just married 6 months ago, and go out on behalf of all Americans.

In addition, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to mention that two other


servicemembers from the Central Valley recently sustained serious 
injuries overseas, and I wish them and their families comfort and 
strength during these difficult times and a speedy recovery.

Staff Sergeant Christian Hughes and Senior Airman Phillip Newlyn, 
both of Fresno, California, are at Walter Reed Medical Center; and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in honoring these soldiers, their courage, 
and their service to their country and wish them a smooth and speedy 
recovery.
