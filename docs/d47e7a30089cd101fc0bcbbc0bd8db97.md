# EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED
## `d47e7a30089cd101fc0bcbbc0bd8db97`
`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 17 February 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. That is the issue before the U.S. Senate. Many of us do 
not believe that this President is right on it. The Baker-Hamilton 
commission did not agree with that policy. General Abizaid did not 
agree with that policy before the Armed Services Committee. And the 
American people don't.

We on this side are interested in protecting American servicemen from 
the crossfire of a civil war. Some on the other side are more 
interested in protecting the President from a rebuke for his policy of 
escalation in Iraq.
