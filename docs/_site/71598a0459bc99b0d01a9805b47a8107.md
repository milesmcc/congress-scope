Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday a petition 
signed by nearly 3,000 men and women currently serving in Iraq was 
accepted by the House of Representatives by Leader Boehner. The appeal 
simply states, ''As an American currently serving my nation in uniform, 
I respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to fully support 
our mission in Iraq and halt any calls for retreat. The war in Iraq is 
a necessary and just effort to bring freedom to the Middle East and 
protect America from further attacks.''

This petition was organized by two U.S. servicemen serving in Iraq, 
Lieutenant Jason Nichols and Staff Sergeant David Thul. In a statement 
released yesterday, they said, ''We are respectfully asking for full 
support in finishing the mission you assigned us here in Iraq. Patience 
and resolve will result in a stable democratic country in the Middle 
East. Early withdrawal will result in a stronger enemy, a weaker 
America and a demoralized united armed forces. We need your support to 
finish the job.''

Mr. Speaker, these are the thoughts of men and women fighting this 
war. We owe it to them to listen. They've earned it.
