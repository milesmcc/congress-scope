# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `dc00ca687738ecbeda2e58988cd5b8ab`

Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Madam Speaker, I submit it is not General Petraeus 
that we are questioning here. It is the decision of our Commander in 
Chief, our President, his decision to deploy some 20,000 troops, 
additional troops to this mess that we created in Iraq. We planned and 
carried out this war on the cheap, saying we only needed 140,000 when 
in fact the experts said we needed at least 250,000 or 300,000 to 
complete and do the job. That didn't happen. So why do you think that 
adding another 20,000 troops is going to make that much difference? 
That is what is at issue and I think this is what we need to debate on.

Madam Speaker, I gladly yield 5 minutes to my good friend from North 
Carolina, Mr. Butterfield, a member of the Armed Services Committee.
