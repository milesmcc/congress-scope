Mr. SHADEGG. Our minority leader, Mr. Boehner, introduced a bill 
identical or very similar to mine. There have been other pieces of 
legislation. I just want to make it clear that I think that this is a 
grave error on so many fronts it's hard to explain. And it's worth 
maybe trying to lay out some of those points for anybody who'd just 
listen. Number one, I think the gentleman made a good point of this 
earlier. If you bring terrorists to the United States, there is, first 
and foremost, the danger that by merely being physically present in the 
United States, they will acquire rights that they do not have in 
Guantanamo Bay, that they do not have in Iraq, or that they did not 
have in Afghanistan.
