Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator.
















 Exhibit 1



























U.S. Senate,



















 Washington, DC, May 16, 2008.


 The President,


 The White House,


 Washington, DC.



 Dear Mr. President: Each day, as America contends with 


 rising gasoline prices, we see and hear stories of how 


 individual Americans are coping with this serious problem as 


 they conduct their daily lives with their families and in 


 their work environments.



 They are finding ways to reduce their consumption of 


 gasoline by driving less, altering daily routines, and even 


 changing family vacation plans. These efforts bring 


 hardships, but save dollars that are necessary to meet 


 essential family needs. And while small in comparison to the 


 overall problem of supply and demand of gasoline, these 


 efforts do add up. I never dismiss the American ''can do'' 


 spirit.



 In one word, it is individual conservation. And in cases 


 such as this, when individuals are leading the way, the 


 government should join.



 The purpose of this letter is to urge you to lead the vast 


 federal government to likewise take initiatives to cut back--


 even in a small measure--its daily consumption of gasoline 


 and other fuels.



 I believe such a move would signal to Americans that their 


 government is sharing the daily hardships occasioned by this 


 turbulent, uncertain energy crisis.



 Having worked in and with the Department of Defense for 


 many decades, and recognizing that this government department 


 is the largest user of petroleum products, I believe that the 


 men and women of the armed services would pitch in to share 


 the hardships on the home front and lead the effort. Their 


 families are experiencing many of the same hardships as other 


 families across America.



 Recognizing that our nation must maintain its defense 


 posture, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, where our forces 


 are courageously carrying out their missions, the 


 department's initiative to further conserve on fuels must be 


 done without any harmful diminution in readiness or training.



 By cutting back the number of flying or steaming hours in 


 our military ships and planes, by even a percentage point or 


 two, the armed forces could point with pride to their efforts 


 in our nation's conservation movement.



 With kind regards, I am





 Sincerely,



























John Warner.
