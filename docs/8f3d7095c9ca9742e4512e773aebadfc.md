Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to a resolution that 
does nothing to end the war in Iraq.

Does H.R. 3087 call for our troops to immediately be brought home? 
No, it does not.

Does it at least call for redeployment over several months, or even 
years?

No, it does not.

Or at the very minimum, does it demand that the Pentagon actually 
develop and outline to a Congress a strategy on how redeployment might 
occur? No, it does not. As introduced, the bill would have done so. But 
in committee, this weak bill became even weaker.

There's no there there, if there ever was.

All the bill does is require the Department of Defense to report to 
Congress on the status of planning for redeployment.

Let's not kid ourselves about what the result of today's resolution 
will be. Every 3 months, President Bush's Secretary of Defense would 
tell Congress that the administration has not and will not develop a 
plan for the withdrawal of all our brave men and women in uniform.

That much I already know. I don't need a Bush lackey to repeat the 
bad news on a quarterly basis.



The only plan President Bush has is to keep our troops in harm's way 
for years if not decades. He wants to continue wasting tens of billions 
of dollars abroad while domestic needs go unmet at home.

I urge all my colleagues to vote against H.R. 3087 and instead 
support an immediate end to the war in Iraq.
