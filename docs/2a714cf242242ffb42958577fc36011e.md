# WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007

Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me be very clear: I in no way suggested 
my friend from Virginia didn't act in good faith. That is the story of 
his life. I just say, another study? Look at the one in the newspapers 
today. They studied what is going on in Iraq today with the explosive 
devices--the people getting killed and maimed and injured. How many 
more studies do we need? The study that has already been completed in 
the minds of the American people is to change course in this civil war. 
We have too many people being killed and injured in that war. The 
course needs to change. I care a great deal about my friend from 
Virginia, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I have to call 
his amendment what I think it is. It is my opinion it is weak.















 Amendment No. 1098
