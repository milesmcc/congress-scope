Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me the 
opportunity to speak this afternoon.

I strongly support the rule. I strongly support our men and women in 
uniform who are courageously fighting to defend our freedoms. In my own 
district, we lost 14 soldiers. My recent trip to Iraq confirmed that to 
support our troops is to support their redeployment. Our troops told me 
they were overextended and underequipped. Many are on their second, 
third and fourth tour. They face increased risk without proper 
equipment and longer stays. In fact, not enough equipment was available 
for those new incoming soldiers that were just deployed by this 
President. That is what I heard from our troops when I visited there 
about a month ago.

Extending the tours of all active-duty personnel is unacceptable, a 
price our families shouldn't have to pay, nor our troops. As Members of 
Congress, we have the responsibility to protect and


provide for the best interests of all of our troops. That includes the 
redeployment out of Iraq and a safe return home.

I urge my colleagues to support the rule and vote for these bills to 
support our troops.

One last comment. I want to thank the Speaker of this House for 
having the courage to allow us to vote on these very important pieces 
of legislation this day. It is indeed a historic day.
