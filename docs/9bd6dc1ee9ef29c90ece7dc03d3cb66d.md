Mr. REID. I say to my friend, everything we have done for the past 7 
months has been in spite of the roadblocks, the obstruction tactics the 
Republicans have put up. We have done it in spite of that. We have to 
this point 43 different cloture motions--43. We have never done that 
before, 43.

I say to my friend, on a Defense authorization bill--the bill that 
takes care of our troops around the world, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and 
the work we are doing with NATO forces, to get pay increases, get them 
the right equipment, the right medical care--this is being held up.

I would also, in a way of response, ask my friend, what has happened 
in the past dealing with Defense authorization bills? Has there ever 
been anything like this that you can imagine?
