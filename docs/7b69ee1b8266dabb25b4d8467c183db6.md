Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, In 1885, former Congressman and 
Senator Gilbert Hitchcock founded what would become the largest 
employee-owned newspaper, and the newspaper with the highest percentage 
of subscribers in a home circulation area, in the United States. This 
paper, the Omaha World-Herald, recently celebrated its 125th 
anniversary of bringing the news to Nebraskans' and Iowans' hands and 
homes.

The Omaha World-Herald has won many awards through the years, 
including three Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the senseless violence 
against African-Americans in Omaha in 1919, the large-scale scrap-metal 
drive in Nebraska during World War II, and an emotional photograph of a 
World War II soldier's homecoming to Iowa. One of its most recent 
awards was bestowed by the Columbia Journalism Review for its coverage 
of the war in Afghanistan.

Notably, the Omaha World-Herald is one of the few remaining 
independently-owned papers with statewide coverage. This is shown in 
its localized content and strong commitment to community. 
Congratulations to the Omaha World-Herald on 125 years of reporting and 
serving Nebraska's communities.
