Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentleman.

I would pose a question, if I may, to the gentleman from Connecticut, 
who as Congressman Dent said has been to Iraq 17 times and chaired the 
Subcommittee on Terror. I know he was consulted with respect to the 
Iraq Study Group report or at least I believe was consulted with 
respect to the Iraq Study Group report and see if he would share his 
perspectives on the value of the Iraq Study Group report in terms of 
generating some bipartisan cooperation and moving us in the right 
direction in Iraq.

I would yield to the gentleman.
