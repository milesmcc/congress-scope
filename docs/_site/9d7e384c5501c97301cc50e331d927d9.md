# LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010--CONFERENCE REPORT--
## `9d7e384c5501c97301cc50e331d927d9`
`Mr. McCAIN â€” 30 September 2009`

---


Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will quote partially from the letter:




 The President's defense budget request has requested no 


 additional C-17s. This position is based on the Department's 


 firm judgment that we have acquired a sufficient number of C-


 17s to meet the Nation's military needs.


Let me point out what is really important about this letter:




 More specifically, the $2.5 billion it will cost to 


 purchase 10 additional C-17s, plus the $100 million per year 


 it will cost to operate them, will invariably result in a 


 reduction in crucial warfighting capability somewhere else in 


 the defense program.


So the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, all of our military leaders, and the highly respected Secretary 
of Defense say not only that they don't want any more C-17s, but if we 
spend this $2.5 billion and the $100 million annually required to 
maintain them, there will be a reduction in critical warfighting 
capability somewhere else in the defense program.

We are in two wars. We have 68,000 young Americans in Afghanistan--
and most likely more to come--and 120,000 in Iraq, and we are going to 
buy 10 more C-17s when they need their equipment maintained and they 
need to be replaced and they need to fly and they need to have the best 
capability in combat.

President Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex. 
It is not the military industrial complex anymore; it is the industrial 
complex. You cannot walk through the hallways without bumping into a 
lobbyist from Boeing. Of course, there are subcontractors all over 
America, absolutely. But this is really egregious because they have 
taken money from the operation and training capabilities and readiness 
capabilities--that is what operations and maintenance money is all 
about--and cut it below the request our military and the Secretary of 
Defense and the President think is vitally needed, and they added 10 
additional aircraft that no one in the military--the Air Force 
included--believes is needed.

This is a young Presidency, and this will be a defining moment in the 
Presidency. If I am defeated by Boeing today, then it will be up to the 
President to decide whether to veto this bill. If we don't turn this 
down here, then we will be sending a signal to every lobbyist in this 
town--and there are thousands--that if you lobby hard enough and you 
have enough subcontractors, you can do anything.

This is a very important amendment at this particular time in our 
history, while we are fighting two wars and we have a new 
administration. If we defeat this amendment, we will also be 
contradicting the opinion of perhaps one of the most highly regarded 
individuals in America, and, of course, that is our Secretary of 
Defense.

Mr. President, I have already asked for the yeas and nays on this 
amendment. I believe we can do a better job for the American people and 
the men and women in the military than what is being attempted by the 
Defense Appropriations Committee.

I yield the floor.
