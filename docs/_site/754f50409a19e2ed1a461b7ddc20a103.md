Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, I was stationed at the Pentagon when 9/11 
happened. A few months later, I was on the ground in Afghanistan as 
head of the Navy's anti-terrorism unit for a short mission. I watched 
as the Taliban and al Qaeda flowed across that border over to Pakistan. 
And then came that tragic misadventure in Iraq. We took that edifice of 
security of our Special Forces and others and placed them in that 
country. And what we might have done to truly have better won this 
global war of terror with the other elements of power, such as fix the 
illiteracy rate of women in Afghanistan, which is 98 percent, never 
occurred.

I support the President's policies not because of Afghanistan--it has 
spiraled too far downward to try to resurrect what we once might have 
done--but because of Pakistan, the most dangerous place in the world.

It should have sent chills down everybody's back when General Hayden, 
3 years ago, said al Qaeda now has a safe haven in Pakistan where we 
cannot go, several hundred of those criminals there to plan safely 
against us.

I support the President's policy because, as General Gates said in a 
closed hearing in December, we need to seal that border. So as 
Pakistan, once united now again with us, moves to North Waziristan 
through the Taliban on its side of the border to eradicate the danger 
to us, the safe haven of al Qaeda, that they do not flow back over into 
Afghanistan whence Pakistan, who created the Taliban, might once again 
spread its bets.

If Pakistan becomes a failed state and al Qaeda remains, we may get 
out the nuclear weapons. But there are 2,000 nuclear-trained scientists 
in that nation who have access to the radiological material and the 
knowledge in a failed state potentially controlled by the Taliban and 
al Qaeda that endangers us.

I support this President's policy in a limited window of opportunity 
to help Pakistan eradicate, yes, the danger to them, but to us, that al 
Qaeda.

I strongly do believe that this President still needs to provide this 
Nation something, however, and that is what he promised us a year ago, 
and that was an exit strategy. Every warrior knows that when you go 
into battle, you have an exit strategy, which is merely benchmarks by 
which you measure success or failure. And if success succeeds, exit, 
and if the costs of failure become greater than success, exit to an 
alternative strategy. I believe that needs to be provided to this


Nation who, after 7 or 8 years of war, deserves to see how its national 
treasure is being used and if it is being successful.

But as I end, to my colleague from Ohio, I served for 31 years with 
the wonderful men and women of this Nation.
