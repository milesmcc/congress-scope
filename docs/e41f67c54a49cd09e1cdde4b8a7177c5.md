`Mr. BROWN â€” 15 April 2008`

Mr. BROWN. Yes, there is strong support. I appreciate the comments of 
the Senator from California. There is strong support for this bill, but 
not just in those groups. I had in my office building trades people 
from Mansfield, Lima, Cleveland, Dayton, and Columbus. They were 
talking about the kinds of jobs--good-paying jobs--in our State on road 
crews, such as the operating engineers and laborers and all kinds of 
workers that are paid decent wages. It is a stimulus, as the Senator 
says. It injects money into our economy immediately. These are ready-
to-go projects. We need to fund them so we can work immediately to 
create these jobs, which will spin off and create other jobs.

But it is the same old story. We have had 65 filibusters from 
Republicans to stop us from moving forward on everything from health 
care, to education, to ending the war in Iraq, to jobs programs such as 
this. This is the best kind of jobs and economic development program. 
Not only will it create jobs immediately, but it makes it much easier 
for economic development and for people to bring new business into 
communities because the infrastructure is more modern.
