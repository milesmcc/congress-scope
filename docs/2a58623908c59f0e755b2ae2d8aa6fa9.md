Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, SSG Shannon Weaver was killed 
on May 21, 2007, in Baghdad, Iraq, when his vehicle was struck by an 
I.E.D. Staff Sergeant Weaver was assigned to the A Company, 425th 
Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 25th Infantry Division stationed in 
Fort Richardson, Alaska.

Staff Sergeant Weaver had previously completed two operational 
deployments and was on his second tour of duty in Iraq. Staff Sergeant 
Weaver will be dearly missed by family and the community of his youth, 
Piedmont, Alabama. Shannon was a graduate of Piedmont High School where 
he was a member of the football team. His former teammates recall a 
young man known for his strong will and determination.

Words cannot express the sense of sadness we have for his family and 
for the gratitude our country feels for his service. Staff Sergeant 
Weaver, like other brave men and women who have served in uniform, died 
serving not just the United States but the entire cause of liberty. 
Indeed, like those who have served before him, he was a true American.

We will forever hold him closely in our hearts, and remember his 
sacrifice and that of his family as a remembrance of his bravery and 
willingness to serve our Nation. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the 
House's remembrance at this mournful occasion.
