Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, today I honor Chief Special Warfare 
Operator Adam Lee Brown, 36, a Navy SEAL from Hot Springs who died in 
Afghanistan March 18. My heart goes out to the family of Chief Special 
Warfare Operator Brown, who made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of 
our Nation. According to those who knew him best, he was a caring, 
compassionate individual, who always put others ahead of himself. He 
was in his eighth tour of duty in Afghanistan and is survived by his 
wife, two young children, and his parents.

Along with all Arkansans, I am grateful for the service and sacrifice 
of all of our military service members and their families. More than 
11,000 Arkansans on Active Duty and more than 10,000 Arkansas 
Reservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September 11, 2001.

It is the responsibility of our Nation to provide the tools necessary 
to care for our country's returning service members and honor the 
commitment our Nation made when we sent them into harm's way. Our 
grateful Nation will not forget them when their military service is 
complete. It is the least we can do for those whom we owe so much.
