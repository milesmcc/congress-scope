Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished Republican whip for yielding; 
and I would tell him on Monday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for 
morning hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will 
consider several bills under suspension of the rules, as we usually do; 
but there will be no votes until 6:30 p.m. on Monday.

On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour 
business and noon for legislative business. We will consider additional 
bills under suspension of the rules, a complete list of which will be 
available by the end of the week. We also expect to consider H.R. 1227, 
the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act, which has been reported 
out of the Financial Services Committee.

On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. On Friday, 
the House will meet at 9 a.m. We will consider the U.S. Troop 
Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act; the Caller ID/
spoofing bill; and the D.C. vote bill.
