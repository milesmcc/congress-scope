Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, there are real differences when 
we talk about the Democratic and Republican energy plan. We are talking 
about expanding renewable sources of energy, and we are talking about 
creating good-paying jobs here in the great United States of America.

Since January alone, 90,000 Americans lost their jobs; 16,000 of 
those Americans were from the great Hoosier State of Indiana. The 
Center for American Progress just released a report saying if we invest 
$100 billion into a comprehensive plan, we will be able to create 2 
million green jobs in 2 years. We have already spent trillions of 
dollars in Iraq. We can invest $100 billion in a comprehensive plan 
that can employ Americans. Eighty percent of Hoosiers are without 
college degrees; 70 percent of Americans are without college degrees. 
This is an opportunity to help Americans pull themselves out of poverty 
by investing in the green movement.
