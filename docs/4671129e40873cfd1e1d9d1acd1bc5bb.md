# SERVICE MEMBERS HOME OWNERSHIP TAX ACT OF 2009
## `4671129e40873cfd1e1d9d1acd1bc5bb`
`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 2 December 2009`

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the challenges of the ongoing war in 
Afghanistan are immense, but Americans believe in the mission. They 
trust the advice of our commanders in the field to see that mission 
through.

So I support the President's decision to follow the advice of General 
Petraeus and General McChrystal in ordering the same kind of surge in 
Afghanistan that helped turn the tide in Iraq.

These additional forces will support a counterinsurgency strategy 
that will enable us to begin the difficult work of reversing the 
momentum of the Taliban and keeping it from power.

The President is right to follow the advice of the generals in 
increasing troops, and he is also right to focus on increasing the 
ability of the Afghan security forces so they can protect the people.

By doing both, he has made it possible for our forces to create the 
right conditions for Afghanistan--the right conditions for them to 
defend themselves, create a responsible government, and remain an ally 
in the war on terror.

Although our forces are in Afghanistan to defend our security 
interests, the people of Afghanistan must assume a greater burden in 
the future. The President's plan recognizes that.

Once we achieve our objectives--an Afghanistan that can defend 
itself, govern itself, control its borders, and remain an ally in the 
war on terror--then we can reasonably discuss withdrawal, a withdrawal 
based on conditions, not arbitrary timelines.

But, for now, we owe it to the American people, to those who died on 
9/11, and to the many brave Americans who have already died on distant 
battlefields in this long and difficult struggle, to make sure 
Afghanistan never again serves as a sanctuary for al-Qaida. We owe it 
to the men and women who are now deployed or who will soon be deployed 
to provide every resource they need to prevail.















 health care reform


With every passing day, the American people become more and more 
perplexed about the Democratic plan for health care, and they like it 
less and less.

Americans thought reform meant lowering costs. This bill actually 
raises costs. Americans thought reform meant helping the economy. This 
bill actually makes it worse. Americans thought reform meant 
strengthening Medicare. This bill raids it to create a new government 
program that will have the same problems that Medicare does. Americans 
wanted reform. What they are getting is the opposite--more spending, 
more debt, more burdens on families and businesses already struggling 
to get by.

One of the biggest sources of money to pay for this experiment is 
Medicare. This bill cuts Medicare Advantage by $120 billion. It cuts 
hospitals by $135 billion. It cuts home health care by $42 billion. It 
cuts nursing homes by $15 billion. It cuts hospice by $8 billion.

Reform shouldn't come at the expense of seniors. The McCain amendment 
guarantees it wouldn't. The McCain amendment would send this bill back 
to the Finance Committee with instructions to remove the language that 
cuts Medicare. The McCain amendment also says any funds generated from 
rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse should be used to strengthen 
Medicare, not to create an entirely new government program.

A vote in favor of the McCain amendment is a vote to protect 
Medicare. Let me say that again. A vote in favor of the McCain 
amendment is a vote to protect Medicare. A vote against the McCain 
amendment is a vote to raid this vital program in order to create 
another one for an entirely new group of Americans. So a vote against 
the McCain amendment is a vote to take money out of Medicare to create 
a program for an entirely different set of Americans. A vote against 
the McCain amendment is a vote against our seniors, and it is a vote 
against real health care reform.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
