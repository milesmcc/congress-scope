Mr. McMAHON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 1464, a 
Resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of the United States-Japan 
Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and expressing appreciation 
to the Government of Japan and the Japanese people for enhancing peace, 
prosperity, and security in the Asia-Pacific region.

For over 50 years, Japan has served as one of our most dependable and 
consistent allies. The nation has hosted over 36,000 members of the 
United States Armed Forces, promoting regional stability and security 
in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan has been a staunch supporter in our 
efforts to denuclearize North Korea. The nation has recently emerged as 
a proactive force in rebuilding third world countries in efforts to 
curtail the influence of terror cells. In November of 2009, Japan 
pledged over six billion dollars in economic assistance to Pakistan and 
Afghanistan in support of our missions in those countries. This special 
alliance has allowed Japan to establish a prominent role in the global 
community, further contributing to regional and global stability.

The U.S.-Japan alliance has bolstered both nations, making them two 
of the world's largest and most influential economies. Mutual 
cooperation has made Japan our fourth-largest trading partner. Apart 
from strengthening trade with the U.S., Japan has aided our 
international initiatives as well. Japan provided over six billion 
dollars to Guam to develop infrastructure and facilities. This valuable 
ally supports not only our economy, but those of our allies as well.

I am pleased with what Japan has grown to represent. Japan is a 
beacon of democratic thought and practice in the Asia-Pacific region. 
The Japanese government shares our ideals, values, and commitment to 
civil liberties. Despite the constant challenges facing the 
international community and the region, Japan has held steadfast in her 
commitment to egalitarian values and world peace.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives 
to join me today in recognizing and supporting our continuing alliance 
by supporting this Resolution.
