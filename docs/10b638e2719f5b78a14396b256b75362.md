Mr. KUCINICH. This afternoon I will move to refer an Article of 
Impeachment to the Judiciary Committee.

People ask me, don't we have more important things to do? Think about 
this. This war has cost us our constitutionally guaranteed civil 
liberties. Is there something more important?

The Iraq war will eventually cost between two and $3 trillion, 
meaning every American family will pay upwards of $30,000 for this war. 
The war has contributed substantially to higher gas prices. Is there 
something more important?

Over 4,100 of our troops have died, and as many as 1 million innocent 
Iraqis have perished. Is there something more important?

There was never any proof that Iraq constituted an imminent threat to 
our national security, or that Iraq had the capability or intention of 
attacking the United States. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 or al 
Qaeda's role in 9/11. Yet Congress was led to believe otherwise.

The Bible says, ''You shall know the truth and the truth shall set 
you free.'' Congress must know the truth in order for our Nation to 
remain free. In a free Nation nothing is more important than the truth.
