Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the House on the 
occasion of the 20th anniversary of the creation of SOCOM. And today we 
not only pat ourselves on the back for having created SOCOM, but at the 
same time, we honor and recognize all of those military personnel for 
SOCOM who have done so much for this country over the years.

Twenty years seems like a long time, but in the course of history it 
is not a very long time. And if you think about all of the engagements 
that we have had in recent years and the challenges that we likely face 
as a country over the next few decades, SOCOM is going to be around 
with us for quite some time. And it brings to the table capacities that 
we vitally need.



Our experience in Iraq shows us that we simply cannot compel 
indigenous societies to do what we wish them to do. We have got to 
persuade them to work with us to bring peace and security, not only for 
their countries but throughout the world. And in order to do that, our 
special forces, part of SOCOM, are extraordinarily effective.

We have direct action operators, and then we have indirect action. 
Direct action is us, in a very sophisticated way, doing what we need to 
do to affirmatively address with military force, kinetic force, 
problems that we perceive, and SOCOM is very, very effective at 
delivering direct action.

But there is also the indirect action. The ability of special forces 
to work with indigenous populations to get them on our side, if that is 
the right term, and to persuade them to develop their capacity to 
provide security for themselves, which in turn provides security for 
us. We all recognize that, in this new era where there is a growing 
lethality of hatred, where one or two or a small group of individuals 
located somewhere in the world can obtain things that are very, very 
deadly, dangerous to the United States and the Western world, and 
deliver them to us, in an era in which individuals can do this 
worldwide, we have got to be able to network. We have got to be able to


create effective Security Forces among indigenous populations, and 
special forces brings that kind of capability to the table.

So I expect we will grow SOCOM. I expect SOCOM will be in the future 
a very important part of our Nation's defense. I thank all of the men 
and women in SOCOM for the great service they have provided and 
congratulate SOCOM on its 20th anniversary.
