`Mr. BAYH â€” 20 May 2008`

---


Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the 
life of the brave Army sergeant from Knox, Indiana. Joseph Ford, 23 
years old, died on May 10, 2008, in Al Asad, Iraq, from injuries 
sustained when his vehicle overturned during a training operation. With 
an optimistic future before him, Joseph risked everything to fight for 
the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around 
the world.

A lifelong Hoosier, Joseph graduated from Knox High School in 2003. 
His teachers and friends recall a young man with a thirst for knowledge 
and a generous spirit. Shortly after finishing high school, Joseph 
joined the Indiana National Guard and was stationed in New Albany. 
Joseph was fiercely dedicated to serving his country and disciplined 
himself to meet the high standards of military fitness. He enrolled in 
the University of Southern Indiana, where he studied history, a passion 
he had since high school. In June, Joseph married his wife, Karen, of 
Evansville, IN.

Joseph traveled to Georgia in December with his National Guard unit 
for training before he left for his first deployment in Iraq. He was 
scheduled for deployment through 2009 but planned to return this summer 
to celebrate his first wedding anniversary with Karen. Assigned to the 
1st Squadron, 152nd Cavalry Regiment, Army National Guard in New 
Albany, IN, Joseph served as a turret gunner with the Indiana National 
Guard's 76th Infantry Brigade in Iraq.

Today, I join Joseph's family and friends in mourning his death. 
Joseph will forever be remembered as a loving husband, son, and friend 
to many. He is survived by his wife Karen; his parents Sam and Dalarie; 
his brother Matthew; and his sister Abbey Ambrose.

While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take 
pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer 
place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will 
remember when they think of Joseph, a memory that will burn brightly 
during these continuing days of conflict and grief. Today and always, 
Joseph will be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow 
Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made 
while dutifully serving his country.

As I search for words to do justice in honoring Joseph's sacrifice, I 
am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families 
of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ''We cannot dedicate, we cannot 
consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and 
dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power 
to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we 
say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement 
is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain 
that the impact of Joseph's actions will live on far longer that any 
record of these words.

It is my sad duty to enter the name of Joseph A. Ford in the official 
Record of the United States Senate for his service to this country and 
for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I 
think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the pain that 
comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that Joseph's family can find 
comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ''He will swallow 
up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all 
faces.''

May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be 
with all of you, as I know He is with Joseph.
