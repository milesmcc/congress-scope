Mrs. MUSGRAVE. I thank the gentleman for yielding time.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this nonbinding 
resolution. This is not even an honest debate that we are holding here; 
we didn't have an open rule. This is the wrong resolution; it sends the 
wrong message to our troops, to our enemies and to our allies.

Today, like many Members of Congress do on a regular basis, I visited 
Walter Reed. While I was there today, I visited with a young man from 
my district. He had severe injuries. As I sat and talked to him, his 
empty eye socket teared. He had damage to his face. He had horrific 
damage to his arm that he used to protect his face. He was in a Humvee 
when an IED exploded, and he actually turned the Humvee towards the IED 
to protect the other men in the Humvee. His sacrifice is incredible.

I talked to another young man from Pennsylvania who had been on three 
tours in Iraq, and on his third tour, while training, he lost his hand.

I also spoke to a young man from Texas, only 20 years old; and this 
young man had severe injuries, specifically to his arm.

So we all know that the cost of war is very high. Many of us Members 
of Congress have also attended funerals and wept with mothers and 
fathers, families. People in my age group look at these young soldiers 
and they are the age of our kids. It touches our hearts, and we know 
the sacrifices that are made are incredible. These people need to feel 
the gratitude from the entire Nation, gratitude and respect. And I 
believe that this resolution, again, sends the wrong message.

What is not being considered adequately in this country is the cost 
of failure in Iraq. When we think about our enemies being emboldened, 
when we think about the vast resources that our enemies will have 
access to acquire biological and nuclear weapons, the horrific effects 
are just almost immeasurable.

As I think about this cost of failure in Iraq, and indeed, on the 
global war on terror, I think about how we Americans make an 
assumption. We assume, most of us, when we go to bed at night that when 
we wake up, tomorrow is going to be like today, that things are going 
to go on like they have gone on and we will have the liberties and the 
freedoms that we enjoy. But I would say this wonderful thing that we 
have in the United States of America, these freedoms and liberties, are 
very fragile. They are very fragile when we face radical jihadists that 
would murder us,


thinking that it will take them straight to paradise.

We have to fight this war on terror. We have to win in Iraq. I talked 
to a retired general yesterday, and I believe he said it all. He said, 
''You're down there debating, aren't you? You're talking about the 
united-we-quit resolution.'' I believe that we have a choice: United we 
stand or united we quit, and our choice will echo down the halls of 
history.
