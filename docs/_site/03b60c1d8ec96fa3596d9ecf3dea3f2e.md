`Mr. MARCHANT â€” 19 April 2007`

Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, it has been said that a hero is someone 
who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with their 
freedom. Specialist Ryan A. Bishop, 32 years old, certainly understood 
that degree of responsibility.

Ryan enlisted in the United States Army out of a sense of service and 
duty to his country. As his wife of two years Melanie Bishop explained, 
''He believed deeply in what he was doing, and he just wanted to do his 
part.'' The freedom we enjoy as Americans is due in large part to the 
patriotism of such humble citizens throughout our history.

On April 14, 2007, Ryan was dismounted on combat patrol in Baghdad 
when his unit came under the attack of an improvised explosive device. 
Ryan pushed forward with his fellow soldiers as they searched for 
insurgents, terrorists, and others who seek to deny Iraq democracy. On 
that day, our nation lost a genuine hero.

Ryan graduated in 1996 from Tyler Junior College and also attended 
Marshall High School where he was a member of the 1990 state 
championship football team.

He will be missed by a loving family and a nation forever grateful 
for his service and humbled by his sacrifice.
