# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `a95fa871b5f2cfd3bdfc10a54dfef1ce`
`Mr. HOYER â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I was 
watching this debate from my office, and I was constrained to come to 
the floor.

There are legitimate issues raised by this resolution as to whether 
or not you support or do not support the escalation that has been 
proposed by the President. But no one ought to hide behind the troops. 
No one ought to come to this floor and say that this Congress, 435 of 
us, will not support whatever soldier or sailor or marine is deployed 
to Iraq. Whether it is today or tomorrow, they will have our support.

And when we say in this resolution they are serving, it means if they 
are serving, if the Commander in Chief has sent them there, we will 
support them.

And very frankly, for my friend from New Mexico to come to this floor 
and make the representation that somehow we have limited that support 
to those who currently are on the ground is not an honest 
representation, in my opinion.

There are those of us who disagree as to what supporting the troops 
means. My friend, the former chairman of the committee, just got up and 
said he has not gotten any calls lately, but we got a lot of calls in 
in 2003 and 2004 and 2005. And today, Chairman Murtha of the 
Appropriations Committee is saying we do not have the armored Humvees 
for these new troops that are going to be deployed or in the process of 
being deployed.



So when you come to the floor, my friends, debate the substance of 
this policy, but do not hide behind the troops, do not assert that 
anybody on this floor does not have every intention and commitment to 
supporting to whatever degree necessary our young men and women and, as 
I have said, some not so young, who are deployed in harm's way at the 
point of the spear. Because no one in this Congress, and our troops 
ought to know, that no one in this Congress will not support them when 
they are deployed at the point of the spear.
