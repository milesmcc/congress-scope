# LEVIN-REED AMENDMENT
## `11f1ddf53ccba1d2c532874024f335b1`
`Mr. REID â€” 13 July 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Levin-Reed amendment requires the 
President to take steps to responsibly end the war that the country and 
our brave men and women in uniform deserve and demand, but it does not 
set specific troop levels and, certainly, schedules other than what we 
have already indicated, and that is the House-passed version, similar 
to ours, 120 days to start redeploying troops; as of April 1, according 
to the House, and May 1, according to us. There must be a change of 
mission. That change of mission will be directed toward 
counterterrorism, protecting our assets in the area, and also training 
the Iraqis. That is simply what it says.

Senators Carl Levin and Jack Reed are uniquely qualified to offer 
this amendment. They have been joined in this amendment by others, 
including Senator Hagel. This amendment sets a firm date and an end 
date to transition the mission to begin the reduction of U.S. forces. I 
have talked about that. It limits the U.S. mission.

This policy of the President--it is not Petraeus' policy; it is the 
President's--has, during the last 6 months, caused the deaths of over 
600 more American soldiers and cost the American taxpayers more than 
$60 billion. The amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from 
Virginia, Mr. Webb, was a step in the right direction. It was defeated. 
We were not allowed to vote on that. It was offered to give our troops 
the relief they need--15 months in country, 15 months out of country. 
That is serious and important to our troops.

Our troops are in a difficult position. We are 3,000 officers short. 
The morning news reports that 13 percent of recruits, even though they 
are 15 percent down in recruitments, 13 percent of those they have, 
even though they have lowered qualifications significantly, 13 percent 
have criminal records and are going into the military.

Of course, the amendment that is offered by Senators Levin and Reed 
requires that the reduction in force be part of a comprehensive 
diplomatic, regional, political, and economic effort.

The votes we have taken on Iraq thus far make two things very clear: 
First, the Democratic caucus is united in our commitment to changing 
the course of this Iraq intractable civil war. Our resolve has never 
been stronger. Second, until and unless the President awakens to his 
grievous misjudgments, it will take significant Republican support to 
end the war.

This week's vote on the Webb amendment was not encouraging. The 
Republican leadership blocked an up-or-down vote on an amendment to 
support our troops by increasing rest time between deployments. 
Republicans have every right to vote against bills and amendments they 
oppose. If they oppose troop readiness, let them go on record voting 
against it. But to block an amendment like that shows clearly that some 
Republicans are protecting the President and not the troops. Plenty of 
Republicans are talking the right way on Iraq now. They are expressing 
their disapproval for the President's policy, and this is a welcome 
step. But speeches won't end the war; only votes will.

We have a constitutional obligation. Section 1, article 8 says that 
we have an obligation to take care of our troops. We have a 
constitutional obligation. When we return to the Levin-Reed amendment 
next week, a final vote will come. We hope it is not blocked again 
procedurally. I hope all my colleagues, Democratic and Republican 
alike, will embrace this opportunity to finally end a war that has 
caused our country so much harm.
