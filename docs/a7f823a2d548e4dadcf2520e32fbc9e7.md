`Mr. DOGGETT â€” 10 March 2010`

Mr. DOGGETT. We have exercised minimal leverage over Karzai and his 
cronies, who view our continuing presence there as an invitation to 
steal all they can get when they get it. The better exit strategy is 
having fewer troops who need to exit. I agree with General Eikenberry, 
our former commander and now ambassador, who last November questioned 
an escalation that would only ''bring vastly increased costs and an 
indefinite, large-scale U.S. military role.'' He wisely concluded that 
further increases would ''dig us in more deeply.''

In 2001, I voted for the use of force against the enemies that 
attacked us, and I continue to support that effort. But unless we 
pursue a different approach with a more narrow military footprint and a 
pragmatic exit strategy, we will remain embroiled in a land that has 
entrapped so many foreign powers throughout the centuries Afghanistan 
can consume as many lives and as many dollars as we are willing to 
expend there. As in Iraq, we are on a course for a trillion-dollar war 
waged on borrowed money. That must be changed to save American lives 
and America's future.
