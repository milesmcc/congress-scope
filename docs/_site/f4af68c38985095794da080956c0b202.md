`Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey â€” 21 January 2010`

---


Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a 
recently fallen Marine, Sergeant Christopher Richard Hrbek.

He was a field artillery cannoneer with the 3rd Battalion, 10th 
Marines, out of Camp Lejeune. He was stationed in Afghanistan. Sergeant 
Hrbek was an active member of his community back in Westwood, New 
Jersey. He was a volunteer fireman for 9 years. In 2003, in response to 
the attacks on September 11, 2001, he enlisted with the United States 
Marines. He heard the call of duty and he answered it.

As a Marine, he served multiple tours of duty, which included combat 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. On December 23, 2009, under enemy fire, he 
saved the life of his sergeant major, who had stepped on an IED. For 
this, he was to be awarded a Bronze Star with a combat ''V.'' He then 
set the highest example of someone who was willing to risk his life to 
save the lives of others.

Sadly, on January 14, 2010, he, himself, stepped on an IED, and died 
in the service of his country.

He is survived by his wife, Jamie Lynn Wengerter; mother, Cheryl 
Hodges; stepfather, James Hodges; father, Richard Hrbek; stepmother, 
Gail Hrbek; two sisters, Amy Dellentash and Lori Hrbek; and two 
stepbrothers, Jim and Beau Hodges.

His dedication to his country and to his fellow soldiers represents 
his tremendous sense of loyalty and selflessness. Christopher Hrbek is 
a true American hero. Chris will never be forgotten by his friends, by 
his family or by the country he fought for.
