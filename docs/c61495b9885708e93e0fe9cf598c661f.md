Mr. AKIN. There is this transparency promise, that what's going on in 
Washington D.C., the public should be able to see it. You see this kind 
of transparency promise. And then when you take a look at what 
happened, the President first broke the promise of transparency in 
January when he signed this legislation which was the Lilly Ledbetter 
Fair Pay Act. It was passed January 27. And he since continued the 
problem with the State insurance, the SCHIP bill. It wasn't 5 days.

And the reason I mention this is when we came to that supposedly 
stimulus bill, our staffs got that thing at 11:30 at night, and we're 
supposed to vote on a 1,000-plus page bill the next day. Now, I am not 
a speed reader, and my staff doesn't sit around at 11:30 just waiting 
for some announcement from the Democrat Party.

Now I don't understand the transparency in that situation. But I do 
understand a little bit, because I don't know what $780 billion is. I 
started to put it in terms of aircraft carriers, because I understood 
that. I understood that it was more than the war in Iraq for 6 years 
and the war in Afghanistan added to it for 7 years. I understand it was 
more than 250 aircraft carriers. We only have 11 of them. The debt 
service on it was nine aircraft carriers, and it's all money that we 
don't have.

So we have got a series, again, going to this 100 days, there is a 
lot of new records that are being set, particularly in the debt area. 
But there are other kinds of things, I think, that get these people at 
the tea parties upset. One is, have you ever heard of the President 
firing the president of General Motors? I have never seen that before.

I yield to my friend from Texas, Congressman Brady.
