# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `217f51c5e1728ac221c8bd435b22f180`
`Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN â€” 10 March 2010`

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, in closing, I would like to build on 
something that our colleague from California (Mr. Hunter) had said 
earlier about the need to fight and defeat the enemy in Afghanistan so 
that our children or our grandchildren don't have to.

Our men and women in uniform are fighting for their families, for our 
families, for our Nation, for our future. They embrace their mission. 
They are honored by the opportunity to serve. They volunteered for it. 
Let us show our appreciation by voting ''no'' on this damaging 
resolution before us today.

I yield back the balance of my time.
