`Mr. HUNTER â€” 22 May 2008`

---


Mr. HUNTER. I want to yield very quickly to Dr. Gingrey. But first, 
we have that list, and any Member can go look at it but it is not made 
available to the public. And I think there is a safety issue here. I 
think there is a safety issue with respect to the families, the 
children, the wives of the folks that attend this particular 
institution.



And you know something else?

We applaud our military people regularly. We acknowledge that they're 
some of the most honorable of citizens. We trust them with the lives of 
our children and in battles in Iraq and Afghanistan.

And yet it seems like the amendments that come up show quite a bit of 
distrust. We don't trust our interrogators, so now we're going to 
videotape them as if they were stealing candy at a 7-Eleven because we 
don't trust them.

And here we don't trust these great military folks that run WHINSEC 
who, I think, are going to have a salutary effect on the leaders that 
come from other countries that come to this school.

Americans are the best. Our military people are often the very best 
ambassadors for this country. And the idea that we continue to try to 
close down the best ambassadors, so that the people who will offer 
schools to them are people like Hugo Chavez, I think that doesn't make 
a lot of sense.

So as much as I respect my colleague who is offering this amendment, 
I would hope that my colleagues would vote against it.

I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. 
Gingrey.
