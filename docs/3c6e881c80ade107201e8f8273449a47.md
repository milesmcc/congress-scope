# AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
## `3c6e881c80ade107201e8f8273449a47`

Mr. FILNER. The rate of homelessness amongst our troops who served in 
Iraq and Afghanistan is higher. More Vietnam vets have died from 
suicide than died in the original war. That is what these wars are 
doing to our society. These are our children. It's time to take care of 
them. It's time to bring them home. Let's support the resolution on the 
floor.
