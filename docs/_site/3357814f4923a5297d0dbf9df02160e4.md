Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes to just make a 
brief response to a couple of statements that have been made.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Holt referred to our wounded folks in Walter Reed as 
tragic. They are not tragic. They are American heroes, and they are the 
people who have bought the freedom that allows us to have this debate 
today.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield some time to three unusual 
Americans on the Armed Services Committee who all have had sons serving 
in the Iraq theater. The first gentleman is the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Kline), whose son has been a helicopter pilot in Iraq, 
as much time as the gentleman wishes to consume.
