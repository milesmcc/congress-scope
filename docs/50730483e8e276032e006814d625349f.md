Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a course 
correction in foreign policy. The bills before us today reflect the 
will of the American people and the reality on the ground.

We have invested 4 years in a war that was predicated upon the 
fantasy that Iraq would, Iraq could, become a bastion of democracy 
without a massive investment of time, talent, and treasure. This 
President had no plan to win the war he wanted to fight. He had no 
strategy to finish the job he started.

We must bind the wounds of a Nation that has lost over 3,300 men and 
women in a war precipitated by the arrogance of an administration that 
made decisions based upon the world they wanted instead of the world 
that is. We must extract ourselves from what has become a civil war in 
Iraq. We must stand up to a President that is so insulated that members 
of his own party cannot even persuade him to change course.

I have stood in this Chamber to mourn the passing of fallen heroes. 
Sadly, but most assuredly, I will stand here again to mourn more.

But today I stand here asking you to explore your own conscience and 
stand up for our country, our families, and our troops. Let us renew 
our commitment to making the difficult choices we were sent here to 
make, and let us begin today.
