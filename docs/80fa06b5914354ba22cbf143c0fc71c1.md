Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for coming and 
speaking. We are members of the Republican Study Committee. If you want 
to find out a little more about what is in this bill, you can go to our 
Web site, which is House.gov/hensarling/RSC, and find out a little bit 
about the details in this bill.

As the gentleman from Wisconsin pointed out, this is serious 
business. We are responsible for the budget process of the House. The 
House holds the purse strings for the Federal Government; and it is a 
duty that we, many of us, take very, very seriously.

Mr. Speaker, it is of tremendous concern to us when a bill is filed 
at 12:30 a.m., the dark of night, this bill gets filed and within 24 
hours this 3,565-page bill is voted out. And as the gentleman said, 
there is no funding for our troops on the ground in Iraq who have been 
making steady, consistent progress. What a disservice to the troops and 
to the American people.

I want to recognize the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), who is 
chairman of the Republican Study Committee. His Web site, House.gov/
hensarling/RSC, that is where you can get a copy of what is in this 
bill; the $515 billion that is contained in here, plus you can find out 
where some of those gimmicks, budget gimmicks are; plus, you can take a 
look at some of the emergency/nonemergency spending that is also in 
here just so that the majority can spend a little bit more money.

But I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas who chairs the 
Republican Study Committee, Mr. Hensarling.
