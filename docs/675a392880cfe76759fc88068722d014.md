Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with great respect and deep 
sadness that I wish to commend United States Army Corporal Joseph M. 
Hernandez for his bravery and his willingness to fight for his country. 
Corporal Hernandez, who was assigned to 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry 
Regiment out of Hohenfels, Germany, was killed in the Zabul Province of 
Afghanistan when an improvised explosive device detonated near his 
vehicle on Friday, January 9, 2009. His sacrifice will be forever 
remembered by those he fought to protect.

A native of Hammond, Indiana, Joseph graduated from Mount Carmel High 
School in Chicago, Illinois, in 2003. Known for his patriotism and his 
commitment to serving others, it was no surprise to anyone close to him 
that he decided to join the Army.

Joseph's family remembers him as a warm-hearted individual who loved 
boxing, building model airplanes, fishing, and working on cars. Quite 
the talented young man, he also loved to sing, as well as play the 
piano and the guitar, and he played soccer in high school. A person of 
a strong faith, Joseph was active in his church as an altar server and 
cantor, and at one point, even considered entering the priesthood.

Corporal Hernandez leaves behind a loving family that misses him very 
much. He is survived by his devoted wife, Alison (nee Gordon) 
Hernandez, and their two sons, Jacob and Noah, whom Joseph truly 
treasured. Joseph also leaves to cherish his memory his adoring 
parents, Elva Hernandez and Jesse (Vicki) Hernandez, and his brothers, 
Jason and Jessie (Chrissy) Hernandez, as well as his loving 
grandparents, Josephine and Salvador Pompa. He also leaves behind many 
other friends and family members, as well as a saddened but proud 
community and a grateful nation.

Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United 
States Army Corporal Joseph M. Hernandez. Corporal Hernandez sacrificed 
his life in service to his country, and his passing comes as a setback 
to a community already shaken by the realities of war. Corporal 
Hernandez will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his 
community, and his country. Thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he 
made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.
