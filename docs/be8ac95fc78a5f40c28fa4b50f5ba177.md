Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of 
Technical Sergeant Anthony C. Campbell, an Air Force Reservist and 
Cincinnati police officer from Florence, Kentucky. Sergeant Campbell 
made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation on December 15, 
2009, in Afghanistan while serving with the 932nd Civil Engineer 
Squadron.

Tony Campbell was a model citizen and patriot. His dream was to serve 
in the military and in law enforcement. After graduating from Boone 
County High School in 1992, he joined the U.S. Air Force. After active 
duty, he spent 10 years working as a pipefitter and Air Force Reservist 
before fulfilling his dream to become a Cincinnati police officer. Tony 
was recalled to active duty and deployed to Afghanistan in October of 
2009.

Today, as we honor the service of this exceptional Kentuckian, my 
heartfelt prayers are with Tony's wife, Emily, their children, Jordan, 
Ryker and Devin, and his loving parents. We are all indebted to Tony 
for his bravery, dedication, and willingness to answer the Nation's 
call to defend freedom.
