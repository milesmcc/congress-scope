Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Long Island for his insight on 
this resolution to put an end to war profiteering and demand 
accountability on how the American people, the hardworking American 
people's tax money is being spent in Iraq.

I yield back to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).
