Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 3997, the 
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

President Bush tells us that we face unparalleled financial doom if 
this $700 billion bailout is not approved today. He and his Treasury 
Secretary--a former Wall Street fat cat--tell us that we have reached 
the point of ''crisis.'' That is a familiar line from this President. 
It sounds like the disastrous rush to war in Iraq and the subsequent 
stampede to enact the Patriot Act. As I opposed the Iraq War and the 
Patriot Act, I stand in opposition to his latest rush to judgment.

We are not in a sudden crisis. It has been building over the past 8 
years of the Bush Administration. Lax oversight of the financial 
industry ballooned into a house of cards.

Homeowners throughout the country have seen property values decline 
as their mortgage rates adjusted upward. As a result, millions of 
people across our country have already lost their homes to foreclosure 
and many more are on the way.

It is easy to blame consumers for purchasing homes they couldn't 
afford. However, these consumers weren't informed of the extreme risk 
they were assuming. Creative financiers invented a market for these 
risky mortgages and preyed upon consumers by peddling the American 
dream of homeownership to make that market flourish.

While those were poor choices by consumers, they pale in comparison 
to the irresponsible bets made on Wall Street. These mortgages and 
their declining collateral values are the root of this financial 
crisis.

We now face a choice. President Bush tells us we must inject $700 
billion into this market to avoid a total meltdown. He and Secretary 
Paulson say it is the only answer. Many economists--who don't have a 
financial stake in Wall Street or an 8-year record of bad decisions--
tell us it isn't the only choice. An option would be to assist 
homeowners with their mortgage payments. By making sure these mortgages 
remain viable, the market should stabilize.

The bill before us today is basically the same three-page Wall Street 
give away first put forth by President Bush. The fig leaf adjustments 
are not enough to outweigh the fact that, no one knows if this bill is 
what's needed. I'm not willing to make a $700 billion gamble that 
President Bush is right after 8 years of seeing all that he's done 
wrong.
