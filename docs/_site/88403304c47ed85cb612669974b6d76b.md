Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I voted in support of the Ensuring 
Military Readiness Through Stability and Predictability Deployment 
Policy Act of 2007, which mandates a minimum period of rest and 
recuperation for units and members of the regular and reserve 
components of the Armed Forces between deployments to Iraq.

At a time when our generals warn that the Army is at a breaking 
point, this is an important stand in support of troop readiness and 
keeping faith with our military families. It is also another step 
forward in forcing the responsible drawdown of our troops from Iraq and 
ending the war. I believe we must bring our troops home as quickly as 
possible and work to stabilize Iraq through political and diplomatic 
efforts. I will continue to support any legislation that moves us 
closer to the end of this national nightmare.
