`Mr. HATCH â€” 22 October 2007`

Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also rise today to pay tribute to one of 
Utah's fallen soldiers. SPC Jason N. Marchand was a member of the 2nd 
Cavalry Regiment and at the time of his death was deployed as part of a 
2-week field tour north of Baghdad.

Specialist Marchand's told his family that he joined the Army to 
protect his family and friends. Before his deployment to Iraq, 
Specialist Marchand spent the previous year and a half in Germany, 
which his mother said he loved.

Specialist Marchand was born on April 8, 1981, in Salt Lake City, UT, 
to his parents Debbie Parsons and William Marchand, M.D. Specialist 
Marchand had a special relationship with his family. His mother stated 
they were open enough to share anything with one another.

Specialist Marchand leaves behind a wife and a 6-year-old daughter, 
Savannah. At the funeral of Specialist Marchand, Savannah said that she 
wanted to release some balloons for her father. She wanted them to fly 
up to heaven to be with him there.

Specialist Marchand is a fine example of an honorable U.S. soldier. I 
am grateful for brave individuals like Specialist Marchand who give 
their life to create a brighter future for their family, friends, and 
Nation.

(At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to 
be printed in the Record.)
