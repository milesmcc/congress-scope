Mr. JONES of North Carolina. I thank the chairman for this time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2956.

For more than 4 years, our men and women in uniform have faithfully, 
skillfully served in Iraq. This legislation makes clear that the 
Government of Iraq must now be responsible for Iraq's future.

Mr. Speaker, when Marine General ''Jack'' Sheehan, a former top NATO 
commander, declined to serve the White House as war czar for 
Afghanistan and Iraq, he stated his reasons for not accepting this 
position: ''The very fundamental issue is they don't know where the 
hell they're going.'' That is what Marine Corps GEN Jack Sheehan said. 
General Sheehan's statement is why the Congress and the administration 
need to work together to develop an end point to the war strategy in 
Iraq. It is time for Congress to meet its constitutional responsibility 
by defining what victory in Iraq will look like.

Stay the course is not the answer. As Colin Powell said last week, 
''We have to face the reality of the situation that is on the ground 
and not what we would want it to be. It is not a civil war that can be 
put down or solved by the Armed Forces of the United States.'' Colin 
Powell, I quoted him. That is his statement.

We are now in the 5th year in Iraq, and 3,611 Americans have died in 
the war. Mr. Speaker, to this date I have sent over 6,400 letters to 
the families and extended families of our men and women in the military 
who have lost their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq, and every time I 
sign a letter, my heart aches.

Chairman Skelton's plan provides a comprehensive strategy to maintain 
and advance the diplomatic, political, and economic components of 
United States national security interests in Iraq. It has taken this 
country in a direction that it needs to consider.

Mr. Speaker, I close by reminding this Congress what Rudyard Kipling 
said in his writings known as ''Epitaphs of War,'' and we need to all 
be responsible for this, and this is my quote from him: ''If any 
question why we died, tell them because our fathers lied.''
