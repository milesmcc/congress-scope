Mr. ALLARD. Exactly. We hear frequent mention on this floor about the 
other, non-Iraq dangers facing this country, and our national missile 
defense system is designed to deal with some of the most worrisome of 
those threats--an accidental or rogue nation launch of ballistic 
nuclear weapons against our country. I am sure the chairman and ranking 
member agree on the value of this system, and that a system as 
technologically complex as this one requires constant analysis, 
demonstration, and integration?
