# IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL

Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, House Republicans believe that 
our commanders on the ground in Iraq deserve to have the resources and 
flexibility they need to lead our troops in harm's way during this 
critical phase of their mission.

On the other hand, Washington Democrats would rather use our troops 
to make a political statement than work in a bipartisan fashion to get 
our brave men and women in uniform the funding they need to succeed in 
their mission.

I thought the San Diego Union Tribune made a good point in an 
editorial stating: ''And even though this sham bill is merely a 
political show, the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate 
managed to lard it up in nearly $25 billion in wasteful pork, most of 
it entirely unrelated to war funding.''

It's time the Democratic leadership send the President a clean 
supplemental. It is simply unacceptable for Democrat leaders to 
restrict the necessary funds our troops need so political points can be 
scored with their defeatist base.
