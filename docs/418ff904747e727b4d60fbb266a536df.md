`Mr. SESSIONS â€” 3 December 2007`

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to offer a bipartisan 
bill to fix a serious loophole in the law that has prevented some of 
our wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan from receiving their 
full enlistment bonuses when they are discharged as the result of 
wounds they receive in combat. The Wounded Warrior Bonus Equity Act 
reflects the hard work of several Members of Congress, who put 
partisanship aside to address this serious matter. The men and women of 
our magnificent armed forces serve with incredible courage and bravery. 
In return, the U.S. makes a commitment to them, and the Government must 
fulfill its end of the bargain.
