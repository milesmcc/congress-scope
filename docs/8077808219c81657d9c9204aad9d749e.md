Mr. HUNTER. I thank the ranking member, and I would like to associate 
myself with the chairman's remarks on this issue.

I think I'm the only one on the floor here who's actually served in 
Afghanistan. I served twice in Iraq as a United States Marine. I would 
have to respectfully oppose this amendment, and the reason is this: The 
best exit strategy is to actually win. That's the best exit strategy. 
To go in there, win the fight, kill al Qaeda, kill Taliban, have the 
State Department work with the local Afghan people, then we can leave 
after we have success over there. That's how we won in Iraq. We won in 
Iraq. Once we stopped worrying about losing, we had the surge, and now 
we're successful in Iraq. That's what we need in Afghanistan. The way 
that we're going to lose Afghanistan is if we start focusing on how 
we're going to pull out successfully. What we need to do is win, win 
hard, and win strong, and then we can all come home.
