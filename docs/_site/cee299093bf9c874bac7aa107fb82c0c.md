Ms. SUTTON. Thank you, Congressman Klein.

I couldn't agree more that we need to have that kind of a plan. And 
unfortunately, a plan for responsibly redeploying and a plan for 
dealing with the broad scope of protecting America and what's in 
America's best interest is not being offered up. In fact, it's not even 
being discussed, because we're having the same discussion that we've 
been having for years now about staying the course in Iraq.

I would like to shift it over to my colleague from New Hampshire, 
Representative Carol Shea-Porter, who I know can shed a great deal of 
light on this as well as a member of the Armed Services Committee.
