Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, three members of the Army National 
Guard's 1132nd Military Police Company based in Rocky Mount, North 
Carolina, were recently killed in support of our Operation Iraqi 
Freedom after an improvised explosive device detonated near their 
vehicle.

Twenty-seven-year old Sergeant David B. ''Blake'' Williams, of 
Tarboro, North Carolina, was from my district. He was serving a second 
tour of duty in Iraq, and was recently awarded a second Army 
Commendation Medal for his exceptional service during combat duty.

A few moments ago, Madam Speaker, I spoke to Susan Legett Williams, 
the mother, and Mary Beth Williams, the sister, to express not only 
sympathy from the Congress of the United States of America but to 
express appreciation from a grateful Nation.

May God bless the entire Williams family during this difficult time 
in their lives.
