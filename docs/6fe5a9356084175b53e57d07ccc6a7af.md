# IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL

Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, the House is scheduled to take up an 
emergency supplemental spending bill to fund our troops in Iraq. But 
the other side has worked themselves into a dilemma over this bill to 
pander to their left-wing base. The Democrats have included language in 
the bill that sets an arbitrary date for withdrawing our troops, 
whether we have achieved victory or not. While that pleases the far 
left, the more moderate Democrats are rightfully concerned about 
congressional micromanagement of the war. So what is the solution? Load 
the bill up with pork to pressure Members to vote for it.

At last count, the supposed emergency supplemental now contains more 
than $20 billion in unrelated spending. I think most Americans agree 
that the money they want to spend on spinach subsidies and peanut 
storage would be better spent on body armor and Humvees for our troops.

Madam Speaker, this bill fails both our troops in combat and the 
taxpayer here at home. Let's stop playing politics with emergency war 
funding, Madam Speaker. Let's have a clean supplemental.
