Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I'm not going to apologize for trying to keep 
my arsenal, the 7,500 jobs there that produce armor to keep our troops 
safe in Iraq. I'm not apologizing for trying to save the community of 
Galesburg that lost a plant because of unfair trade policies to Sonora, 
Mexico. I don't apologize for writing things and asking for money. It's 
the taxpayers' money.

I don't apologize for anything I came here to work on. I will 
continue to work. But let me tell you, I'm not going to go through 
another night like I had last night. I'm going to be very vocal, and 
I'm going to stand up and I'm going to defend the people of this 
district.

I'm going to defend our leadership because I don't think they need 
defense, but I think they need to know there are a lot of us that 
really believe in what they have been doing.
