Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the issue of 
Iraq, to call on the President to sign the supplemental appropriations 
bill, the emergency bill that we will be sending him, and also to pay 
tribute to 43 young Americans who have been killed in Iraq from my 
State since January 30, 2007. This brings to 720 the number of soldiers 
who were either from California or based in California who have been 
killed while serving our country in Iraq. This represents 22 percent of 
all U.S. deaths in Iraq.

I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record their names, 
their ages, the circumstances of their death.
