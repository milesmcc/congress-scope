`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 27 June 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have broken borders. The 1986 act had 
no enforcement mechanism, and that was under a Republican 
administration. We are not bringing that up. We have 12/1/2/ million 
immigrants. You can say we are going to ship them back, and it will 
take $250 billion and 25 years to be able to do it. Buses will stretch 
from Los Angeles to New York and back again. Are we going to do that? 
No, we are going to take another route and just exploit them and not do 
what is in this legislation, which makes them pay a fine and 
demonstrate that they are going to work hard and learn English and 
provide for their family and give something back to America, like they 
do when their sons and daughters serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. You 
will be able to stay here under the Bond amendment, but you are going 
to work for an employer. When you get tired of working, we are going to 
report to the INS that you are out of status, and out you are going to 
go, lock, stock, and barrel. It will be just sweat labor here.

We are going to have two Americas. You may not like our solution, but 
it is preferable to this alternative, which will create a permanent 
underclass. I think it would be a mistake.
