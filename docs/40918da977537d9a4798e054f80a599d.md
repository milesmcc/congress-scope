`Mr. YOUNG of Alaska â€” 24 October 2007`

Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 586 members 
of the Alaska Army National Guard's 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry who 
recently returned from their yearlong deployment to southern Iraq and 
Kuwait. The guardsmen have been successfully serving as security forces 
in northern Kuwait and southern Iraq since October 2006, guarding camps 
and convoys heading into Iraq. The guardsmen come from all over my 
State, with members of the unit hailing from 80 different communities 
across Alaska including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Kodiak, Soldotna, Kenai, 
Nome, and many native villages. The unit also included National 
Guardsmen from New York, Mississippi, Illinois, Georgia, and Puerto 
Rico.



This was the largest deployment of the Alaska National Guard since 
World War II and thankfully all 586 guardsmen who were deployed 
overseas returned home safely. Many of these guardsmen had never left 
Alaska prior to joining the National Guard, but none hesitated to serve 
their country.

As I told the National Guardsmen at their welcome home ceremony at 
Camp Shelby, Mississippi, ''You can't support the troops unless you 
respect them. And I humbly respect you because you have done your job 
as you were charged to do so, and as volunteers. You left your families 
and you went forth and accomplished what you were taught to do.''

I truly believe that the importance of the National Guard to our 
country cannot be overstated, which is why it is important that we 
honor these citizen-soldiers. For this reason I am introducing the 
following resolution to honor these Guardsmen for their outstanding 
service to our country.
