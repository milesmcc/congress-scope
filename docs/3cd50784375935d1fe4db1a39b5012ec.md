Mr. REGULA. Madam Speaker, with great sorrow I rise today to 
recognize Specialist Zachary Grass, an Ohio citizen from my district, 
who gave his life fighting for our country. On Saturday, June 16, 2007 
in Iraq, Army soldier Zachary Grass was killed by a roadside bomb.

As a 2003 graduate of Fairless High School, he was a member of both 
the varsity basketball and baseball teams. From his athletic 
involvement in high school to becoming a soldier in the Army he showed 
great leadership. More importantly he was happy to be serving his 
country.

This outstanding young man showed courage and dedication during his 
tour of duty. Zachary is a true hero and reminds us of the dedication 
evidenced by all the men and women all over the world fighting the war 
on terror. We must reflect on this great life and the sacrifice he made 
to defend our freedom and security.

Zachary Grass and his family will be forever in our hearts and 
prayers. May we keep them in mind as they struggle through this 
difficult period of mourning.
