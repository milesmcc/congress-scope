Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, let me just say to my friend, I just reviewed it the 
other day, and I don't need to look at any statements by George W. Bush 
about whether or not we should have gone into Iraq, because the most 
damning statements about Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass 
destruction, the most conclusive statements that indeed he must have 
them and that he must be brought to justice quickly, were not made by 
George W. Bush. They were made by people with the last name of Clinton, 
of Gore, of Kerry. I reviewed all of the videotapes of their speeches 
in which they absolutely laid out a case against Saddam Hussein.

So I hope we don't replow the ground of who shot John here in terms 
of statements with respect to the state of Iraq and its weapons of mass 
destruction.

I think we need to get back to the substance of this debate, and that 
is, are we foreclosing an immediate response if it is necessary.
