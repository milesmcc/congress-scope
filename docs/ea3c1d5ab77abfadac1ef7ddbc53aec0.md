# HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES

`Mr. LAUTENBERG â€” 24 May 2007`

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today is going to be a day of great 
importance to America. We are going to be voting on the supplemental 
bill to fund the surge and the number of soldiers on duty in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. But last night we learned the body of one of the missing 
soldiers in Iraq was found. Despite our prayers, he was dead. We were 
informed that the body of Joseph Anzack, Jr., was pulled from the 
Euphrates River south of Baghdad.

On May 12, he and two of his colleagues went missing after they were 
ambushed by insurgents. How did the capture of three Americans take 
place? Are we short of troops to back them up or is it so dangerous we 
just can't overcome the odds we face?

All of America is hoping and praying, as we keep these other two 
soldiers in our hearts and our minds, that they will be found alive by 
the troops searching for them.

One of the soldiers searching for their two colleagues said something 
to the Associated Press. I quote him here.




 It just angers me that it's just another friend that I've 


 got to lose and deal with, because I've already lost 13 


 friends since I've been here and I don't know if I can take 


 it anymore.


Much of America feels the same way. Outside of my office in 
Washington we have a tribute called ''The Faces of the Fallen.'' 
Visitors from across the country have stopped by this memorial--
pictures of those who perished. I encourage my colleagues to come and 
see these photographs displayed on placards on the third floor of the 
Hart Building.

Since the beginning of May, and we are now at the 24th of May, the 
Pentagon has announced the deaths of 75 of our troops in Iraq and 
Afghanistan coming from thirty-one different states. I want them to be 
remembered.

Today, I am going to read their names into the Record. As we listen 
to the names, the real cost of this war is being felt in many homes 
across this country.

Mr. President, as you heard, this list includes two brave men from 
New Jersey--I visited their families--SSG Vincent Vincenzo Romeo and 
SGT Sameer Rateb. Staff Sergeant Romeo was from Lodi, NJ, and Sergeant 
Rateb was from Absecon, NJ.

It also includes SGT Allen J. Dunckley. His funeral is taking place 
today at 10:30, 5 minutes from now. His family is from Glassboro, NJ. 
PVT Anthony J. Sausto lived in Hamilton Township, NJ.

We cannot forget these brave men and women. The Nation cannot afford 
to forget their sacrifice. We have to remember that these brave souls 
left behind parents and children, siblings, friends. Their sorrow will 
last forever. We want them to know the country thinks about them, and 
we make a pledge to preserve their memory with the dignity that those 
who served and paid this price deserve.

I yield the floor.
