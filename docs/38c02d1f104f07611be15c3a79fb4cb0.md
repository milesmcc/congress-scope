`Mr. BURTON of Indiana â€” 25 April 2007`

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say that appeasement and weakness 
led to World War II, and 62 million people died. We are now in the 
nuclear age, and we have an enemy that will tie a nuclear weapon or 
plastic explosives around themselves and blow themselves up. If they 
come to America with a nuclear device, a suitcase nuclear device, they 
could destroy this place and kill all of us three blocks away from here 
by detonating that kind of a device.

Remember, they are our mortal enemy. Osama bin Laden said it. They 
are in Iraq. We have got to stand firm.
