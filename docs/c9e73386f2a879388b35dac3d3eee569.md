Mr. REID. These gallant men and women need time off from the trauma 
of war, as I said, to see their families and reconnect to their normal 
lives.

The Webb amendment is simple. It states if a member of the active 
military is deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, they are entitled to the 
same length of time back home before they can be redeployed.

It also states that members of the Reserves may not be redeployed 
within 3 years of their original deployment, which will not only give 
them time to recover from deployment, but will restore our Reserve 
forces to respond to emergencies here at home.

Mr. President, I am going to use my leader time right now.
