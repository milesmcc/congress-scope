`Mr. DODD â€” 3 March 2008`

---


Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to mark the loss of an outstanding 
American intellect--and, what's more, a decent and a well-loved man. 
William F. Buckley, Jr., died last week at the age of 82. He was found 
at work at his desk, pen in hand--and I don't think he could have 
imagined a more fitting exit.

Few thinkers were more prolific than Bill Buckley--his total 
catalogue amounts to more than 50 books and thousands and thousands of 
columns, not to mention his three decades on the pioneering debate 
program ''Firing Line.'' Few writers wielded more influence--the entire 
modern conservative movement honors him as its founder. And few figures 
in our national life earned such admiration-- all the way from Ronald 
Reagan, who told Buckley, ''You didn't just part the Red Sea--you 
rolled it back, dried it up and


left it exposed, for all the world to see,'' to the many writers, 
activists, and leaders who counted him as a mentor and inspiration.

He was a good friend of my parents, Thomas and Grace Dodd, and one of 
Connecticut's best-known native sons. I was especially proud to see him 
in attendance at the dedication of the Thomas J. Dodd Library in 
Storrs; like my father, Bill Buckley was a dedicated foe of 
totalitarianism in all its forms.

In the wake of his death, tributes have risen from left and right and 
from every point in between. Even those who stood against Bill's 
staunch conservatism respected his intellectual rigor and integrity. In 
the inaugural issue of National Review, which Bill launched in 1955 at 
the age of 30, he wrote this: ''Our political economy and our high-
energy industry run on large, general principles, on ideas--not by day-
to-day guess work, expedients and improvisations. Ideas have to go into 
exchange to become or remain operative; and the medium of such exchange 
is the printed word.'' It was that commitment to ideas, to reasoned and 
courteous debate, that we appreciated most in Bill and that we will 
miss most.

His intellectual honesty spared neither himself nor his friends. When 
he changed his mind--as he did on civil rights, on Vietnam, and on 
Iraq--he did it publicly and forthrightly. And long after the movement 
he founded took on a life of its own, Bill continued to hold it to his 
high standards and to call it to account. In his last years, he wrote: 
''Conservatives pride themselves on resisting change, which is as it 
should be. But intelligent deference to tradition and stability can 
evolve into intellectual sloth and moral fanaticism, as when 
conservatives simply decline to look up from dogma because the effort 
to raise their heads and reconsider is too great.''

Bill resisted dogma, not because it was often wrong but because it 
was always lazy. He was too energetic for that. And while he pioneered 
new thinking, worked to rid the conservative movement of xenophobia, 
and even staged a quixotic run for mayor of New York City--asked what 
he would do if elected, he replied: ''Demand a recount!''--he developed 
a one-of-a-kind prose style and public persona. ''I am lapidary but not 
eristic when I use big words,'' he said. Those are my thoughts exactly.

Bill Buckley lived a full life, devoted to words, to ideas, and to 
his deeply-held principles. We didn't agree on much. But given his 
grace, his wit, and his deep erudition, I can think of few people with 
whom disagreement was so agreeable.

I request unanimous consent that the attached article, ''May We Not 
Lose His Kind,'' be printed in the Record.
