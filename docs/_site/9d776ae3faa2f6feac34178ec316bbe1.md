Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in strong opposition to 
the Democrat-sponsored emergency supplemental. I fully support funding 
our troops, but I will not be coerced into voting for a politically 
motivated deadline that helps our enemy.

As an appropriator, I am deeply disappointed that the important 
mission of funding our troops in harm's way has been overshadowed by 
over $21 billion in nonemergency spending. There is an appropriate time 
and place to discuss the war and funding important projects, but it 
shouldn't be done on the backs of young Americans fighting overseas.

Setting deadlines and threatening to restrict funds emboldens our 
common enemy and will have disastrous effects on the morale of American 
and Iraqi troops fighting to bring security to our war-torn region. 
Bringing troops home before the situation has been stabilized won't end 
our global struggle against terrorism. It would do the opposite.

I urge Members to oppose the supplemental. Our troops deserve to be 
fully funded, and they clearly deserve the support required to succeed. 
General Petraeus deserves time to work his plan. He is the general on 
the ground, not the Congress.
