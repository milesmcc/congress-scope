Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I would like to paraphrase a 
poem that Rudyard Kipling wrote upon the death of his son in World War 
I that seems particularly apt to the war in Iraq:

When they ask why the young men died

Tell them it's because the old men lied.

Madam Speaker, when the White House announced 4 years ago the U.S. 
military would attack Iraq under the guise of the global war on 
terrorism, there wasn't one single uniformed military officer who 
believed that Iraq was part of a global war on terrorism. Saddam had 
had nothing to do with the 9/11 attack.

Saddam wasn't harboring any al Qaeda cells that did attack us. In 
fact, they understood that starting a new war would distract us and 
limit us from accomplishing our immediate need to eliminate Osama bin 
Laden. Saddam was a vicious, secular, despotic dictator, but he saw al 
Qaeda as a threat to his control, and al Qaeda viewed Saddam as an 
enemy of their religious extremist world vision.

The U.S. Intelligence Community knew that there was no clear evidence 
that Saddam was a threat to the United States. There was no failure of 
our professional Intelligence Community, but there was an abysmal 
failure of our political leadership.

So how did we get to this point? First we were scared with the threat 
of Saddam's arsenals or weapons of mass destruction, al Qaeda training 
camps, an Iraqi meeting with the 9/11 hijacker, mobile labs, aluminum 
tubing, yellow cake uranium. But there were no weapons of mass 
destruction, Madam Speaker.

The training camps didn't exist. Mohamed Atta never met an Iraqi 
agent in Prague. The White House knew, before they informed us about 
the mobile labs, that our experts had determined that they were not in 
any way related to chemical or biological weapons. Likewise, the 
aluminum tubing was bogus information. Well before the so-called yellow 
cake uranium from Niger was cited as evidence at an attempt at nuclear 
armament, our Intelligence Community had informed the White House that 
it was a hoax.

Yet we were told repeatedly by the President and the Vice President 
that Saddam was a threat to global stability, that there was a direct 
connection between Iraq and al Qaeda and September 11. We were told in 
the buildup to the war that our troops would be greeted by the Iraqis 
as liberators, being offered flowers in the streets. This was 
propaganda that the State Department warned the White House not to 
believe, but they nonetheless peddled it to the Congress and to the 
American people.

We were told that to liberate Iraq was to spread freedom and 
democracy, to keep oil out of the hands of potential terrorist-
controlled states. We were told that the war would pay for itself with 
Iraqi oil revenues. Yet all we have done is to finance our enemies, the 
insurgents and Iranian Shiia interests.

After Baghdad fell, we were told that America had prevailed, that the 
mission was accomplished, that the resistance was in its last throes, 
that more troops were not needed. As things went from bad to worse, we 
were told of turning point after turning point, the fall of Baghdad, 
the death of Saddam's sons Uday and Qusay, the capture of Saddam, a 
provisional government, the trial of Saddam, a charter, a constitution, 
an Iraqi Government, elections,


purple fingers, a new government, the death of Saddam, all excuses for 
triumphant rhetoric while the reality on the ground continued to 
worsen.

We were told, as they stand up, we would stand down. We would stay 
the course. Now we are told that there is a new course, but it is in 
the same misguided direction. Falsehood after falsehood unravels each 
day, with the morning paper reporting even more deaths.

Now the American people are being asked to put 20,000 more sons and 
daughters, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives into the line of 
fire, and into the dead zone between the sectarian sides of a civil 
war. A message was sent to President Bush on November 7, 2006. This 
surge of more troops into Iraq defies the will of the American people.

But this is a new Congress. We will no longer be cowed by leaders 
using 9/11 as a political ploy against sensible people who oppose the 
administration's failed Iraq policy. Today for the first time since the 
war began, Congress will go on record opposing the President's failed 
Iraq policy. Some will argue that it is a nonbinding resolution, that 
it will not have the impact of a law, that it will not stop a roadside 
bomb or bring a single soldier home to their family. But the President 
understands what this resolution means. It is the beginning of the end 
of this wrong war of choice
