Mr. PLATTS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Speaker, I want to first take this opportunity to express my 
heartfelt gratitude and deep respect for our troops and civilians 
serving in harm's way. I have had the privilege of visiting our troops 
in Iraq on four occasions and Afghanistan twice, and they and their 
families are truly the heroes in America.

I rise today in opposition to this resolution, a resolution that 
seeks to maintain the status quo, in essence, to stay the course, a 
scenario that everyone agrees is unacceptable. This resolution offers 
no alternative strategy.

As we consider the challenges in Iraq, we need to remember and learn 
from the lessons of Afghanistan. In the 1980s, we supported the people 
of Afghanistan in defeating the Soviets, helping throw the Soviets out 
of that country. In 1989, when that happened, what did we do? We walked 
away. We did not finish the job. We did not help the people of 
Afghanistan to stand up a secure and stable government. Instead, we 
walked away. Who filled the vacuum? The Taliban, and ultimately al 
Qaeda, a safe haven for them to plan attacks against America and its 
interests.

In 1989, I imagine that few Americans believed that what went on in 
the mountains of Afghanistan would impact the lives of Americans here 
at home. On September 11, 2001, in a tragic fashion we learned that 
that was the case, that what went on in Afghanistan mattered here at 
home. We cannot afford to make the same mistake now in Iraq, to allow 
Iraq to become a safe haven for al Qaeda and other enemies of our 
Nation and our citizens.

The Iraq Study Group offered a comprehensive approach to the 
challenges of Iraq. It included political, diplomatic, and military 
options. As part of the military proposal, it dismissed increasing our 
troop levels by 100,000 to 200,000 troops, saying it was not feasible 
and would lend to the argument of an occupation.

However, the Iraq Study Group did support more limited troop 
reinforcements. And I quote from the Iraq Study Group report: ''We 
could, however, support a short-term deployment or a surge of American 
combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and 
equipping mission if the United States commander in Iraq determined 
that such steps would be effective.''

The report goes on to dismiss the idea of an immediate withdrawal. 
Well, our commander in Iraq today, General Petraeus, an individual 
confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate, is on record 
supporting the need for these additional reinforcements.

Ultimately, the key to long-term success in Iraq is the Iraqi people 
themselves. They need to show the ability and the will to stand up and 
secure their emerging democracy. Having liberated Iraq from a regime of 
terror and torture, our role today is to assist the Iraqis in achieving 
a stable and secure nation. This reinforcement effort is part of that 
effort, along with regional diplomatic efforts and internal Iraqi 
political reconciliation efforts. We are now in the role of helping the 
Iraqis help themselves. We cannot forget the lessons of Afghanistan and 
walk away.

I urge a ''no'' vote
