`Mr. McKEON â€” 27 May 2010`

Mr. McKEON. Let me reclaim my time because here's what's actually 
going to happen. And as I talked to the chiefs on the phone, one of 
them said very clearly, Look. I know how this works around here. I know 
what this means. I know how the amendment was written, that we take the 
vote tonight and then we follow through the process. But it becomes a 
sham because the headline, as he said, would be ''Don't Ask, Don't 
Tell,'' is repealed. And it's already on the headline. I just saw the 
news alert. ''Senate votes to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' He says, 
I understand that. But those troops out at the FOBs in Afghanistan, 
when they


see it, when they hear it, they're going to see it's repealed. Why are 
you now asking me my opinion? It's done. It's a done deal.

So while we may understand that by law that it will follow through 
this process, in reality, it will be set tonight. And that's why we 
should have had more than 10 minutes, 5 minutes on our side, to discuss 
this. All we were given was 5 minutes. And that's why we've had to take 
time.

We could have spent time talking about all of the wonderful things in 
this bill, and yet we've had to talk because this thing is going to 
have more impact on our military and on our country.

You smile, Mr. Leader. And if you really feel that, then why don't we 
just follow the process?

And I'll be happy to yield.
