Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, a homicide 
bomber in Gardez, Afghanistan, mass-murdered 14 civilians and injured 
36 others, including five members of the 218th brigade of the South 
Carolina National Guard. This affects me personally, as I was a member 
of the 218th for over 20 years. In July 2000, we trained together in 
the Mojave Desert at Fort Irwin to face this very evil, and now our 
courageous troops are stopping terrorists overseas.

Chuck Crumbo of The State newspaper reported the suicide bomber 
followed the Guard convoy and detonated himself in the midst of 
innocent women and children on a crowded street. This act of cowardice 
confirms why we must stop the terrorists overseas or they will return 
to America. In the past 96 hours, there was an attack in Baghdad, 
terrorists acted in Lebanon, and a shopping mall was blown up in 
Turkey.

I know my comrades, ably led by General Bob Livingston, are ready to 
face al Qaeda's boast of Afghanistan and Iraq as the central front in 
the global war on terrorism. This is how we can best protect American 
families. I have never been prouder of the Guard's service.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
