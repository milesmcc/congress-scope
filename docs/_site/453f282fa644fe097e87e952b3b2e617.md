`Mr. HAGEL â€” 25 July 2007`

---


Mr. HAGEL. Mr. Presdient, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss 
of U.S. Navy Petty Officer First Class Jeffrey Chaney of Omaha, NE. 
Petty Officer First Class Chaney was killed on July 17 by an improvised 
explosive device in Salah Ad Din Province, Iraq. He was 35 years old.

Petty Officer First Class Chaney graduated from Bellevue West High 
School in 1990. He enlisted in the Navy in 1993 and spent 4 years of 
his 14-year Navy career as a recruiter. Petty Officer First Class 
Chaney's passion for serving his country made him a strong recruiter. 
He was even able to recruit his brother Randy Chaney to the Navy.

Petty Officer First Class Chaney was assigned to Explosive Ordnance 
Disposal Mobile Unit 11, based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, WA. 
His experience with ordnance disposal led to other experiences. He 
worked with Secret Service for President George H.W. Bush's 80th 
birthday celebration in 2004, where he met the former President and 
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. He also assisted Secret Service 
with security during the 2004 Presidential election and met both 
President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry. Petty Officer First 
Class Chaney had been in Iraq for two months. We are proud of Petty 
Officer First Class Chaney's service to our country, as well as the 
thousands of other brave Americans serving in Iraq.

In addition to his brother Randy, Petty Officer First Class Chaney is 
survived by his daughter Brianna Chaney of Omaha, his father Larry 
Chaney of Bloomington, MN, his mother Connie Chaney of Omaha, and 
brother Jim Ecker of Oakland, IA.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Petty 
Officer First Class Jeffrey Chaney.













 Sergeant Jacob Schmuecker


Mr. President, I also rise to express my sympathy over the loss of 
U.S. Army National Guard SGT Jacob Schmuecker of Norfolk, NE. Sergeant 
Schmuecker was killed on July 21 by an improvised explosive device in 
Balad, Iraq. He was 27 years old.

Sergeant Schmuecker graduated from West Holt High School in 1999, 
where he was a linebacker and defensive end on the football team. He 
attended Northeast Community College before he joined the Nebraska Army 
National Guard in 2001 as a member of the 134th Infantry Detachment in 
Lincoln, NE.

He was mobilized for service in Iraq in August 2006 with the Nebraska 
National Guard's 755th Reconnaissance and Decontamination Company based 
in O'Neill, NE.

Sergeant Schmuecker was a model leader. He had a strong concern for 
the men that he led and hoped that if anything were to happen, that it 
would happen to him. He inspired his brother Chris Shepperd to enlist 
and he would go on to serve in Iraq as well. We are proud of Sergeant 
Schmuecker's service to our country, as well as the thousands of other 
brave Americans serving in Iraq.

Sergeant Schmuecker is survived by his wife Lisa and their three 
children, his parents Rodney and Patricia Schmuecker, three brothers, 
and three sisters.



I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SGT 
Jacob Schmuecker.
