Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentleman from California wants to 
claim Iraq as a success, he is entitled to do that. I must say that the 
initial victory was a very deceptive one, because it led to the current 
situation. But the biggest difference between us, I guess, is when he 
cites Lebanon as one of the successful ripples, as he says. In fact, 
the terrible tragedy that went on in Lebanon that was initially 
something that was promising, we have had that war with Hezbollah in 
control in Israel, I think Lebanon is a further sad example of the 
extent to which this misguided and badly run operation in Iraq has 
sadly strengthened the most radical and anti-American forces in the 
Middle East, not weaken them.
