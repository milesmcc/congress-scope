`Mr. EMANUEL â€” 15 April 2008`

Mr. EMANUEL. And the way this was discovered was on a worker who was 
laid off with 10,000 employees, went to go collect unemployment 
insurance and was told no, you don't have the money for that because 
you didn't pay insurance. He said no, I work for an American company, 
and then discovered, in fact, he didn't work for an American company. 
KBR was a company set up in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of 
avoiding paying their fair share of taxes, and it is right here on 
April 15, when Americans are facing bigger tax bills, higher costs for 
health care, higher costs for education, higher costs for gasoline, 
that in fact those companies that are servicing in Iraq pay their fair 
share and not use the tax code to avoid their responsibility.
