Mr. DENT. I too want to commend the gentleman from New York for 
organizing this event tonight, this special order. We need to see a 
little bit more of this type of activity in this Congress, and I hope 
the American people who are watching this exercise tonight maybe find 
this a little bit different or maybe a little bit more refreshing than 
what they are accustomed to during special orders. I just want to thank 
you for putting this together.

One final point. I think Mr. Gilchrest made the point about 
interaction with Syria on a commercial basis in this country. A 
constituent called just the other day who imports various food products 
from Syria, because I have a large Middle Eastern community in my 
district. And just some of the challenges, they just want to go about 
life as they normally would.

I thought it was interesting. It kind of brings back home the point 
that people want to coexist peacefully. That the challenges and the 
stakes are very high in Iraq, and I think all of us want to make sure 
that whatever policy is pursued, particularly after September, it is 
one that is responsible and one that will make us all safer and 
hopefully the region more stable.

So, again, thank you, Mr. Israel, for putting this on. It is much 
appreciated.
