Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, it gives me particular 
pleasure to introduce and to yield 6 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from the Eighth District of Pennsylvania, Representative 
Patrick J. Murphy, a member of the Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence and a veteran of the Iraq war. I believe this may be his 
first legislative initiative, and we yield to him 6 minutes as we 
congratulate him for his leadership.
