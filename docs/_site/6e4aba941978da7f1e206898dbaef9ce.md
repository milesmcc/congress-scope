Mr. PERLMUTTER. What I was going to say is we are in a predicament, 
and there is a crisis of confidence, both domestically as well as 
around the world, because of so many steps that this administration has 
taken, whether it's to go into Iraq, whether it's, you know, how we 
dealt with Katrina, all of this mismanagement and unregulation or 
nonregulation or anti-regulation of the financial markets.

The good news, the good news about our country, the good news about 
America and Americans is that, with good leadership, we can do 
anything. Times of crisis are also times of opportunity. With good 
leadership, we can have this new energy economy, we can innovate, and 
we can be ingenious, and we can imagine things that will really 
transform this country and this world.

That's the kind of vision that is necessary, and we're not going to 
see that with the other side. Those are old policies. Those are old 
answers. That's the old way.
