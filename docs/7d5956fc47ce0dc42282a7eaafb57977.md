Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Sam Johnson's 
resolution. I visited this fall with a Specialist William Barth at 
Walter Reed. I got this e-mail from his father, and I talked to his 
wife Rachel this morning. They encouraged me to proceed with this.

This is Specialist William Barth. His father said:




 I wanted to thank you for visiting my son, Specialist 


 William Barth, at Walter Reed. William was injured by an IED 


 in Iraq around September 8, 2006. He since has recovered from 


 these injuries and he has been redeployed to Iraq. He is 


 heading there now.



 William is committed to his job and his fellow soldiers. He 


 could have chosen to stay stateside; however, he felt the 


 job, his job, was not finished. I have another son, Sergeant 


 Aaron Barth, who is equally committed to the cause of 


 freedom. Aaron has already served over a year in Iraq and is 


 preparing to return as well.



 Mr. Gohmert, my family is behind the President 100 percent. 


 We are committed to the cause of freedom. Keep up the good 


 work and do not allow anyone to defund the military. The next 


 time you see the President, let him know that fellow Texans 


 are praying for him, for you and for our Nation.


Now, this is support for the troops. That is what we need to be 
about, not defunding these guys fighting for us.
