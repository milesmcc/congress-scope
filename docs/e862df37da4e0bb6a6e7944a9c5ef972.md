Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, on August 4, 2008, the great Hoosier state 
lost one of its sons. Army SPC. Jonathan Menke was killed in Baghdad, 
Iraq, when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device. 
Specialist Menke was born in Columbus, Indiana, and raised in Madison, 
Indiana.

An honor roll student, Jon graduated from Madison Consolidated High 
School in 2005, where he played football and ran track. During his 
senior year, he surprised friends and family by landing the role of 
Gaston in ''Beauty and the Beast.''

Jon joined the Indiana National Guard in March 2004. In 2008, while 
living and attending college in Indianapolis, Menke was activated by 
the Indiana National Guard and sent to support Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Specialist. Menke served with the 38th Military Police Company, 
stationed in Rustamiyah, Iraq. During his tour, Specialist. Menke 
frequently asked his father to send him things for the Iraqi children--
namely shoes, toys, and candy. In Jon's mind, the needs ofthe Iraqi 
children were more important than his own comforts.

SPC Jonathan Menke is a hero and a true example of Hoosier values. 
His ultimate sacrifice deserves our most sincere thanks. I, along with 
the towns of Madison and Columbus, mourn the death of SPC Jonathan 
Menke. His friends and loved ones are in my prayers.
