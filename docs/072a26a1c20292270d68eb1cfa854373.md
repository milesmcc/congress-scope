`Mr. WARNER â€” 25 September 2007`

Mr. WARNER. I wished to reflect that my colleague, Senator McCain, is 
the distinguished ranking member.

But I put in paragraph 5, because this is a very challenging 
amendment, and I wanted to make certain that in no way did we overstep 
on the question of sovereignty. The word ''sovereignty'' is well 
described in international law and in other means as an accepted term, 
and it is well understood, so I am delighted the Senator agreed to put 
that in.

Lastly, when we look at the enormity of the sacrifices of our country 
over these many years now--most notably the tragic loss of some 3,000, 
almost 3,800 individuals and many more wounded, and expenditures of so 
much of the taxpayers' funds--the contributions of all of that has 
gotten us to where we are today. The keystone of those achievements is 
the sovereignty that has been given to the Iraqi people. That is the 
major contribution of the enormity of our sacrifice through these 
years. So in no way did we want to backstep from all of this hard-
fought ground to achieve sovereignty for the Iraqi people.

So I am delighted the Senator accepted that. Then, if we can look at 
one other paragraph, Senator, and that was on page 2, paragraph (4), 
the Senator was going to consider deleting the word ''increasing'' 
correct?
