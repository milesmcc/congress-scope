`Mr. ROBERTS â€” 14 March 2007`

Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I was just going to ask the 
distinguished Senator if he would yield. While I can't associate myself 
with all of his remarks and, as I note, the press gallery and the world 
will little note nor long remember our colloquy, perhaps, I wish to 
congratulate him for his forthrightness and his candor and his 
conviction.

The Senator and I have talked about the situation and about the need 
for full debate in regard to our national security and the war in Iraq, 
and I had hoped his resolution would be agreed to during the last--or 
the previous attempt when we only had one resolution and that was it. I 
had asked at that particular time, in a very similar situation--I was 
making a speech, and the Chamber was empty, and so I can empathize with 
that. But my comments were that we should consider the McCain amendment 
with the benchmarks, the Gregg amendment, and Senator Feingold's, 
because his is very forthright. It is very clear and very 
understandable. Now, I would not vote for it, but I respect the 
Senator's opinion, and I respect his candor.

The Senator has been a member, a valuable member of the Intelligence 
Committee. I had the privilege of being the chairman of that committee. 
I think I am the longest serving Senator on the Intelligence Committee 
up to this point--10 years. It is tough work. There are a lot of times 
I disagreed with the Senator, but the Senator is an extremely valuable 
member of the Intelligence Committee. Upon learning all of the 
intelligence from the 19 different agencies that comprise the 
community, he has developed a very strong opinion. I respect that. That 
is what we should be doing. We should be having a full debate. I hope 
in voting to proceed that we at least get that full debate.

I would say to the Senator, one of my best friends is General 
Petraeus, who used to be the commanding general at Fort Leavenworth, at 
the Intellectual Center of the Army, and he wrote the counterterrorism 
manual for the Army. He just finished it. We talked a lot about the 
British experience in regards to what happened at that particular time 
in Iraq. It is unique, it seems to me, because what the Senator wants 
to do follows the same time period General Petraeus wants to inform us 
as to whether we are making any progress and if we can achieve 
stability in Iraq, and that is a mighty big ''if.''

I think by the summer at least, if we are not making progress, at 
that particular time we are going to have to go to a policy of 
containment as opposed to intervention, as the Senator has suggested. 
How we do that, I am not quite sure. We haven't had that debate on the 
Senate floor.

Now, this Senator, Mr. Feingold, has called for that debate, and that 
is what we should be debating. It calls for a lot of different 
opinions.

So I congratulate the Senator. I thank him for his candor. I thank 
him for being forthright. I wish we could vote on the Senator's 
resolution this time around. Does the Senator think that is even 
possible?
