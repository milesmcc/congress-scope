Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, my amendment is supported by Senators 
Dorgan and Leahy, the National Guard Association, the U.S. Air Force 
Association, and the U.S. Army and Reserve Officers Association.

This is a simple amendment. Many of the men and women are coming home 
from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD and TBI. While the DOD and the 
Veterans' Administration have done a good job in providing services to 
the men and women, not everybody is accessing the services.

This amendment provides $20 million for outreach efforts so that 
State by State we can send people out to talk to them and make sure 
they understand the facilities that are there and available to them to 
help them with PTSD and TBI.

My understanding is that this amendment has been accepted. I thank 
the chairman and the ranking member.
