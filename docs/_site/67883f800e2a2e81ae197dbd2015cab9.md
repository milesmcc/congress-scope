Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, this war in Iraq has involved our National Guard and 
Reserve units to an extent that has never before been the case. And 
many of our laws simply do not reflect the new force structure that you 
see in Iraq. And that is what we, as a committee, are working to 
change. For example, the National Guard and Reserve units, even if they 
are in active duty, as they are in Iraq, are not eligible for the same 
benefits from the GI Bill as our active duty troops. We are going to 
change that. We are going to change a number of things. And I thank Mr. 
Brady, the gentleman from Philadelphia, for making sure that the Guard 
and Reserve groups have the protections in law that our active duty 
troops already have. We must protect their jobs, their credit ratings, 
and their quality of life as they are away from home in active duty 
supporting our Nation.

The laws have not kept up with this force structure. This is one of 
the ways that we're going to change that. So we're going to make sure 
that when they come home, they are recognized and not penalized for 
their active duty.
