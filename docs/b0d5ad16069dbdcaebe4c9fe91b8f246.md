Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam speaker, I would like to submit this insightful 
editorial from the Chicago Sun-Times for the record. The Sun-Times has 
accurately and incisively captured the frustrations of the residents of 
the Chicagoland area, and of Americans around the country. They are 
tired of this ill-planned and ill-executed war, and they believe that 
it is time to ''set a date to bring our troops home.''








[From the Chicago Sun-Times, July 16, 2007]


 Deadline in Iraq: It's Time To Set a Date To Bring Our Troops Home




 Americans of all political leanings want to understand when 


 our involvement in Iraq will end. We have waited patiently 


 for the positive results the president has repeatedly 


 promised. We have looked for improvements following shifts in 


 military strategy, the approval of benchmarks, the last-ditch 


 surge.



 No matter how much wishful thinking President Bush indulged 


 in last week in finding ''a cause for optimism'' in the White 


 House report on progress in Iraq, Americans heard little to 


 give them confidence that things are improving. The president 


 should face reality and put before the American people a plan 


 to conclude our direct involvement in Iraq. We need to 


 understand the end game.



 Are Iraq's political leaders any closer to resolving their 


 deep, divisive differences? Are they any closer to providing 


 security and basic services for the people? No, on both




 counts. There has been no real progress toward meeting eight 


 of 18 crucial benchmarks.



 There is, however, progress in Congress toward forcing 


 Bush's hand. The Democratic controlled House voted to require 


 the United States to withdraw most combat troops from Iraq by 


 April 1. Then two leading Republican senators, John Warner of 


 Virginia and Richard Lugar of Indiana, called for Bush to 


 present a contingency plan for Iraq to Congress by Oct. 16.



 Threatened with opposition from more Republicans, the 


 president is pulling out all political stops to keep ahead of 


 that trend. At his worst, he has resorted to recycling cheap 


 scare tactics--warning that the terrorist threat to 


 Americans, on American soil, will increase dramatically the 


 minute we pull soldiers from Iraq.



 In lashing Congress for trying to ''run the war,'' Bush 


 might have been lashing Americans who expressed their ardent 


 opposition to the war at the polls last November. He wants us 


 to wait until Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker 


 release their progress report on Iraq in September before 


 reaching any conclusions. Our concern is if their findings 


 don't jibe with his policy, the president will come up with 


 more reasons for Americans to withhold judgment. To wait some 


 more.



 Some have argued that setting a deadline will give the 


 enemy a target date, allowing the enemy to lie in wait. But 


 not having a plan risks further inciting Americans against 


 the war. It could lead an exasperated Congress to make rash 


 ultimatums that would put soldiers more at risk than if the 


 president initiated a rational plan now.



 The president has had more than enough time to develop and 


 articulate an exit strategy in Iraq. Everyone wants to 


 minimize the mess we'll leave behind. If April 1 doesn't work 


 for the president, what date will? How long does he envision 


 that we'll have to stay? The answer can no longer be 


 ''indefinitely.'' The American people need a plan, and they 


 need it now.
