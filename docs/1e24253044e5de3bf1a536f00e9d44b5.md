Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, simply put, I strongly oppose 
this war and have done so since its inception.

I stand ready to do whatever needs to be done to bring this conflict 
to a responsible end--and I have been working toward that goal since 
the first day I stepped onto this floor.

As a Progressive, my first inclination was to vote against this 
supplemental.

I still believe it's important to loudly proclaim that this war 
should end, but I've come to the conclusion that a vote against this 
bill is not the most effective way to make that statement.

Even though this supplemental does not push for an immediate end, it 
is our best hope in the Progressive struggle to bring our troops home 
and finally allow the Iraqis to determine their own future.

I am also strongly supportive of the funds provided in this bill to 
fund the S-CHIP shortfall.

Georgia's PeachCare program needs immediate relief and this bill will 
ensure children in need in my state continue to receive the health 
insurance we promised them, at least for the short term.

Make no mistake, I do not consider this bill to be the final 
statement on the war in Iraq--or the PeachCare program for that matter. 
But it is a good start and I will support it today.
