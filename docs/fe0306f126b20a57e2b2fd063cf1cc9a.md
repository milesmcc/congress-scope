Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Chairman Obey and 
Chairman Murtha.

As a solemn and distinguished body, we again stand ready to break 
with President Bush and demand change in Iraq. And again, we have a 
chance to do what is right after years of pursuing the wrong strategy, 
a misguided strategy, that I saw firsthand and a battle my fellow 
paratroopers are still fighting today.

Today, we can come together to do what is right. Today, we can change 
direction in Iraq, refocus on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and give our 
troops the GI Bill that they have earned.

The question before us is clear: Do we proceed in a bipartisan way 
with the support of military experts and American families? Or do we 
continue to allow more political posturing and more of the same while 
American troops are stuck refereeing a religious civil war?

That is the choice we all must make. And to those who stand in the 
way of change and accountability in Iraq, the American people are 
paying attention.
