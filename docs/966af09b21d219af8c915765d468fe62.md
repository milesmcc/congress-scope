Mr. McCAUL. Precisely. And what came out in a shocking story that has 
not been told enough, in my view, was that FBI agents were there at the 
detention facilities reading them the Miranda rights. This is where 
this administration has shifted towards treating them as criminal 
defendants in Afghanistan, with full rights of the U.S. Constitution in 
Afghanistan. And I believe it is a sad day for America when we bring 
this mastermind of 9/11 to the very city where he killed 3,000 
Americans.
