`Mr. PATRICK MURPHY of Pennsylvania â€” 22 January 2007`

Mr. PATRICK MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Arkansas for this opportunity and for allowing me to 
serve on that task force that we formed to present this bill this week, 
this Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability resolution.

As I was seeking to prepare my remarks, I could not help but think 
about Mr. Scott from the great State of Georgia when he talked about 
that Constitution. That is the Constitution that every soldier, every 
airmen, every marine takes note to support and defend against all 
enemies, foreign and domestic. I appreciate that.

That is the Constitution I had the great opportunity to talk about 
and teach about every single day at the United States Military Academy 
at West Point, and talking about those first three articles of our 
Constitution that lays out the framework, that separation of powers 
that we talk about. There is a reason why Article I was the Congress 
and Article II was the President and Article III was the judiciary.

Those two main goals of the U.S. Congress is to, one, declare war; 
but two is the purse strings, that budget that you talked so eloquently 
about. So I appreciate you bringing that up, and I hope we can make 
this happen this week. I do believe that we will get many of our 
colleagues, not just on our side of the aisle, but also on the other 
side of the Chamber as well.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the war in Iraq, and I want 
to talk today because the Blue Dogs, the Blue Dog Democrats, the 
fiscally conservative Democrats, stay focused on two things: one, 
fiscal responsibility; and, two, a strong national defense. The 
legislation that we are discussing this week, which I will have the 
opportunity to introduce, tackles both of these issues.

Mr. Speaker, we have spent over $360 billion in Iraq over the course 
of the last 4 years.



Along with the casualty reports and the terrible news on the ground, 
we are getting reports about money lost and weapons missing.

Last week, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, we heard from 
Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraqi reconstruction. 
He told those of us at the hearing that as much as 15 percent of the 
billions of dollars that we were spending in Iraq has vanished, and as 
many as 14,000 weapons sent to the Iraqis have gone missing because of 
mismanagement and fraud. That is enough weaponry to arm an entire 
division of the al Sadr militia. This isn't just about money; it is 
about the safety of our troops as well.

Mr. Speaker, it is long past time that we kept track of the money and 
the weapons that we are giving to the Iraqis and to replace the fraud, 
waste and abuse with proper oversight, responsibility and 
accountability.

The legislation that the Blue Dogs are introducing this week 
addresses the glaring lack of oversight and accountability in Iraq and 
addresses how our taxpayer dollars are spent on the war. It puts 
forward commonsense proposals that ensure fewer resources are wasted 
and more resources get to the troops in the field.

This bill contains measures everyone can agree on, regardless of 
their political party. American families are frustrated with the war in 
Iraq, and this legislation will go a long way toward providing some 
meaningful solutions.

Another thing that this legislation does is urge the establishment of 
a Truman Committee-type commission to track and curb the waste, fraud 
and abuse in Iraq. In the 1940s, then-Senator Harry Truman established 
a committee that wasn't very popular at the time. Senator Truman's work 
reportedly saved $11 billion, and eventually landed him on the cover of 
Time magazine.

Now, Mr. Speaker, none of us here, none of us Blue Dogs here, are 
looking to be on the front of a magazine cover; but we are looking for 
an end to the mismanagement in Iraq and in the war.

As you know, this issue hits very close to home for me. I served in 
Baghdad, Iraq, in 2003 to 2004 as a member of the 82nd Airborne 
Division, Second Brigade Combat Team. On our team, we lost 19 men, men 
that made the ultimate sacrifice. Part of what we did in Iraq was to 
train the Iraqi National Defense Corps.

At the time that we were training them back in that summer of 2003, 
they didn't have uniforms, so we took the initiative to give them hats, 
Chicago White Sox hats, so that we could identify them as a unit. They 
didn't have uniforms. There was no oversight. There was no thought 
process. But our soldiers on the ground took the initiative to at least 
give them something that would distinguish them.

At our hearing, Special Inspector Bowen revealed one example of $75 
million so grossly mismanaged by the Iraqi Police Academy that it had 
to be knocked down before it was even put to use. That is $75 million 
in American taxpayer money that is just thrown to the wayside.

Mr. Speaker, it is time for answers, and it is time for 
accountability.
