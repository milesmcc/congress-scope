Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, today I honor the service of one of 
our nation's brave soldiers, Specialist David Oliver. Spc. Oliver was 
severely injured in Afghanistan during operation Enduring Freedom and 
is currently undergoing a lengthy rehabilitation at Walter Reed Medical 
Center here in D.C.

A graduate of Casa Roble High School, Specialist Oliver enlisted in 
the Army immediately upon graduation eager to serve his country and 
continue his family's tradition of service--David's father was a 
firefighter in Sacramento County, his brother serves in the Marines and 
his sister in the Air Force. After enlisting, Specialist Oliver was 
deployed to Iraq and upon completion of his assignment there he 
volunteered to serve in Afghanistan where he suffered his wounds.

I am extremely humbled to know there are men and women of his caliber 
who are so willing to risk their lives in order to protect our great 
country. I consider it a great honor and privilege to represent 
Specialist David Oliver and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing his great service and sacrifice.
