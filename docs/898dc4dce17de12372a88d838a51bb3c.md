Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and honor the life and service of Marine Corporal Kevin Cueto 
of San Jose, California, who was killed in action on June 24, 2010, in 
the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. He was 23 years old.

Kevin was born in Santa Clara County, and grew up in San Jose, moving 
to Campbell while in high school to live with his dad. At Westmont High 
School, Kevin was a member of the football, baseball, and wrestling 
teams, as well as the Reserve Officers Training Corps. Following high 
school, determined to serve his country and his family, Kevin enlisted 
in the Marines, and was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine 
Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Marine Expeditionary Force, based in 
Twentynine Palms, California. Corporal Cueto served a tour in Iraq in 
2009 before being deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year. Last week, 
he was tragically killed when his patrol was struck by a roadside bomb 
while conducting combat operations. His awards and decorations include 
the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the 
National Defense Service Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service 
Medal.

Corporal Cueto leaves behind his parents and a younger brother. I 
extend my sincerest gratitude to him and my condolences to his family. 
I ask every


Member of the House to join me in honoring his service to our country.
