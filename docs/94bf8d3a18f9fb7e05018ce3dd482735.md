`Mr. CONAWAY â€” 19 March 2007`

Mr. CONAWAY. I appreciate my colleague's comment. This war, this 
fight has been compared with Vietnam. I think it is a lousy comparison. 
I think it is flawed on every level. But if we look at what happened 
when America withdrew, under Democratic leadership, withdrew, 
Democratic House, withdrew from Vietnam, look what happened to the 
people of Vietnam, the boat people exodus, the death inside Vietnam, 
and then the spillover into Cambodia with Pol Pot, 2 million lives lost 
under that ripple effect.

But the one thing that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
have yet to answer, in addition to how do you face that mom and dad as 
a part of this artificial deadline, how do you manage the disaster in 
Iraq if we did pull out tonight, if we did get our guys out of there? 
The regional fight, the spillover into other countries, the 
humanitarian suffering on an incredible scale, how do, in fact, we 
manage that disaster if your answer is that we have to get out of Iraq 
tonight?
