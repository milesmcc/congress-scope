`Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania â€” 12 July 2007`

---


Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the sixth 
time, I rise calling for a change of direction in Iraq. For the sixth 
time, I call on the President to stop sending our brave men and women 
to referee a religious civil war. For the sixth time I call on this 
administration to focus our efforts in fighting the central front on 
the war on terror by killing Osama bin Laden and destroying al Qaeda in 
Afghanistan.

Mr. Speaker, last week countless folks back in Pennsylvania stopped 
me and asked, Aren't you frustrated by this President who refuses to 
listen to Congress and the American people?

I told them, I am frustrated that our President refuses to follow the 
advice of military experts and the will of the American people. I am 
frustrated because my fellow paratroopers are still fighting and dying 
in the 138-degree heat of a Baghdad summer. I told them that I will 
refuse to stop fighting for the best policy for our troops and our 
families back here at home.

Mr. Speaker, leaving our troops in the middle of a religious civil 
war isn't resolute. It's reckless. No question that change is slow, but 
take heart, America. Change is coming. Congress is not going to stop.

President Bush, the legislative branch of government is back and we 
are not going to go away. We will change the course in Iraq and fight 
for a smarter global war on terror.

Some Republicans have questioned the patriotism of my fellow 
Democrats. Even former soldiers here in the House floor. But those 
types of Republicans are the exception and not the rule. In my short 
time in Congress, I have learned that most of my colleagues across the 
aisle are good, decent, and patriotic Americans. Mr. Speaker, I know 
how much pressure my friends across the aisle are under from the 
President, from their party leaders to just stay the course.

But I ask you as a soldier, as a father, and as a colleague to 
acknowledge what the status quo entails. That means additional 
warnings, walking to our desks here in the Halls of Congress, holding 
our breath and hoping we don't get word of another fallen soldier.

Mr. Speaker, I implore my Republican colleagues who know in their 
heart that we need a change. I implore you to think about how many more 
of these calls you have to make, how many more calls to wives, to 
fathers, to mothers we all will be forced to make if we don't take 
action.

I have heard the other side say 4 more months. This President has had 
his 4 months. He has had his 4 years and 4 months. In 2004, the 
President said we are turning the corner. In 2005, the Vice President 
said the insurgency was in its last throes. In 2006, that was the year 
in transition. And now in 2007, the President says just be patient.

In the last month alone in Bucks County, we have buried four of our 
finest sons. Four names have been added to the memorial board outside 
my office. I, for one, don't want to add any more names.

My Republican colleagues, you have the power today to stop these 
tragic phone calls, to stop adding faces and names to our memorials. 
Let's change the direction in Iraq and get back to fighting a smarter 
war on terror together, not as Democrats and Republicans, but as 
Americans.
