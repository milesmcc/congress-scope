# THE UNGRATEFUL NATION?

Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, as we begin the debate on Iraq today, I have 
received input from Brian in Humble, Texas. He says, ''I am a veteran 
of Vietnam. My father is a veteran of World War II, Korea and Vietnam. 
I have four brothers that are veterans, and my oldest son is serving 
his fourth tour of duty in Iraq. If winning in Iraq takes more 
resources, it is far better than the alternatives. You owe the young 
men and women, and yes, my son in harm's way, your total support.''

The cost of our security does not come without a price. The 
alternatives, the loss of American freedoms and security and leaving 
Iraq before our duty is done, is not the option. If more troops are 
needed, then it is our duty to supply them.

What message does this Nation send its heroes deep within the belly 
of combat to tell them no troops are coming to their aid? This leaves 
those left behind stranded without the resources in front of a deadly 
enemy.

Mr. Speaker, the words of this veteran, whose family holds a proud 
history of service to America, are wise words. This Nation owes its 
gratitude and support to its U.S. soldiers fighting to protect our 
interests; otherwise, we will be judged to be the ungrateful Nation.

And that's just the way it is.
