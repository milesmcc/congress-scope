`Ms. NORTON â€” 22 March 2007`

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.

Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me 
his time.

Madam Speaker, this bill is covered with the full handprints of 
scores of Members, beginning on the other side of the aisle with 
Congressman Tom Davis, who planted and tirelessly cultivated the seed; 
and Utah Members Cannon and Bishop, joined by Mr. Matheson, the State's 
only Democratic Member.

However, it was leadership that got us to this historic day, 
especially Speaker Pelosi's personal insistence, Majority Leader 
Hoyer's outspoken energy, Chairman Conyers' decades of persistence and 
Chairman Waxman's indispensable guidance.

I am inspired daily by the citizens of this city, personified by 
Emory Kosh, a staff assistant in my office here in the House whose 
second child was born while he was serving in Iraq. Emory's military 
service follows in the tradition of D.C. residents, who first fought in 
the Revolutionary War to establish ''the Republic for which we stand,'' 
have fought and died for their country in every war since, and, like 
other Americans, have always been obliged to pay Federal income taxes, 
today ranking second among the 50 States and the District of Columbia 
in taxes paid to support the Government of the United States. Today, I 
come forward in their name.

Our forefathers in this city were the three Virginians who signed the 
Constitution and the three signers from Maryland. Yet some seriously 
argue that the Virginians, the Marylanders and the other Framers fresh 
from the Revolutionary War, waged specifically to obtain 
representation, contributed land where thousands of their own residents 
resided, some of them veterans of the Revolutionary War, and then 
signed away their rights in the new Constitution.

However you vote on the District's voting rights, do not slander the 
Framers. For two centuries, the fault has been right here in the 
Congress, not the flawed vision of the Framers.



Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
