Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of our veterans who have served our country valiantly 
throughout our history.

As we approach Memorial Day, we find ourselves in the middle of wars 
in both Iraq and Afghanistan--wars which continue to produce more 
veterans every day.

Today's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are different from others in our 
history.

In today's wars, insurgents launch unconventional, horrific attacks 
on our troops, using devices like IED's--leaving some of our troops 
requiring ongoing special medical attention.

It is critical that we provide our veterans with the care they need 
and deserve in return for their bravery and sacrifice.

When I host military mothers this week, in my district in Orange 
County, California, I will thank them for their sacrifices, but I will 
also assure them that Congress will do all we can to take care of their 
children.

I thank all of our Nation's veterans for their bravery, their 
service, and their sacrifice.
