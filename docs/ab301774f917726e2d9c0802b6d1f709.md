Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, when we as a Nation talk about our 
priorities, it is often useful to use numbers to put things in 
perspective. So today let's think about the number 10. On Thursday, 
this House will have the opportunity to override a Presidential veto 
that would allow us to ensure 10 million children have access to 
quality health care so that they can see the doctor of their choice 
when they need to. We realize the importance of preventive care. 
Children shouldn't be forced to let a cold or earache linger until it 
reaches emergency proportions.

President Bush says our bipartisan compromise is too expensive. But 
while we are working to ensure 10 million children have access to 
health care, President Bush has no problem asking us to send $10 
billion every month to Iraq.

Madam Speaker, this is a debate about priorities. House Republicans 
should join us in overriding the President's veto to send a message 
that children's health care is a priority of this House.
