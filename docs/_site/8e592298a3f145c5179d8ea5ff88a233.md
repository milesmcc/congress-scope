Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, let me take this means to recognize the 
outstanding military service and contributions to our country of Rear 
Admiral (Sel) Earl Lenell Gay, U.S. Navy, on the occasion of his 
completion of assignment as Director, Navy Congressional Liaison, U.S. 
House of Representatives.

A native of Atlanta, GA, RADM (Sel) Earl Gay is a 1980 graduate of 
the U.S. Naval Academy. After attending flight school, he earned his 
pilot wings of gold in 1981. During several tours, he commanded a fleet 
operational helicopter squadron and the Fleet Training Squadron for all 
SH-60 aircraft. Selected to major command, he served as Commanding 
Officer of the Amphibious Assault Carrier, USS Belleau Wood (LHA 3) 
from March 2003 to October 2004, participating in combat support 
operations during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Rear Admiral (Sel) Gay was selected to serve as Director, Navy House 
Liaison in December 2004. In this highly visible tour, he assisted in 
the passage of critical Navy budget legislation during the 108th, 
109th, and 110th Congresses. Additionally, he planned and led 29 
Congressional Delegations (CODELs) across the globe that included 
meetings with various world leaders in support of America's national 
security policy. His counsel to me and other Members of the House has 
proved invaluable in articulating the Navy's vision to Congress.

Please join me and our colleagues in thanking Rear Admiral (Sel) Gay 
and his family for their tireless contributions to a grateful Nation 
and in wishing them the best in their future.
