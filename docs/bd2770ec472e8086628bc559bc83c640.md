Mr. PUTNAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant First Class 
Quinton Edward Courson, Jr.

At an awards ceremony held May 16, 2008 at Fort Bragg, North 
Carolina, Sergeant First Class Quinton Edward Courson, Jr., a 1990 
graduate of Bartow High School, was awarded the Bronze Star medal for 
his actions during a recent fifteen month tour of duty with the United 
States Army in Tikrit, Iraq. The medal is added to those previously 
earned by SFC Courson, which include the Combat Action Badge, Parachute 
Qualifications Badge, four Army Commendation medals, six Army 
Achievement medals and numerous service medals awarded for service in 
Korea, the Sinai Peninsula and two deployments to Iraq while serving 
with the 75th Ranger Regiment and the 82nd Airborne Division.

SFC Courson has served seventeen years in the U.S. Army, four years 
of which have been outside the United States. Quinn and his two 
daughters, Whitney and Kortney currently live in Springhill, North 
Carolina until July 2008, when he is reassigned as an instructor at the 
Advanced Individual Training School at Fort Lee, Virginia.

The ceremony was attended by his Mother, Debbie Parrish of Alturas, 
Florida and other family members.

I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring not only the contributions 
and accomplishments of SFC Courson, but all the men and women serving 
in the Armed Forces. America is truly a great place because of those 
who proudly serve this great Nation.
