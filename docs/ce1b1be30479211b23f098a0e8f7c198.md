`Mr. FORBES â€” 3 October 2007`

Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Chairman, once again we hear the intent, but why in the world 
we would want to reduce the current jurisdiction that we have, which is 
what we see reflected in this piece of legislation that could have been 
corrected, still is beyond me. If we have a contractor who is having 
employees doing illegal acts in a base in Germany in a mission for DOD, 
we would want to prosecute them every bit as much as we would if they 
were in Iraq. Why we want to reduce that, I just don't understand.

Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut 
(Mr. Shays).
