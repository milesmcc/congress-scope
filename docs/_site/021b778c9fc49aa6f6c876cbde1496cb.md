`Mr. ROBERTS â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I just wanted to make it clear to myself 
and others what we are facing here; that is, there would be only one 
vote we would have on the resolution that was passed in the House, 
which I feel I could not vote for because it is nonbinding--it is, 
again, to support the troops but not the mission, which I think is 
certainly unique in regards to how people feel about this--and that, 
basically, the McCain resolution, which I support, which sets out the 
benchmarks to give to General Petraeus and to give to Prime Minister 
Maliki to gain some kind of catalyst or effort that would say: Look, 
this is where the Senate stands, and hopefully we can get these things 
done so that we can see some progress, to see if it is possible to 
achieve some security in Iraq and give that Government a political 
settlement. And the second amendment I am talking about is the one of 
Senator Gregg, as I understand it.
