Mr. PASCRELL. It is not surprising to learn that during the Scooter 
Libby trial, Vice President Cheney's former communications aide, 
Catherine Martin, said that delivering a message on Meet the Press was 
a tactic we often use. By the way, within the last 10 minutes, Mr. 
Libby has been found guilty on four of five counts.

The truth shall lead America. The truth is that the 9/11 Commission 
found no credible evidence of a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda and the 
attacks upon the United States. The epicenter of our war against terror 
is not Iraq but on the border of Pakistan and on the border of 
Afghanistan.

The American people deserve the truth instead of deceptive tactics. 
And if this administration won't give the people the truth about this 
war, then this Congress will.

He stated, Mr. Cheney, five separate occasions that Saddam Hussein 
was joined at the hip with bin Laden. He told the American people five 
times a lie and repeated it year after year on the same TV station. The 
epicenter of our war on terror is on the border of Afghanistan and 
Pakistan.
