`Ms. PELOSI â€” 16 October 2007`

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for 
yielding, and I appreciate his strong leadership in protecting and 
defending the Constitution of the United States. He leads us well in 
honoring our oath of office that we take.

I commend the cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation, Mr. Boucher 
and Mr. Pence, for their leadership and commitment to working in a 
bipartisan way on an issue central to our democracy.

Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ''Our liberty depends on the freedom of 
the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.'' Freedom of 
the press, protected by the first amendment, has been a cornerstone of 
our democracy, one that we cherish and promote around the world.

A free press keeps our Nation informed and holds those of us in 
government accountable. It is critical to freedom of speech and 
expression in our country. Freedom of the press is fundamental to our 
democracy and it is fundamental to our security.

Speaking truth to power is vital to our democracy today, as it has 
been throughout our history.

Mr. Speaker, the recent contracting scandals in Iraq, the appalling 
care of our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital, and the hidden 
Medicare drug prescription estimates a few years ago are several of the 
many examples where press coverage shaped our debate and our actions. 
These stories are central to accountability, the accountability 
necessary to make our Nation stronger and to be better stewards of the 
taxpayers' dollars.

However, the essential work of the press has been severely hampered 
by the lack of a consistent Federal standard or a federally recognized 
privilege concerning the disclosure of confidential sources by 
journalists. As a result, in recent years, more than 40 reporters have 
been subpoenaed for the identities of confidential sources in nearly a 
dozen cases.

Former Solicitor General Ted Olson, who served under President George 
W. Bush, wrote recently in The Washington Post, ''Journalists reporting 
on high-profile controversies cannot function effectively without 
offering some measure of confidentiality to their sources. Their 
ability to do so yields substantial benefits to the public in the form 
of stories that might otherwise never be written about corruption and 
abuse of power.''

Nearly all States have some form of press shield protecting the 
confidentiality of journalist sources; however, that protection is 
lacking at the Federal level and in the Federal courts.

It is for this reason that I have long supported a Federal press 
shield law, without which freedom of the press is threatened. The 
Federal Government's policies and actions should protect and preserve 
the press's ability to speak


truth to power. And this legislation does so with appropriate national 
security safeguards, striking a careful balance between liberty and 
security.

Freedom of the press has long been an issue of importance to many of 
us in this body. When I was the ranking member of the Intelligence 
Committee, I encouraged President Clinton to veto the Intelligence 
Committee authorization bill one year because it made it easier to 
prosecute journalists. We fixed those provisions and passed a bill that 
both protected our Nation and protected our fundamental freedoms.

Mr. Speaker, we seek today to protect the freedom of the press that 
has served our Nation so well. We also seek to make clear to 
confidential sources that they will be protected in most circumstances 
when they bring forward public evidence of waste, fraud and abuse in 
government and in the private sector.

As we protect and defend our Nation, we must now protect and defend 
the Constitution by enabling our press to be free, as our Founders 
envisioned.

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
