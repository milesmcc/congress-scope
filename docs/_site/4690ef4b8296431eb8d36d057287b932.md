Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

As the gentleman knows, our number one priority has been and 
continues to be the progress on the creation of jobs. Last month's 
report was a positive report. We gained 162,000 jobs, and the economy 
is showing signs of very substantial improvement as a result of the 
Recovery Act and of other actions that we've taken to get Americans 
back to work. So that will continue to be our focus.

Having said that, we also have passed already the HIRE Act, which we 
think


will have a very substantial, positive effect, which includes payroll 
tax forgiveness for the hiring of new employees who have been 
unemployed for some period of time. If they are kept on for 52 weeks, 
there will be a $1,000 additional payment, which we hope will encourage 
employers to hire new people. Additionally in that bill, we gave an 
extension of the Highway Trust Fund to allow for continued and 
increased investment in infrastructure and the Build America Bonds 
legislation, as well as giving a boost to small business growth in 
terms of expensing.

In addition, the House passed the Small Business and Infrastructure 
Jobs Act, which is pending in the Senate. We hope that it is coming 
back to us this work period. We would like to build on our record of 
job-creating legislation with additional relief to small businesses.

The President has proposed, as the gentleman knows, the Small 
Business Lending Fund that would take $30 billion of TARP funds, which 
was obviously designed to try to get our economy moving again, and 
provide capital infusion to local banks, and provide assets of $10 
billion or less to incentivize small business lending.

Also, we hope to complete action with the Senate on a long-term 
extension of unemployment insurance, COBRA benefits and tax extenders 
for businesses, large and small. Obviously, those pieces of legislation 
have passed the House.

I expect the House will also take action this work period on the 
COMPETES Act, which is relatively noncontroversial, but invests in 
growing our economy, particularly in technology innovations, math, and 
science.

Other items on our agenda for this work period are budget resolution, 
defense acquisition reform, which I announced we would do next week, 
defense authorization, the Afghanistan/Pakistan supplemental, the Haiti 
supplemental, and of course the Iran sanctions conference report, which 
I hope to have done. As to the resolution that you and I just voted 
for, the motion to instruct, I urge that that be reported back by the 
Memorial Day break.
