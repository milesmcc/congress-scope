Mrs. JO ANN DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, due to medical reasons, I 
will be unable to vote on the conference report on H.R. 1591, the U.S. 
Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq 
Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007. However, if I had been in 
Washington, D.C. for the vote, I would have opposed this measure.

I believe that Congress is making a mistake with these attempts to 
substitute the judgment of military commanders in theater with the 
micromanaging of politicians in Washington.

Furthermore, I do not believe that setting artificial timetables for 
withdrawal of our forces from Iraq is in the best interests of our 
country or our military. While there have been mistakes made in Iraq, I 
believe that enacting this bill into law would have dangerous 
consequences for our Nation, Iraq, and the Middle East.

The Iraqi government continues to need our strong support as they 
rebuild their country, and this legislation would turn our backs on 
that country in its time of need.
