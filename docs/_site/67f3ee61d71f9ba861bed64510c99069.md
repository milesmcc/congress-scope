Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, in the Fourth Congressional 
District of Georgia, there are many individuals who are called to 
contribute to the needs of our community through leadership and 
service.

Jamaal Rashard Addison was born on October 7, 1980 and began his 
education in the DeKalb County Educational School system and graduated 
from Lakeside High School with honors.

Jamaal Rashard Addison enlisted in the United States Army on March 1, 
2000 and faithfully served this country until March 23, 2003, when he 
became Georgia's first fallen soldier in the Iraq war.

This remarkable young man gave of himself, his time, his talent, and 
his life.

Jamaal Rashard Addison was a soldier, a warrior, a father, a son, a 
brother and a friend.

I was pleased to set aside April 28, 2007 to honor and recognize 
Jamaal Rashard Addison for his leadership and service to our country.
