Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 2206, the ''U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, Katrina 
Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Act.'' This legislation includes the 
important funding that has already passed this chamber to provide 
resources for servicemen and women, for military and veterans' health 
care, and for valuable programs like LIHEAP and SCHIP.

This bill ensures accountability. H.R. 2206 provides 3 months of 
funding for the war in Iraq but requires the president to report back 
to Congress about whether certain goals are met before the rest of the 
funds will be released by subsequent legislation.

It is time for the president to listen to the American people and 
support this reasonable legislation to help bring an end to this war.
