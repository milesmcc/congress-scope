`Mr. BAYH â€” 17 May 2010`

Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Marine LT 
Brandon Barrett from Marion, IN. Brandon was only 27 years old when he 
lost his life on May 5 while serving bravely in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Lieutenant Barrett was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 6th Marine 
Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp 
Lejeune.

Today, I join family and friends in mourning his death who will 
forever remember him as a loving son, brother, and friend. He is 
survived by his mother, Cindy Barrett, his father, Brett Barrett, his 
sisters, Ashley and Taylor Barrett and his brother, Brock Barrett.

Brandon was a native of Marion. Prior to entering the Marine Corps in 
2006, Brandon graduated from Marion High School and attended the U.S. 
Naval Academy. His family and friends describe him as a bright student, 
a gifted football and baseball star, and a proud Hoosier who 
courageously refused to take freedom for granted.

Brandon was deployed on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. 
During his service, Brandon earned an array of awards, including the 
Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, National Defense Service 
Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign 
Medal and NATO International Security Assistance Force Medal.

While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we take pride 
in the example of this American hero. We cherish the legacy of his 
service and his life.

As I search for words to honor this fallen Marine, I recall President 
Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: ''We 
cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. 
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated 
it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little 
note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what 
they did here.''

It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brandon Barrett in the Record 
of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and for his profound 
commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace.

I pray that Brandon's family finds comfort in the words of the 
prophet Isaiah who said, ''He will swallow up death in victory; and the 
Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''
