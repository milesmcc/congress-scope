Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, I have no problem with the rule. I 
do have a problem with the underlying bill, which provides the 
President with another blank check in support of his Iraq war policy, 
but I stated I think very clearly my concerns about that.

Other than a few closing remarks, I am going to reserve my time.
