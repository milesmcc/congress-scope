Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, seven brave Americans were 
killed in the line of duty on December 30, 2009, in Khost, Afghanistan.

On that day, we lost good and honorable public servants, whose 
contributions to our national security will be dearly missed. We lost 
productive citizens--loving parents, siblings, children of Americans 
who will never see their loved ones again.

We honor their records of service and their sacrifice. We honor their 
willingness to serve our country during turbulent and dangerous times.

I extend on behalf of my constituents sincerest condolences to the 
families of those who have died.

Nothing we say here can heal the wounds of those who loved them. But 
decisions we make here can ensure that their lives were not lost in 
vain.
