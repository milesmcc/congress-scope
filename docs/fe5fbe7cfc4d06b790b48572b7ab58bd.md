Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a young 
man from the First Congressional District of Alabama who recently made 
the ultimate sacrifice in defense of his country while helping to 
spread freedom abroad.

Army Staff Sgt. Harrison Brown, formerly of Prichard, was assigned to 
the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd 
Infantry Division, based at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was killed in 
combat earlier this month while bravely serving and protecting this 
great nation in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

''Duck,'' as he was known to his friends, joined the Army 13 years 
ago to provide for his wife and children. During his career in the 
Army, including multiple tours of duty in Iraq, Sgt. Brown set a 
standard of excellence and displayed the qualities of discipline, 
devotion, and dedication to country that are the hallmarks of men and 
women throughout the long and distinguished history of the American 
military.

A 1994 graduate of Blount High School, ''Duck'' played baseball and 
basketball and was a standout wide receiver on the varsity football 
team. Blount won the state 5A high school football championship while 
''Duck'' was on the team. He went on to play one year of college 
football at Tuskegee University on scholarship before he joined the 
Army.

Madam Speaker, at this difficult time, it is only appropriate for us 
to pause and give thanks to God that there are still young men like 
Harrison Brown. His life and actions personify the very best America 
has to offer. I feel certain his many friends and family, as well as 
his comrades in the United States Army, while mourning the loss of this 
fine young man, are also taking this opportunity to remember his many 
accomplishments and to recall the fine gift they each received simply 
from knowing him and having him as an integral part of their lives.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take a moment and pay tribute 
to Sgt. Harrison Brown and his selfless devotion to not only our 
country and the freedom we enjoy, but to a people who are in the 
demanding but important stages of a new life--a new freedom--in their 
own land.

We should also remember his wife, Delisha Brown; their three 
children; his mother, Chris Ann Brown; his sister, Mary Dozier; and his 
other relatives and many friends. Our prayer is that God will give them 
all the strength and courage that only He can provide to sustain them 
during the difficult days ahead.

It was Joseph Campbell who said, ''A hero is someone who has given 
his or her life to something bigger than oneself.''



Make no mistake, Harrison Brown was not only a dedicated soldier who 
made the ultimate sacrifice serving in the uniform of his country, but 
he was also a true American hero. May he rest in peace.
