Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. The House should stop playing politics 
with troop funding. The money is being held up by liberal lawmakers so 
they can add billions of dollars to the so-called ''stimulus'' funds 
and special interest moneys to the troop funding package.

Partisan special interest moneys and a hodgepodge of wasteful 
spending has no place in a true funding bill. We need a clean bill that 
will pass easily so our military operations will not be disrupted. 
Secretary Gates has warned us not to hold up this essential spending or 
else defense spending will suffer, meaning our troops will be at risk.

As a veteran with four sons in the military, nothing is more 
important to me than making sure our troops on the front lines receive 
the funding they need. With two counterinsurgency operations going on 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, it's highly irresponsible to hold this up any 
longer.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th in the global war on terrorism.
