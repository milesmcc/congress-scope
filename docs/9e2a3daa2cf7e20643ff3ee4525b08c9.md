Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, my concern that the President might 
launch a military strike against Iran is well known; but my mission 
here today is not rhetorical. I am here to propose that Members of 
Congress participate in an Iran war game.

Television could carry the event so the American people can watch it 
all. We know that the Pentagon has conducted war games to examine the 
casualties and consequences of a U.S. military strike against Iran. We 
should, too.

Here are some of the questions that could be answered: Could we use 
bunker buster bombs? Could a U.S. military strike against Iran result 
in a wider Middle East war? What provocation would cause the President 
to provoke such a strike?

A group of retired, high-level CIA agents brought this idea to me. 
These are patriots whom we trusted with keeping and protecting 
America's secrets. They and others, including a retired Air Force 
colonel who conducted war games in the Pentagon, would accurately 
produce a U.S.-Iran war game just as it is done in the Pentagon. I know 
because they gave me the plan.

A military strike against Iran would involve life-and-death issues. 
We need to understand what they would look like. I urge my colleagues 
and the media to join me in demanding that we publicly conduct a U.S.-
Iran war game as soon as possible.

Think what we would have learned if we had done it before Iraq.
