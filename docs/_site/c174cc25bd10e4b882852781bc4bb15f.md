Mr. REID. Mr. President, in my office a few minutes ago, I received a 
call from Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I 
wrote down what he asked and what he said. He said: Senator, there is a 
sense of urgency that General McChrystal be able to go to Afghanistan 
tonight.

There is no commander in Afghanistan.

Admiral Mullen said--and I wrote it down: Admiral McChrystal is 
literally waiting by an airplane. It is 2 o'clock in the morning 
Thursday in Afghanistan. Dawn will soon be breaking and our troops will 
not have a commander there.

Is this what the minority wants? Why can't they come and approve this 
man to go defend us in Afghanistan? I am without words to try to 
explain my consternation at the fact that General McChrystal, one of 
our most eminent, prominent, outstanding, qualified soldiers, a man 
whose father won five Silver Stars, a man whose record is one of being 
the leading person in our military to do counterinsurgency--that is 
what he is an expert in doing.

Let's get the man approved tonight so he can leave in an airplane and 
get over there and take care of his men and women.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.
