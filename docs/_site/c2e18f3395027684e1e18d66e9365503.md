Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, President Bush said last week 
al Qaeda in Iraq attacked us on 9/11.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is there was no al 
Qaeda in Iraq on 9/11. In fact, we helped create al Qaeda in Iraq by 
our invasion. And what we are going to learn today from our 
intelligence service report is 4 years in Iraq has made al Qaeda 
stronger around the world.

So let's get our facts straight in this war and focus on the real 
threat in a smart and intelligent way.
