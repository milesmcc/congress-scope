Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of course the bill is not being held 
up, and of course the majority does not need permission from us to take 
up the bill. Today we will, in fact, vote on the cloture motion to 
proceed to the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. It is my 
belief cloture should be invoked and will be invoked.

There is actually much to commend in this bill. It will improve the 
lives of our veterans by supplementing the level of assistance for 
disabled veterans for the purchase of automobiles and increasing 
assistance for those veterans who need to modify their homes to 
accommodate their disabilities.

I wish to recognize with admiration my colleague from North Carolina, 
the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and thank him 
for his hard work on this bill. Yesterday, he made clear that he will 
offer a substitute that seeks to correct the one glaring flaw contained 
within S. 1315, a provision that would divert $221 million over the 
next 10 years to create a special pension for Filipino veterans of the 
Second World War living in the Philippines who have no service-
connected disability. That money, of course, would be diverted at the 
expense of American veterans living in America. The Senator from North 
Carolina spoke eloquently about the fact that diverting these resources 
from our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan represents 
misplaced priorities, and I agree with him.

My expectation is the Senate will have a healthy debate concerning 
this provision. Senators on my side of the aisle will have ample 
opportunity to amend the committee bill so we can have a bill that will 
pass with bipartisan support and be signed into law. It is my hope we 
can work together on this bill and produce another strong, bipartisan 
achievement for our veterans. I expect that to happen certainly in the 
very near future. We will have an opportunity in our conference at noon 
to discuss going forward, but we anticipate moving forward with the 
Burr amendment early in the process. I think we are going to be able to 
get a strong, bipartisan accomplishment in the very near future in the 
Senate.
