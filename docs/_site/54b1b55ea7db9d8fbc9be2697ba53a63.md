`Mr. FEINGOLD â€” 8 February 2007`

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted for GEN George W. Casey, Jr., to 
be U.S. Army Chief of Staff. While questions have been raised about 
General Casey's performance as U.S. commander in Iraq, I do not believe 
the general can be held responsible for the failures of a policy 
devised at the highest levels of this administration.

But my vote to confirm General Casey does not change my opposition to 
the President's policies in Iraq. The President has made the wrong 
judgment about Iraq time and again, first by taking us into war on a 
fraudulent basis, then by keeping our brave troops in Iraq, and now by 
sending 21,500 more American troops into harm's way.

The indefinite presence of U.S. military personnel in Iraq will not 
fix that country's political problems. And as we have seen over the 
last few years, sending more troops will not provide the stability in 
Iraq that can only come from a political agreement. Congress must 
develop the courage to confront this President on what has become one 
of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in our history.
