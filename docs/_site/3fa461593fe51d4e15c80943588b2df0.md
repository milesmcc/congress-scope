Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I rise to support the resolution 
and to express my opposition to the President's plan to send additional 
troops to Iraq. While I rise as a Member of this House who opposed 
authorization of the Iraq war, I also rise as a member of the new 
Congressional majority, representing millions of Americans who voted 
for a new direction in Iraq, and I rise representing my own 34th 
congressional district of California, whose constituents overwhelmingly 
oppose this escalation.

Perhaps, most importantly, I rise as the proud stepmother of a U.S. 
Army serviceman who served in Iraq, and a proud wife of a marine who 
saw two tours of duty in Vietnam. While I will never personally 
experience war on the ground, I can speak from a wife and mother's 
perspective about what it means to have a loved one sent into harm's 
way.

Over 4 years ago, I spoke from that very perspective when I, with 
many of my colleagues, urged the President to exhaust all diplomatic 
efforts, give the U.N. weapons inspectors a chance to finish their job 
and, if necessary, establish a multilateral coalition force to confront 
Saddam before invading Iraq. These steps would have made it possible to 
say to my stepson and to all our Nation's sons and daughters, your 
country did everything in its power to keep you from harm's way.

Regrettably, the President did not do everything in his power to keep 
them from harm's way. We know now that decisions to invade Iraq were 
based on, at best, faulty intelligence, and, at worst, intelligence 
viewed to favor a


specific policy outcome. It is breathtaking now to consider how 
incomplete, simplistic, or just plain wrong our intelligence and 
projections were about the need to invade Iraq.

It is breathtaking to consider the cost to our Nation of this ill-
conceived and mismanaged war in which billions of dollars have been 
spent without significant and appropriate oversight of the war effort, 
the occupation, or the plan for reconstruction and withdrawal from 
Iraq. Even more tragic is the huge price that has been paid in American 
and Iraqi lives and in our esteem around the world.

I share the commitment of my husband and stepson and that of all 
Americans to defend this Nation against all enemies. I believe, even as 
a peaceful Nation, we must be resolute in our determination to defend 
our country against hostile interests.

But the bar to war must be set high, and information on which we base 
our entry into war or escalate our involvement must be clear, 
compelling, and as unfiltered as possible. The President did not, in 
good faith, make the case to preemptively and unilaterally go to war in 
Iraq, and he has not made the case for this escalation. He has not 
explained to the American people why, after four failed escalations, 
this one will succeed. Even many of his generals and military advisors 
oppose this plan. To give approval to this administration, to continue 
its failed strategy, and put into jeopardy the lives of an additional 
20,000 troops defies common sense.

Madam Speaker, we will all forever be grateful to the brave men and 
women in uniform who have done everything they have been asked to do 
valiantly and courageously.

Therefore, I continue to hope that the debate over this resolution 
will be absent the charges that we undermine their mission and their 
morale, for this is nonsense. There is not a Member in this body that 
does not respect and honor their service or support their efforts. Our 
message is to the Commander in Chief, not the brave troops who serve 
our Nation.

Four years ago, I asked myself whether we were doing everything in 
our power to keep our Nation's sons and daughters out of harm's way. 
Four years later, I stand here to oppose this escalation and ask that 
we begin the process of doing everything in our power to take our sons 
and daughters out of harm's way and bring them safely home
