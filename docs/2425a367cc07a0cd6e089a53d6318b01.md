Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1879, as 
amended.

This bill amends title 38 United States Code to provide for 
employment and reemployment rights for certain individuals ordered to 
full-time National Guard duty. Madam Speaker, it's well known that the 
National Guard and Reserve units have carried a significant load in the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of these units have served multiple 
combat tours, and others have provided homeland security services, such 
as maintaining an airborne alert here in the D.C. area. Additionally, 
Guard units have performed heroically at times when natural disasters 
like Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.

As a result of these demands, many of the members of the Guard have 
accumulated significant active duty time and are now in danger of 
exceeding the 5-year limit on active duty that is protected under the 
Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, or USERRA. So 
I'm pleased that our colleague Mike Coffman from Colorado has taken the 
action to recognize that active duty performed under title 32 should be 
added to the types of duties exempted from the 5-year limit. I also 
thank Chairman Herseth Sandlin and Ranking Member Boozman of the 
Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity for their bipartisan work, as well 
as Chairman Filner for bringing this bill to the floor.

With that, Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to Mr. 
Coffman, a fellow veteran who served in the Army and the Marines in the 
first gulf war and second gulf war in Iraq.
