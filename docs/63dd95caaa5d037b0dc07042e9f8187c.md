Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
irresponsible spending bill.

Mr. Speaker, we owe it to our brave service men and women who are 
fighting for freedom and democracy in Iraq to make sure that they are 
the best equipped and most successful troops in the world. While the 
Democrats would have you believe that this legislation does just that, 
it couldn't be further from the truth.

This supplemental is a prescription for defeat in Iraq by tying the 
hands of our military leaders and setting a date certain for 
withdrawing our troops. If we fail in Iraq, the resources now devoted 
by terrorist organizations and nations sponsoring terrorism there would 
be turned to spreading terror around the globe, including, again, on 
American soil.

It is through the hard work and sacrifice of our American troops that 
the ideals of freedom continue to be spread. We owe them the resources 
they need to complete their mission, but this bill does not meet that 
threshold.

Mr. Speaker, I am also alarmed that the Democrats are treating a 
wartime, let me repeat, wartime funding bill as a collection cup for 
pet projects.

Many Members have already mentioned the litany of pet projects in the 
bill, so I do not need to repeat these so-called domestic emergency 
spending provisions. I would like to mention, though, how ridiculous 
this bill must seem to troops and their families listening or watching 
us on C-SPAN.

Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how I will respond when asked by 
constituents why funding for some $15 billion in pet projects is 
necessary when attempting to fund the global war on terror.

Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt that some of these extraneous provisions 
may be worth examining, but how would we know? We did not hold 
oversight hearings on these issues and have, therefore, abdicated our 
responsibility to the taxpayer. If there is a problem, I am sure we can 
make the necessary fixes in regular order.

I urge my colleagues to vote down this legislation and fund our 
troops with a clean supplemental bill.
