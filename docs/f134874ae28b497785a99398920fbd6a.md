Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, it appears that Congress, in the name of 
supporting the troops, will soon give President Bush the money he needs 
to continue the war in Iraq even though we don't take care of the 
troops when they come home.

If Congress funds the war, what will happen next? More troop 
casualties; more innocent civilians die; more destruction to Iraq; more 
destruction to our budget here at home; cuts in health care and 
education and job creation and housing and, yes, in veterans care.

Unless Congress cuts off funds and brings our troops home, we will be 
in Iraq for years to come. And for what?

I have introduced H.R. 1234, a bill to bring our troops home and 
stabilize Iraq.

Congress must take the first step and stop funding the war. Support 
the troops. Bring them home. Support H.R. 1234
