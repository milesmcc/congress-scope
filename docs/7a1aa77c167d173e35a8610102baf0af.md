Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to know where we 
stand on the President's troop escalation plan, and this week every 
Member of this House will have an opportunity to explain why he or she 
supports or opposes President Bush's plan to send 21,500 more troops to 
Iraq.

The resolution that we are debating this week is a straightforward 
two-page bill. First, it highlights our continued support for our 
troops in Iraq. And second, it voices opposition to the President's 
troop increase plan.

The American people don't want Congress to continue to shirk from its 
responsibility to oversee the Bush administration's implementation of 
this war. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened in the Senate, 
where a bipartisan resolution opposing the President's troop escalation 
plan is being kept hostage from the Senate floor by Republicans who 
seem content to allow the President to conduct this war any way he sees 
fit.

Mr. Speaker, the American people have unequivocally called on 
Congress to discuss this situation in Iraq and to take action to change 
our course there. Here in this House, we have begun the process this 
week.
