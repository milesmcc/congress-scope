`Mr. EDWARDS of Texas â€” 14 May 2009`

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is Military Appreciation 
Month, so it is appropriate that on the floor of this House earlier 
this week Members of Congress stood up and showed their support with 
their words for our troops. Today, we can do something even more 
important; we can support our military troops and their families with 
our deeds. That is exactly what the $3.2 billion in military 
construction in this bill does in four ways.

First, it includes $488 million, the same as the President's request, 
for five wounded warrior complexes for the Army and two complexes for 
the Marine Corps. These facilities support many of our most severely 
wounded combat troops and their families through their important 
recovery and healing process.

Second, this bill includes $276 million, also the same as the 
President's request, for 25 child development centers at Department of 
Defense installations.



These funds will provide additional child care for 5,000 military 
children, a high priority for our military families, especially with so 
many parents serving our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Third, the bill adds an additional $1 billion for Department of 
Defense hospital construction. Why? Because many of our military 
hospitals are riddled with aging inadequate structures that do not meet 
current standards for medical care. This is unacceptable in time of 
peace and unconscionable in time of war.

No Member of this Congress, no Member of the Senate, no citizen of 
America should want to see a return to the Walter Reed Annex 18 of 
several years ago when Army soldiers had to live in such deplorable 
conditions.

The funds in this bill would bring our total investment in military 
hospitals over the past year to $3.3 billion. This House will initiate 
the funding to modernize our DOD hospital for our troops.

Fourth, this bill includes more funds for troop housing in 
Afghanistan. The President's request for projects in the CENTCOM area 
of responsibility total $876 million, including $84 million to 
partially fund the foundation and utility work needed to house 
additional U.S. troops going to Afghanistan. This bill supports 98 
percent of the request and includes an additional $214 million to fully 
fund the troop housing requirement in Afghanistan.

Finally I'd mention that this bill includes $263 million, the same as 
the President's request, once again, to accelerate and enhance the 
construction of new DOD hospitals in Bethesda and Fort Belvoir to 
replace the aging Walter Reed.

By voting for this bill, we can support our troops and their families 
with our deeds, not just our words. I urge our colleagues to vote 
''yes'' on this bill.
