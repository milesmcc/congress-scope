Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I rise in support of this supplemental package. Obviously, we need to 
get the money to the troops in the field, and, also, my State of 
Louisiana needs these additional funds as well.

But I want to point something out that has not been discussed in the 
debate. The President called for 10 new provincial reconstruction teams 
for Baghdad. Upon arrival in Baghdad, General Petraeus has asked for 
14, four additional PRTs. State and USAID cannot really adequately plan 
to put this into effect. Particularly, they are phase 3, where they get 
the personnel in position. So the much-needed money for the State 
Department is in this supplemental. And for those of us who are 
interested in seeing the political and economic side of our plan 
enacted and successful in Iraq, it greatly depends on getting this 
funding to the State Department.

So I urge our colleagues to support this supplemental package, 
particularly those of you who are interested in the economic and 
political side of this, because if we are going to push for 
reconciliation, it is clearly critical to have these State Department 
personnel on the ground providing that on-the-ground pressure to move 
toward reconciliation in Iraq.
