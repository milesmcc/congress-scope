Mr. BAIRD. I thank the gentlelady, the Chair, and the ranking member 
for their support of this. Point well taken. This does call for a 
study. I think there are a number of groups under criteria that 
establish this program, merit discussion and examination, and 
particularly those who have come to our aid overseas. I'm familiar with 
some really heart-wrenching stories of folks who have been 
extraordinarily helpful to our country and face great personal hardship 
in Iraq and in Afghanistan. If we can help them rebuild their lives 
over here if they're forced to flee their country, that would be a 
meritorious deed.

But again, this is just calling for a study and, therefore, I urge 
its passage. I am grateful for the support.

I yield back the balance of my time.
