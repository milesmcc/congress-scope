Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Chairman, American contractors in Iraq have lived 
by their own rules for far too long. While American taxpayers fund the 
equipping and training of these private military contractors, companies 
like Blackwater continue to escape accountability to international, 
Iraqi or even American laws.

Today, the Democratic Congress will put an end to the question of 
whether we are training mercenaries and murderers in place of our 
Nation's warriors. By passing H.R. 2740, we can ensure that contractors 
in Iraq are held accountable under American criminal law. There is no 
excuse to allow private contractors and subcontractors to exist without 
legal accountability.

Madam Chairman, we must never forget that the way to end the abuses 
by contractors in Iraq is to bring our troops and our military 
contractors, 180,000 of them, home from Iraq as soon as practicable.
