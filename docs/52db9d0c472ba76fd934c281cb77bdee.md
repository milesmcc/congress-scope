Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, today America and our allies in Iraq 
are breathing a collective sigh of relief as we continue to receive 
successful report after successful report of al Qaeda's demise in Iraq.

We continue to pray for a complete end to hostilities, but today we 
pause to thank America's brave military members and also their family 
members.

Just recently, 168 brave men and women returned from the famous Red 
Bulls to Minnesota. They were deployed for 13 months, and we thank them 
for their sacrifice.

The happy news is that not one of the 168 returned home with serious 
injury. Everyone was able to walk out and meet their loved ones.

It seems every generation has to learn the lessons of freedom. 
Freedom is precious, Madam Speaker, and we thank those today who 
secured our freedom and the freedom of our allies.
