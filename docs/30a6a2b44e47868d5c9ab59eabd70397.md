Mr. CORNYN. I agree with the argument the Senator from New Hampshire 
has made about the importance of our prosecuting the war against terror 
and particularly what has been called by the terrorists themselves 
''the central front in the war on terror'' in Iraq.

Some of our colleagues have introduced a resolution, which the 
Senator has spoken to, which is a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate 
resolution. I heard others this morning talk about imposing caps on the 
number of troops we might deploy there.

I ask the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, if it is so 
important that we not fail in Iraq and that the region not descend into 
either a failed state or a launching pad for future terrorist attacks 
or a regional conflict ensue, does he not believe it would be important 
for those who criticize the President's announced plan to offer a 
constructive alternative of their own, if they believe that the 
President's chosen plan is not the best course of action?
