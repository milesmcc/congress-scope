# CHANGING DIRECTION TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY

Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, today the House will vote on and hopefully 
pass the emergency supplemental bill. To the individuals who disagree 
with this new direction and our demand for accountability, I ask, how 
much longer will you continue to sanction the undermining of our 
national security under the Bush-Cheney policy? As a member of the 
Armed Services Committee, I ask this because this bill states that ''no 
units may be deployed to Iraq unless they are fully mission capable.''

What are you saying if you vote against this measure? In the Armed 
Services Committee, the Army Chief of Staff testified that the Bush-
Cheney strategy is outstripping the means to execute it. Our ground 
forces in the U.S. are short of training, personnel and equipment. This 
is very serious, and I ask how anyone can vote against this bill and 
sanction the unwise Bush-Cheney course.

The risk to our Nation is serious and deepening. We must change 
direction, make more strategic decisions and bring our diplomatic, 
economic and moral forces to bear to protect our national security.
