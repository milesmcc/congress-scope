Mr. ELLSWORTH. Madam Chairman, I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) for helping cosponsor 
this amendment, which is really a shame that we have to file this 
amendment. It's a very commonsense, straightforward amendment that, as 
much as I hate to say it, that we found out about it in a newspaper 
article.

It requires contracts awarded by the Department of Defense to 
prohibit contractors from using subsidiaries or subcontractors as a 
foreign shell company performing the work of the contract of a U.S. 
citizen. In this amendment, a foreign shell company is an entity 
incorporated outside the U.S. or Canada that does not manage, direct, 
or exercise operational control over personnel performing work under 
contract.

Now, what that means in plain English is that companies that are 
receiving government contracts and working overseas, Iraq and 
Afghanistan, are opening post office boxes in the Grand Caymans. A box. 
No employees, no telephone, no apartments, not an office, not an 
employee. Yet they claim to be a company out of the Grand Caymans.

What that does, Madam Chairman, is it cheats our government, it 
cheats our taxpayers at home, and it cheats the folks that work for 
these companies. This was originally found out by a person going in and 
filing for a disability claim, and they said, You're not an employee of 
the United States.

Madam Chairman, this is wrong, and we need to close this loophole. 
This simple, straightforward amendment that simply closes this is what 
we want to do here. And I think it's a straightforward amendment.

I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentlelady from Connecticut 
(Ms. DeLauro).
