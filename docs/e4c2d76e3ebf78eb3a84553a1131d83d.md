Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, people who are watching this 
debate across the country are getting confused with all of the rhetoric 
that is going on. It boils down to two things: the Democrats, who 
promised fiscal responsibility, in this bill are spending $31.5 billion 
more than the President requested. They are busting the budget already 
when they promised America fiscal responsibility. So America, remember 
that. Remember that. They said they are going to balance the budget and 
they are not going to raise your taxes. They are already trying to 
raise your taxes. So raising your taxes and spending $31.5 billion more 
than they said they would on this bill.

Finally, the second issue is capitulation. If we do what they want, 
if we redeploy, as they call it, it is a withdrawal, and the vacuum 
that is going to be filled in Iraq will be filled by the radicals, the 
radical terrorists, al Qaeda and their fellow travelers. It is 
capitulation and budget busting. That is what they are all about today.
