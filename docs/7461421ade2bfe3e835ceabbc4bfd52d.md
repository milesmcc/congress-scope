Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleagues have described it well. This 
is a very important vote. I think the reason we have gotten to this 
point shows how difficult it is to get anything done in this Chamber. I 
come from a State that is first in the Nation in the number of people 
80 years old or older as a percentage of our population. I think we are 
in the top five or six, of people 65 years of age or older as a 
percentage of our population.

Medicare is so unbelievably important to the folks who live in my 
State. Does anybody think it serves the interests of this Medicare 
program to say: Well, let's decide on provider cuts--in this case 
physician cuts--of 10.6 percent? Let's take a big whack, a 10.6-percent 
whack out of the reimbursements and it would not matter; it would not 
affect the program. It doesn't make any sense to me at all that we 
would do that.

What we need to do is strengthen this program, and that is what the 
underlying bill does. We have had an awful time trying to pull it 
through the Congress. We finally got it through the Congress, and then 
we had the President veto the bill. We had a colleague come out of his 
sick bed and fly to Washington, DC, to cast the 60th vote, after which 
the other side collapsed and we got 9 other votes. This is very 
important. This is about who we are as a country, what we decide to 
invest in.

It is said that 100 years from now we will all be dead. I guess that 
is not just said; it is a fact. Only historians will take a look at our 
value system. They can take a look at what we decided to do as a 
Congress: How did we decide to spend money? What did we invest in? What 
did we think was important? What were our value systems? Did we believe 
the Medicare Program--providing health care to America's elderly--was a 
successful program, or did we decide we wanted to begin to take it 
apart?

That is what this vote is about. I don't understand at all why the 
President decided to veto this.

This passed the House of Representatives by a margin of 6 to 1 and 
got 69 votes in the Senate, and the President decides to exercise his 
veto.

It is unfathomable to me how much money we shovel out of this 
building and how much the President recommends when we spend overseas: 
$170 billion, $180 billion this year in emergency funding for Iraq and 
Afghanistan and all these programs to replenish all these accounts; 
contractor abuse. Somehow that doesn't matter so much. All of a sudden 
we want to make an investment in the Medicare Program, and that is not 
something that is valuable to us, the President suggests. It makes no 
sense to me.

In this bill, we have also tried to address the problem of disparate 
reimbursements for the various States. Some of the smallest States in 
this country--mine included--receive reimbursements under the Medicare 
program for providing health care that are dramatically different than 
reimbursements in other areas. Without fixing that, there will be a 
degradation of medical services and the delivery of services. This bill 
addresses part of that. That is why this bill is so critically 
important.

I hope we will have a resounding vote overriding the President's veto 
this evening at 6 o'clock.
