Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Ladies and gentlemen, let me just say this: the 
American people are waiting on this Congress to finally stand up and be 
Congress. This is one of the reasons why we are in the position that we 
are in right now is because Congress has not done its job.

One of the most sterling moments of that was 2 years ago when it came 
to attention on this floor that our young men and women were over in 
Iraq without body armor. Every news cast had it where they were going 
into dung heaps, into landfills, trying to get body armor.

It was Democrats, at that time, that stepped forward and put the 
amendment in the resolution to make sure that our troops have body 
armor. And that is the genesis of this legislation.

This is a big ball game, and you have got to get to first base first. 
And what we are saying is, when we move out with this resolution, 
paramount is taking care of our troops, making sure that they have the 
body armor.

I am here to tell you the American people know that this war has had 
a tremendous drain on our American economy. The importance of this 
measure, ladies and gentlemen in this House, is that we cannot go 
forward without the confidence of the American people. Passage of this 
bill gives us that confidence.
