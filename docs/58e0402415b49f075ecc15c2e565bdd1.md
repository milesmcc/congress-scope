Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to be able to join you and my 
colleagues here today. Our topic today is something that is on the 
minds of Americans everywhere. It's the question of our economy, the 
seriousness of the recession and the steps that we are taking, whether 
they are constructive or destructive to repairing the financial 
condition of our Nation, our allies and of the world.

I suppose it goes without saying that the recession is something 
that's serious. We can look at it in various different ways because it 
affects each of us in different ways.

We could look at it from the fact that there are people who are 
husbands that have wives and children, who have mortgages that are due 
and no job and their bank account, already seriously whittled down, is 
shrinking even farther.

We have those who have even been thrown out of their homes, those who 
have lost all of the money that they had saved for retirement, their 
401(k)s are becoming 101(k)s. And it has a troubling aspect that we 
don't have any idea when is it going to let up and what will be the end 
of this ride, as the stock market goes down and down and people 
continue to suffer.

One of the things we have heard about over the last 6 years from our


liberal media and from others that are very critical of the foreign 
policies of America, as we stood up for freedom, was the tremendous 
cost of the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan.

To put in perspective what we are talking about here on this economy, 
if you were to add up the cost of the war in Iraq, every day of it, and 
add up the cost in Afghanistan, and the first 5 weeks of this Congress 
in the stimulus--it was called a stimulus bill, I call it a porkulus 
bill--we spent more money, what we voted for in the fifth week here, 
than we spent in all of those wars, all of those years added together. 
So we are talking about a lot of money, and that's just the beginning.

So I think it's appropriate for us to start out as we should. Instead 
of being too hasty and jump into things, to stop and just ask 
ourselves, how did we get in this mess? What policy mistakes did we 
make and what is our logical way forward?

The good news I have for you, my friends, today is, is that there is 
a way home. The policies that are necessary to turn this situation 
around are available to us. History has shown us what works and what 
doesn't work. So a bright future is available, as it has always been 
for America, if we make the right choices.



So, how was it that we got here? Well, the story starts some number 
of years ago, a number of administrations ago, when it came to people's 
attention that there were certain areas of some cities where you could 
live where it would really be hard to get a loan to own a house. We 
felt that it's part of the American Dream for somebody to be able to 
own a house.

So, we created a couple of groups. One was called Freddie Mac and the 
other was Fannie Mae. And the purpose of these groups--they were not 
quite government agencies, but they weren't quite private either. The 
purpose of them was to be able to make loans affordable to various 
people.

We also leaned on the bankers in those various communities, saying, 
As a bank, you have got to write some loans to people. Well, Who are we 
supposed to write the loans too? Well, People who don't have very good 
credit ratings. Let me see if I understand this correctly. What you're 
saying is, You want me to give loans to people, and it may be they are 
not going to pay the loan back. That's right. The government is telling 
you to do that.

In addition, as Freddie and Fannie had been created during the last 
years of Clinton's administration, what happened was that Freddie and 
Fannie were given legislative instructions saying that they had to make 
more and more loans to people who couldn't afford to pay them.

And at the time, in 1999, the New York Times had an article that 
said, Hey, we better look out. This is like the savings and loan deal 
about to happen all over again. We are about to make the same mistakes 
we made before. The mistakes were that if people can't pay these things 
back, then the securities that you package these different loans up--
and that is what Wall Street was doing, was packaging these 
securities--they won't be able to pay, and we are going to have a big 
problem because Freddie and Fannie, everybody assumes that the 
government will back up their loans. And if it's the government that 
backs them up, that means all of the taxpayers in America are going to 
be held hostage for loans that were made, and maybe to people that 
couldn't afford to pay them. And so this article was written in 1999, 
warning: Savings and loan scandal. Look out. We are starting to do the 
same mistake we made before, 10 years earlier. But we didn't pay 
attention.

By 2003, President Bush is also reported in the New York Times saying 
that what is going on in Freddie and Fannie is a big problem. It could 
create a whole lot of economic trouble for America. I need the 
authority to regulate Freddie and Fannie, the President was telling us.

That same New York Times article said that he was opposed by the 
Democrat Party. In fact, the recent chairman, and this is an actual 
quote from the New York Times, September 11, 2003, this is in response 
to President Bush asking for authority to regulate Freddie and Fannie. 
Now, this Democrat Congressman, Barney Frank says, ''These two 
entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not facing any kind of 
financial crisis,'' said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, 
the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, the man, I 
might add, who is working on the solution to this problem. ''The more 
people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these 
companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing.''

Well, anybody can be wrong. Some people can be terribly wrong. And, 
in this case, this mistake has turned the entire world economy upside 
down. And so we have a whole series of these loans.

Now, you all know that what has gone wrong has been that these loans 
have been in default. But this is what started with the loan business 
and has now affected all of our economy. So, this is where the problem 
started, but it has now spread. So we have a recession.

So, the question then is, this is where we got off track. We have the 
government spending just tons of money to try and turn this problem 
around, but the question is: How really should we go about fixing it.

And I am joined here in the Congress today by one of our 
distinguished colleagues, a new Member, from the State of Ohio. Steve 
Austria has some experience in this area and is rapidly making a name 
as quite a sober and distinguished Member of our body. And I would like 
to yield to the gentlemen if you would like to make a comment on where 
we are and where we should be going.
