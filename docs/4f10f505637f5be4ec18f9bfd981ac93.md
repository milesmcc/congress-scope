# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `4f10f505637f5be4ec18f9bfd981ac93`
`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 February 2007`

---


Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, again I would suggest to these 
supporters of the resolution that the President's key advisers, 
including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Pace, and 
the new commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, strongly support this 
increase in troops.

Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman 
from Washington State (Mr. Reichert).
