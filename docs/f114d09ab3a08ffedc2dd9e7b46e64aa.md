Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House 
for 1 minute.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 5, which would 
direct the President to establish Hire a Veteran Week.

As a veteran, I want to thank my colleague, Representative Holt, for 
introducing this resolution on behalf of our brave troops who fight for 
our freedom.

Madam Speaker, unemployment rates for veterans in their twenties are 
almost twice as high as their civilian peers.

This is unacceptable.

We're sending 18- and 19-year-olds to fight in a mistaken war in 
Iraq.

The least we can do is make sure that they have a good job when they 
come home.

The system is broken, Madam Speaker. And our veterans are paying the 
price.

Our veterans show us excellence in the battlefield--they will show us 
excellence in the workplace.

I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to give our 
veterans the dignity and respect they deserve.
