Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of freedom of the 
press and an informed public.

The Free Flow of Information Act (H.R. 2102) is a straightforward 
bill that will protect journalists from being legally obligated to 
disclose their confidential sources of information. This will allow 
sources to speak more freely, allowing for the vibrant exchange of 
important information between reporters, their contacts and the public.

Predictably, George Bush's Department of Injustice opposes today's 
legislation, in part because the Administration issued more than 300 
subpoenas last year alone. That's understandable. If I had a track 
record of wasting money on a failing war, abusing civil liberties, 
suppressing scientific research, and failing to enforce important 
consumer protections and environmental regulations, I too would want to 
keep the press and the public in the dark.

But it is also despicable. Forty-nine states and the District of 
Columbia already recognize a reporter's privilege to keep confidential 
sources, and to do so without risking interrogation or prosecution. A 
federal media shield law would further protect the public's right to 
know about corruption, waste and mismanagement in and out of 
government.

In the past few years, journalists have depended on confidential 
sources to inform them about the torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu 
Ghraib, the disclosure of CIA prisons in Eastern Europe, and the 
President's warrantless wiretapping program. If we left it up to the 
administration to decide what went into news stories, we would have 
headlines that told us the war in Iraq is a smashing success and that 
Dick Cheney's hunting technique is unparalleled.

The Constitution guarantees the right to a free press. That freedom 
depends on not having to worry about being punished for revealing 
information that the public has a right to know. I urge my colleagues 
to vote in support of this bill.
