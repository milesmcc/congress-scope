Mr. KLEIN of Florida. When we went into Iraq in the first place, they 
were supposed to be able to pay for their entire rebuilding through 
their own oil revenues. Unfortunately, that has not happened.

I know Mr. Perlmutter has been one of our leaders on renewable 
energy, as has Mr. Welch.

Mr. Welch, you have brought many ideas forward on renewable energy 
and alternative energy and energy independence. Why don't you bring us 
up to date on some of your thoughts.
