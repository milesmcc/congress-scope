Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, we do know that the war in Iraq will 
come up for debate in this body, as it should. But the debate on this 
floor should not be about partisan politics. It should be about doing 
what is in the best interests of our troops, making certain that we win 
in this global war on terror, and how we are going to keep this Nation 
and our communities and our cities safe.

I recently read a quote from Specialist Tyler Johnson. He is serving 
his first tour of duty in Iraq. When asked about the criticism back 
home, he said that passing no-confidence resolutions does send a 
message to our troops overseas: ''You may support or say we support the 
troops, but you're not supporting what they do, what they're here 
sweating for, what we bleed for, what we die for. It all just doesn't 
make sense to me.''

Mr. Speaker, I agree with Tyler and our troops. Passing no-confidence 
resolutions does send a message, and it is not a message of courage, of 
confidence and strength.

I agree, let's support Sam Johnson's House Resolution 511. Stand with 
and fully fund our troops.
