Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, let me say to the Members what hurts our 
troops.

I found our troops, 44,000, without body armor. I found our troops 
with a shortage of jammers. I found our troops with a shortage of up-
armored Humvees. I find our troops now, because of the policy, having 
to go back to Iraq before they have a year at home. I find our troops 
now because of the policy of this White House having to extend troops 
that have been there 13 months, and I find our troops having to go into 
combat untrained or not trained as well as they should, not going to 
the desert where they have this tremendous training area, going right 
into Iraq.

That is what hurts our troops. That is what hurts the morale of the 
troops when you send them without training, without the additional 
training they need, without the equipment they need and without the 
resources they need.

We are putting in the resources. If you vote against this bill, you 
are voting against the resources they need to go into combat.
