Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 3911, 
a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service 
located at 95 Church Street in Jessup, Pennsylvania, as the ''Lance 
Corporal Dennis James Veater Post Office.''

H.R. 3911 was introduced by Representative Carney of Pennsylvania on 
October 22, was reported from the Oversight Committee on December 12 by 
voice vote. This measure which has been cosponsored by 18 Members has 
the support of the entire Pennsylvania congressional delegation. Lance 
Corporal Veater was wounded in Anbar province, Iraq, and died of his 
wounds in Fallujah, Iraq. The mission was believed to be his last 
mission just 2 weeks before returning home.

Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this bill.

I reserve the balance of my time.
