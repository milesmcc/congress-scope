Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, as we await the President's speech 
regarding Afghanistan, there's a point that I wanted to make; and as is 
so often the case, that point is better made by somebody else. So I 
yield to Chinese General Sun Tzu, who wrote the following words 2,500 
years ago:

''In war victory should be swift.

''If victory is slow, men tire, morale sags. Sieges exhaust strength; 
protracted campaigns strain the public treasury.

''If men are tired, morale low, strength exhausted, treasure spent, 
then the feudal lords will exploit the disarray and attack. This even 
the wisest will be powerless to mend.

''I have heard that in war, haste can be folly. But never have I seen 
a delay that was wise.

''No nation has ever benefited from a protracted war.''

Mr. Speaker, that was true 2,500 years ago, and it's true today. We 
do not benefit from the protracted war in Afghanistan.
