Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I 
think the distinguished chairman and I have had a conversation that, 
following that, for the benefit of our colleagues, we would move to the 
Feingold amendment and with it we will seek a time agreement. Then with 
the cooperation of our colleagues, we will at least try as much as 
possible to dispose of Iraq amendments today, if we could.

I remind my colleagues we still have the basis of this bill, which 
has Wounded Warriors, pay raises, housing, training, and equipping of 
the men and women of the Armed Forces. We do have a number of pending 
amendments on the bill. I think, in fairness, we should try to dispose 
of the Iraq issue as soon as possible so we could move on to the rest 
of the bill and pass it so we can get to conference and get it signed. 
There are vital parts of this bill on which the chairman and members of 
the Armed Services Committee have worked literally months, and I hope 
we could get to that aspect of the legislation as well.
