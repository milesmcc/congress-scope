Mr. GRAHAM. We will talk more about this. The good news is, the surge 
is al-Qaida's worst nightmare. They have been rejected by the Sunnis in 
Iraq, and if we stay on them, we can destroy al-Qaida in Iraq. The bad 
news is, the current political infrastructure in Iraq is incapable of 
making the hard decisions for the moment. We have to think of new ways 
to push them.

There is much more to follow.

I yield the floor.
