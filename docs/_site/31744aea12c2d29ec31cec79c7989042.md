Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to rise today 
to honor Captain Jason Williams by entering his name in the 
Congressional Record, the official record of the proceedings and 
debates of the United States Congress since 1873. Today I pay tribute 
to Captain Jason Williams, for his continued service with the United 
States Army and his accomplishments while completing two tours in Iraq.

 The son of Mr. and Mrs. J.C. Williams, Captain Jason Williams is the 
youngest of four children and was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
In 1995, he graduated from Western High School, and enrolled at Prairie 
View A-M University. After his sophomore year of college, Captain 
Williams enrolled in the ROTC Program upon completion of basic training 
at Fort Knox, Kentucky. As a Second Lieutenant, he earned his Bachelors 
of Science in Biology/Pre-medicine with a minor in Chemistry and 
Military Science. While in college, Jason was awarded with the 
Outstanding College Brother of the Year by the Alpha Phi Alpha 
Fraternity, Inc. He has also been honored with the Retired Officer 
Association Award and the Reserve Officer Award.

 Captain Williams has served various assignments throughout his 
military career while serving overseas in the Republic of Korea, 
Friedberg Germany, and his two tours in Iraq. He received a Purple 
Heart during his most recent deployment in Iraq. He has also received 
the Bronze Star Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Southwest ASIA 
Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Global War of Terrorism 
Expeditionary Medal, and

 Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Captain Jason Williams for his 
accomplishments within the armed services. His leadership and the 
awards he has received as a result of his actions are truly 
commendable. I commend Captain Jason Williams for his service to our 
community, and wish him the best in his future endeavors.
