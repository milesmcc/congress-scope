`Mr. CARDIN â€” 18 September 2007`

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1257, the 
District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act. This bill would provide 
the 580,000 residents of our Nation's Capital the voting representation 
in the House of Representatives that is so long overdue. It would also 
give the State of Utah a temporary at-large seat in the House through 
the next reapportionment.

Today's vote presents us the opportunity to grant District of 
Columbia residents the voice in ''the people's House'' that other 
Americans possess. It is time to remember the cry of our Founders that 
''taxation without representation is tyranny'' and end the 
discriminatory treatment of our Capital City's residents.

District of Columbia citizens pay Federal taxes, and they deserve 
their full say in determining the direction of our country. They should 
have as much influence on the House and Senate floors as any other 
American over the policies that shape this Nation: our Tax Code, our 
involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, and our laws affecting Social 
Security, health care, and childcare.

The right to representation is a basic civil right, and this is no 
less than a moral issue. Since coming to Congress, I have supported 
full voting representation for the citizens of the District of Columbia 
that would comprise one voting member of the House of Representatives 
and two Senators. The authors of this bill have, after much 
deliberation, crafted a compromise that they believe can pass both 
Chambers and be sent to President Bush for his signature. I will 
support that compromise with the hope that one day we will be able to 
enact legislation providing full representation to the District.
