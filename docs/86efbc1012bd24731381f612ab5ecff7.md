Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, a recent CRS report shows that the 
United States is now spending $10 billion a month fighting the war in 
Iraq. That's over $2.5 billion a week.

And what does the American taxpayer get for this $10 billion a month? 
An Army being broken by repeated deployments; a National Guard that is 
unready or unable to respond to natural disasters or terrorist attacks 
at home because many of our men and women are in Iraq and most of our 
equipment is; an escalation in Iraq that has resulted in more death and 
little reduction in violence; an Iraqi government that is unable to 
govern, Iraqi security forces that refuse to fully stand up.

The war in Iraq has cost every man, woman and child in my district 
$3,077. For over $3,000 a person, the people in my district have gotten 
a war that was a strategic mistake and has made them less safe. It is 
time we end this war.
