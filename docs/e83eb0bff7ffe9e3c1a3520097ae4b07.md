Mr. WEBB. Another poll, of December 29, 2006, by the Military Times, 
the most credible military newspaper in America, indicates that barely 
one-third of our service members approve of the way the President is 
handling the war. In fact, only 41 percent of our military now believes 
the United States should have gone to war in Iraq in the first place.

I ask unanimous consent that this poll be printed in the Record.
