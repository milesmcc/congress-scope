Mr. KUCINICH. I am a proud Member of this institution. I believe in 
this Congress, and I believe in the Constitution of the United States. 
And I think moments arise in the history of this institution when we 
have to take a stand for the Constitution. That's why this Thursday I 
will introduce a privileged resolution that will call for Congress to 
reclaim its power under Article I, Section 8 as to whether or not we 
stay in Afghanistan.

Now, some people here may believe in that mission. I don't. Some 
people here may believe in the surge. I don't. Some people here may 
believe that we should stay there for as long as it takes to do 
whatever we want. I don't. I believe that Congress, though, needs to 
speak and to have a debate on Afghanistan and to be able to decide in 
our wisdom, if we so choose, to get out of Afghanistan, which is what I 
hope that we do.

But whether you're for it or against it, Congress finally will have a 
chance to have that debate because the privileged resolution is being 
introduced on Thursday. It will lay over the week, and next week we 
will finally have a debate over whether to stay in Afghanistan or 
leave. And I hope we vote to leave.
