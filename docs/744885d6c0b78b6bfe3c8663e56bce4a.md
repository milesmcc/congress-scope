Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Obey.

Mr. Murtha is right; it wasn't Bill Clinton that sent our troops into 
Iraq without appropriate equipment and without a plan to win the peace, 
it was the Bush administration. The war against Saddam Hussein was over 
in a few weeks, yet for over 3 years they have been trapped in a deadly 
crossfire of an Iraqi war. This bill is not micromanaging the war, it 
is the next logical step as Congress rediscovers its voice and its 
constitutional responsibility as a coequal branch of government.

This weekend 15,000 Oregonians made clear that this day cannot happen 
too soon. This is hard for me. I have never voted for a supplemental 
appropriation on this war, but I will vote tomorrow for the first 
enforceable deadline. It is what Americans want, and it is what our 
troops and their families deserve.
