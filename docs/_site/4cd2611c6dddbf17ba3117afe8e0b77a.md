Mr. KUCINICH. Four years ago, Congress was told we had no alternative 
but to go to war; that was wrong. Now Congress is telling the American 
people we have no alternative but to continue the war, and that by 
continuing the war for just another year or two we will then be able to 
end the war. War equals peace. I don't think so.

This war has achieved a momentum that has swept up into its tragic 
hold people of otherwise good will who would vote to continue a war 
when they really want peace and when the American people want peace.

I believe you cannot say you are for peace and vote to keep this war 
going. You cannot say you are for peace and facilitate the theft of 
Iraqi oil. You cannot say you are for peace and give the President 
enough money not just to keep this war going, but to attack Iran if he 
so chooses. If you want peace, vote for peace now. If you want peace, 
stop funding this war. If you want peace, stand for the truth.

What America must do and what Congress has the power to do is to stop 
the war now, use the money in the pipeline to bring the troops home, 
set in motion a diplomatic process that would involve the world 
community in moving into Iraq as our troops move out. We need to stand 
for peace. H.R. 1234 is the vehicle to do that
