Mr. SKELTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3159, introduced by my 
colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, Ellen Tauscher, the 
gentlelady from California, as well as other Members of the House.

Our troops and their families are stressed and they are under 
pressure. Yesterday, the USA Today newspaper had an article entitled, 
''Stress of War Hits Army Kids Hard.'' The article, sadly, was about 
the increasing number of child abuse and neglect cases among deployed 
Army families. The article quotes Amy Lambert, an Army wife living at 
Fort Stewart, Georgia. She states, ''I firmly believe that more time at 
home between deployments would be the most beneficial solution.'' I 
think that quote sums up the reason we're here and why this bill is 
before the House.

Our troops and their families are tired. They are being stressed by 
the continued and extended deployments. It's time that Congress takes a 
stand on behalf of our families and states in a clear, unequivocal 
voice that it is time that servicemembers have a minimum dwell time 
between deployments.

This bill would require that active component units and members be 
provided at least the same time at home as they are deployed. It would 
also require that Reserve and National Guardsmen who are called to 
deploy are given at least three times at home as they are deployed.

This proposed minimum period of deployment is less than the 
Department's own goal, which provides that active duty servicemembers 
should be deployed for 1 year, with 2 years back in home station, and 
Reservists and Guardsmen should have 5 years between deployments.

The Army recently implemented a policy that requires active duty 
units to deploy for 15 months and only spend 12 months back at their 
home station. This is a troubling sign, Mr. Speaker, since the time 
back at home station is used to reset, retrain and re-equip forces.

Servicemembers and their families are entitled to a predictable and 
stable time between deployments. Congress needs to step up on behalf of 
the troops, as well as their families, and say enough is enough.

We need to hold the Department accountable to their own policies and 
protect the readiness of our forces. That's no small thing. We have a 
moral responsibility to our troops to ensure


that their quality of life is reflective of the sacrifices that we ask 
them to make.

We need to ensure that our active forces have at least the same 
amount of time deployed that they have back home with their families, 
and that our citizen-soldiers have at least three times the amount home 
as that time deployed.

This bill is also about our national security and its readiness, and 
it's about strategic risk. This bill will help to ensure that our 
military can deal not only with Iraq, where they have been serving 
remarkably under extraordinarily difficult conditions for 4 years, but 
wherever the next conflict occurs, our force must have adequate time to 
train if it is to be prepared.

And in this exceptional all-volunteer force, we must keep our 
retention levels up if we are to insure that our military will be able 
to succeed both now and in the next fight, which, of course, is very 
unpredictable.

H.R. 3159 is a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to 
stand with us in support of our troops and in support of our families.

Before I reserve the balance of my time, I ask unanimous consent that 
the gentlelady from California (Mrs. Tauscher) control the time on my 
behalf.
