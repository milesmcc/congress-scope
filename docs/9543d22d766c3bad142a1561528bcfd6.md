`Mr. MARTINEZ â€” 24 April 2007`

Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I want to follow on the remarks of my 
dear friend from Colorado related to the current situation in Iraq. It 
appears some movement has been made on the war supplemental. 
Unfortunately, it is a flawed piece of legislation, one the crafters of 
it well know will be vetoed by the President. It will be vetoed for 
good reasons--because it contains completely unacceptable language, as 
was just being pointed out.

It is impossible for us to micromanage what is happening in the 
field. It is a bad idea for politicians in Washington to tell generals 
when and how they can move forces in a battle. It is a bad idea for us 
to slow-bleed our military as they face an unrelenting enemy. It is a 
bad idea for us to simply not have the wherewithal to stick with the 
fight at a time when it is difficult. The President this week again 
reiterated his commitment that he would veto a bill that had artificial 
timetables for withdrawal and that would empower the enemy. It gives 
the enemy hope and an opportunity to wait us out. There is no question 
about that. A deadline simply tells the enemy by what date they need to 
know that the American commitment is over.


Imagine the confusion for someone in Iraq trying to make a decision 
whether to cast their lot which, in fact, may mean the death of himself 
or herself, and their family, to support our effort there toward a 
democratic country. If they had no anticipation that our commitment was 
equal to theirs, they might simply wait it out. So how can we ever turn 
the political tide in our favor in Iraq if we don't show the commitment 
the people of Iraq must have in order to make a commitment to our 
stated goals?

General Petraeus is here. He met with the President yesterday; he 
will be meeting with Members of Congress. It is important that we ask 
him his assessment of the current situation.

I know there are many who would be ready to suggest that the surge is 
not working. In fact, the full surge is not in place because all of the 
troops are yet to be deployed for the surge, but some who already said 
it wouldn't work are now saying it hasn't worked. I wish to have 
General Petraeus's assessment of it. I want to know what the general on 
the ground--not a politician in Washington--thinks about the effort of 
success we are meeting with our effort at this point in time.

The Iraq Study Group has been mentioned. Congress should drop fixed 
deadlines for withdrawals of U.S. forces. As Commander in Chief, the 
President needs flexibility on draft deployments. This is from the 
cochair of the Iraq Study Group, Democrat Lee Hamilton.

It is important that we recognize the Iraq Study Group not only when 
it is convenient but also when it might be inconvenient.

I think it is very important that we not sound the voice of defeat. 
Imagine the surprise that must have come to our enemies--and whether we 
like it or not, we have enemies--imagine the delight that must have 
come when, from the halls of the Congress, from the leader of the 
Senate, they were told that they had, in fact, won; that the war was 
lost.

This is not the right thing to say at a time when our troops are 
engaged in battle. Nine U.S. soldiers lost their lives in the last 24 
hours alone. This is a difficult time. It is not a pleasant time. It is 
not an easy assignment. So for us to simply tell our troops in the 
field they have been defeated when they in fact have not, and for us to 
tell our enemies that in fact they have won when in fact they have not, 
is not a good idea. I believe it is terribly important that we attempt 
somehow in the midst of this rancor and debate that is so classic of 
modern day Washington that we find it within ourselves to look beyond 
the current moment of politics, beyond the political advantage that 
might be gained at any one moment or another, and seek within the 
depths of our souls the opportunity for us to begin to work together to 
try to find a solution to this very difficult problem.

It is a sure thing that we, in fact, have a problem on our hands, 
that Iraq is a difficult situation. There is no question they must 
reach a political settlement. There is no question that they must do--
the Iraqis themselves--the hard work of peace. However, as we do that, 
we need to also find it within ourselves to find a way of shaping a 
political consensus, for us to find a way to begin to talk to one 
another, not past one another, about how we resolve the issues in Iraq 
in a way that will enhance America's strength. It is not about 
defeating a point of view. It is not about defeating President Bush. A 
loss in Iraq would be a defeat for the United States of America. So how 
do we find a way to empower America to be a stronger country, to be a 
united country as we seek to defeat the enemies of our country, which 
surely are there, continuing to fight against us, wishing us to be 
unsuccessful, and wishing for our country to be defeated? We should 
pull together, Republicans and Democrats all, to try to find the common 
ground that will bring us to a sensible solution, to a sensible 
outcome, so America is not defeated, but the enemies of America are 
defeated.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
