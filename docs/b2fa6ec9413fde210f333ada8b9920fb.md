Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to continue my support for 
the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program--an 
essential effort to ensure the health of our Nation's children. Since 
the inception of this program, I have agreed with the goals of this 
program and strongly believe that it is necessary to meet our 
responsibilities and fulfill our commitment to children.

Although I wholeheartedly support the compromise agreement on the 
reauthorization of this program, it is exactly that: a compromise.

For the past 10 years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has 
helped


provide health care for millions of children from working families that 
do not qualify for Medicaid, but can't afford private insurance. These 
are the children of working families whose companies do not offer 
health insurance to their employees.

As the cost of health insurance rises and an increasing number of 
employers are unable or unwilling to provide health insurance to their 
employees and their families, the number of families who do not have 
health insurance has continued to rise.

While the number of the uninsured continues to rise, the percentage 
of low-income children without health insurance has dropped more than 
one-third since the creation of the Children's Health Insurance 
Program.

Currently the Children's Health Insurance Program provides coverage 
for 6.6 million children nationwide. This reauthorization would provide 
health care coverage for an additional 3.2 million children who are 
uninsured today. In California, an estimated 250,000 children will be 
added.

The Children's Health Insurance Program has always enjoyed the 
bipartisan support of our Congress, our Governors, and our President--
and the legislation we are voting on today reflects that spirit of 
cooperation.

I am glad to see that we have worked with many of our Republican 
colleagues on an issue so critical to the health of children across 
this Nation.

This bipartisan, bicameral agreement is largely based on the 
legislation passed by the Senate in July, which would fund outreach and 
enrollment efforts, allow States to use information from food stamp 
programs and other initiatives for low-income families to find and 
enroll eligible children, and give States the option to cover pregnant 
women for prenatal care vital to healthy newborn children.

In desperation and defiance, opponents of the Children's Health 
Insurance Program have made outrageous allegations maligning the 
effectiveness and success of this program.

Critics have claimed that this program extends to eligibility to 
wealthy families in America--this could not be further from the truth. 
In my own State of California, the average family income of children 
covered by this program is just 163 percent of the Federal poverty 
level--less than $34,000 a year for a family of four.

There have been claims that Children's Health Insurance funding goes 
to illegal immigrants--this is completely false. The reality is that 
undocumented immigrants have never been eligible for Medicaid or the 
Children's Health Insurance Program. Actually, there are restrictions 
within this program which deny health insurance to low-income children 
who are legal immigrants.

The President is spending $10 billion each month in Iraq, but has 
threatened to veto a bill that will provide 10 million children with 
access to health care. Under the President's proposal, he is willing to 
fund the Children's Health Insurance Program with an increase of $1 
billion a year--the cost of 3 days in Iraq.

If we fail to renew this program or if the President vetoes this bill 
as he has threatened to do, it is the children who will pay the price.

As we near the September 30 deadline to reauthorize this program, I 
strongly urge and implore that the President reconsider his position on 
this bill. The need of children knows no partisan or political 
barriers, and should not have to overcome the obstacles created by the 
President.

There is not a man or woman in this chamber who wouldn't do 
everything within their power to ensure the health of their own 
children--we should do no less for the children of our Nation.

The Members of this Congress have overwhelmingly expressed a 
commitment to children's health. Earlier this year, we passed a budget 
resolution which set aside $50 billion for the Children's Health 
Insurance Program, reaffirming our commitment to the continued success 
of this program.

We can still do more and we will, but this bill is a step forward in 
the right direction.

I would like to thank Senators Baucus and Rockefeller, Senators 
Grassley and Hatch and the members of the Finance Committee who worked 
so tirelessly to bring this legislation forward in a bipartisan way, 
and keep the focus of this bill where it should be--on the children.
