Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about my 
good friend, Senator John Warner from Virginia. When you first come to 
this body, you get to know people. Soon I got to know him as a 
Senator's Senator, because he was one of those people who was always 
trying to bring people together and take on the major issues that 
confront our country.

I had the distinct honor of traveling to Iraq and other countries 
with him and with the distinguished Presiding Officer. I admired the 
relationship between Senator Levin and Senator Warner as a template for 
how things should run in Washington, DC as we represent the 325 million 
people of America. There are two people from two different parties who 
work together to make sure that what we were doing was the very best 
job that we could to protect America.

So you are, both the Presiding Officer as well as Senator Warner, two 
of my most significant role models in this Chamber. I admire you both 
for your service.

The Senator from Virginia was a member of pulling together the Gang 
of 14. It was now some 2 years ago when we were debating whether there 
would be a ''nuclear option'' and whether we would move forward in 
saving some of the procedures and the very functioning of the 
institution of the Senate. I remember working in awe with him as he and 
Senator Byrd and others worked on that historic document at that time, 
and on so many other occasions where he has been the person who has 
been the glue to bring people together. So he is a Senator's Senator, 
because he is such a proud American and such a wonderful leader for 
Virginia and for the Senate.

But he also is a wonderful Senator because he has a very unique 
ability of bringing people together. I would hope that all of us, the 
100 Members of this Chamber, always continue to look to him for the 
kind of inspiration and great example he has been.

I yield the floor.
