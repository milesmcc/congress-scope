Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.

Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 10-year mark in this war, which is 
the longest war in U.S. history, we need to ask when is enough enough? 
How many of our brave men and women must be sacrificed in this never-
ending war? How much blood, how much treasure do we have to spend in 
Afghanistan? And, also, we have to ask ourselves do we need another 10 
years to figure it out. I suggest that we don't.

It's time to change course. It's time for Congress to assert itself 
in our responsibilities, in our role. We control the purse strings, and 
enough is enough. We need to say today that we must begin to safely 
withdraw our young men and women from Afghanistan. No more funds for 
combat operations.
