`Mr. LEVIN â€” 21 July 2009`

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me commend Senator Lieberman and others 
who support this amendment. We in the Armed Services Committee are very 
supportive of previous increases; indeed, we led the way on some of 
them. Because of the stress on the Army and the number of commitments 
which had been made in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must give the kind of 
support to our troops they deserve and the American people want us to 
give.

One of the ways we can reduce some of the stress is by increasing the 
end strength so the dwell time is more sufficient and there are other 
positive spinoffs as well from this kind of increase in the authorized 
end strength.

The Secretary made a very powerful speech the other day when he 
called for an increase of 22,000, I believe, in the end strength. That 
end strength is temporary, it is almost as large as this--not quite; 
this is 30,000, but this is surely in the ballpark. It is appropriate. 
It is authority, it is not mandatory, and I think it is a very positive 
signal to send to our men and women in uniform and to their families. I 
very much support the amendment.
