Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina with such 
prescient words she brings to us.

I want to bring my colleagues' attention to the next poster I have 
got. I am going to give two quotes, one from General Petraeus from the 
hearing today and the other from Ambassador Crocker.

First from General Petraeus: ''To summarize, the security situation 
in Iraq is improving, and Iraqi elements are slowly taking on more of 
the responsibility for protecting their citizens. Innumerable 
challenges lie ahead. However, coalition and Iraqi security forces have 
made progress towards achieving sustainable security. As a result, the 
United States will be in a position to reduce its forces in Iraq in the 
months ahead.'' That was from the testimony of General David Petraeus. 
Later in the hour we will talk a little more about specific 
recommendations for troop withdrawal that General Petraeus made.

I will read that quote from Ambassador Crocker in just a minute, but 
at this point I see my friend from Mississippi is still with us, and I 
would like to yield to him, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
Wicker).
