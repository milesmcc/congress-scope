Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from 
Florida for yielding me this time, and also for your effective 
leadership on the House Rules Committee.



Also, let me just acknowledge and thank our chairman of the House 
Armed Services Committee, Chairman Skelton, for his dedication to the 
brave men and women who are serving in the Armed Forces and also to our 
national security.

I believe in this bill, Madam Speaker, that we should be taking 
meaningful steps to end the occupation of Iraq and to bring our troops 
home. Iraq is in a civil war, and our occupation only inflames the 
insurgency and puts our troops in harm's way. The facts on the ground 
betray the administration's empty rhetoric.

A majority of the American people support withdrawal from Iraq, and 
here we have a chance to press the issue further. We need enforceable 
timetables for withdrawal from Iraq, and we must hold this 
administration accountable.

Also, I am disappointed that the amendment which Congresswoman 
Woolsey and I offered was not made in order. Our amendment basically 
would have just simply required the President to present a plan for 
withdrawal and execute complete withdrawal within 6 months. It 
recognizes that there is no military solution to this civil war.

The bottom line is that we must continue to demand that the President 
end the occupation and bring our troops home, and we must do so at 
every opportunity.
