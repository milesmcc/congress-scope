Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I also want to endorse the gentleman from 
Connecticut's idea about reconstituting the Iraq Study Group and 
sending them back over to Iraq at some point to help give us an update 
of this very useful report. I think we all can agree that many of us in 
this country, and I suspect in Iraq too, are frustrated by this slow 
pace of reconciliation that is ongoing in Iraq.

But, again, another point about this report, and I think this 
gathering tonight, I think this helps us as Americans try to reconcile 
our differences. We talk about Iraqi reconciliation, but I think in 
many respects we need a little reconciliation of our own.
