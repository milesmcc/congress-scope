Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, last night the Senate stayed in session and 
they're probably still in session because they can't get an agreement 
to discuss the resolution, the bill that this House has already passed, 
a similar one to end the war in Iraq and redeploy our troops and bring 
our troops home.

This House, on several occasions, has passed bills with benchmarks to 
respond to the American people's wishes and end this horrific war. The 
Senate hasn't been able to do it because they need 60 votes to avoid 
filibuster. That's what they have going on now.

And that's the problem, Mr. Speaker, is the procedures in the Senate, 
and that's why we're still in this horrific war, a war where the Prime 
Minister of Iraq has said he can provide for the security of his 
country by January 1 and he does not need our troops.

Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that Emily Post's rule should be 
invoked. When you're a visitor and your host says you're no longer 
needed and no longer wanted, you pack your bags and you go home. I 
would advise the President, Mr. Speaker, to listen to Emily Post and be 
a good visitor and bring our troops home and stop losing lives 
needlessly.
