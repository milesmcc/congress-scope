Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I wanted very much to be on this 
floor this evening with Eleanor Holmes Norton first because I want to 
show my strong support for her, her work, her love for the District of 
Columbia and for the way she has used every bit of her time and efforts 
to fight for voting rights for Washington, DC.

I admire her spirit, I admire her commitment and I admire the way she 
has educated the entire Congress of the United States on this issue and 
forged a relationship with people on the other side of the aisle to get 
us to the point where we are.

I know that it is disappointing sometimes to feel you have come so 
close, and it still hasn't happened, but I am convinced it will happen, 
because of you, Eleanor Holmes Norton. It will happen because you will 
not allow it not to happen.

So I wanted to be here this evening more than to simply talk about 
the unfairness of not having voting rights. We all know that. I wanted 
to be here tonight to say to you, sister, I am with you. I have 
marched, and I will march again. I have sat in, and I will sit in 
again.

I started on this issue when I was in the California State 
legislature, and sometimes I feel a little guilty because I don't think 
I demonstrated long enough and hard enough to show how much I care 
about this.

I come from a time and place in St. Louis, MO, where I was educated 
in an elementary school called the James Weldon Johnson elementary 
school, with strong teachers who taught us the Constitution. We learned 
the Declaration of Independence. We learned what happened with the 
British and about the Boston Tea Party, and we learned about Patrick 
Henry, who declared, ''Give me liberty or give me death.''

So, whether or not it was intended, it was instilled in us that in 
this America, despite the fact that we had witnessed discrimination, we 
had been marginalized, that we have a right in this democracy to 
participate fully.

I really believed that, and if it was not intended, then they 
shouldn't have taught it to us, because we didn't think they were 
talking about somebody else. We truly believed they were talking about 
all of us.

Mr. Speaker, there is not a day that passes as I look around this 
Capitol that I am not reminded of the slaves that happened to build 
these marvelous buildings. I am reminded on a daily basis of the people 
who work right here in the Capitol, in these buildings, who live in the 
District of Columbia, who hear us wax eloquently day in and day out 
about democracy and participation and the Voting Rights Act.

These are the people who serve us day in and day out, and serve us 
well. You come into this Capitol late in the evening and you see who is 
working and how hard they work and what they do for all of us. And yet 
we walk past


them every day, and we don't stop to say, ''I'm so sorry. You should 
have the right to have the representation in the Congress of the United 
States that you deserve and we thought would have been guaranteed by 
the Constitution of the United States.''

So, Eleanor Holmes Norton, thank you. Thank you for the love that you 
have for the District. I know that your constituents know this. You 
don't have to prove anything to anybody, because your daily work proves 
who you are and what your values are and what you care about.

I want you to know, November 7th gave us a new opportunity here. The 
people have voted, and the people have said to us they want to see 
change. The people are angry about what happened with Katrina. They are 
angry about Iraq. They are angry basically about injustice. And even 
those folks who oftentimes have been silent on the issue, they know 
injustice when they see it and feel it very deeply.

So I am hopeful that we will be able to use this time that we have to 
provide the leadership, to give you the support, to make sure we do 
justice by the District of Columbia and ensure that you get your voting 
rights.
