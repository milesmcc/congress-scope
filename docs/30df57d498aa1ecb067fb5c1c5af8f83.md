Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, as Senator Grassley wrote in a letter 
to The Washington Post, it's fine to have a philosophical debate over 
the merits of this program, but opponents should be intellectually 
honest about what the bill does and does not do.

Despite this, the President and a few supporters are still clinging 
to a series of distortions and spin to try to mislead the public. The 
President keeps talking about families earning as much as $83,000. If 
this were true, I would have voted against this program. And as for the 
exception for New Jersey, the $72,000 was requested by a Republican 
Governor and approved by President Bush's administration. Some of the 
President's supporters have claimed we didn't provide a way to pay for 
this bill, but we did. As Americans, we want our children to be healthy 
and productive.

The irony did not escape me that while the President was attacking 
SCHIP, I was sitting in a hearing of the Armed Services Committee, of 
which I am a member. The topic was waste and fraud in Iraq, billions of 
dollars. Like I said, the irony did not escape me, and it did not 
escape most Americans.

We must override this veto.
