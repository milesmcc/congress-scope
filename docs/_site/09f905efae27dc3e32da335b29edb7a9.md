`Mr. BENNET â€” 27 September 2010`

---


Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today 
to honor the life and heroic service of Captain Dale A. Goetz. Captain 
Goetz, assigned to the 4th Infantry Division, based at Fort Carson, CO, 
died on August 30, 2010, of injuries sustained when an improvised 
explosive device detonated near his vehicle. Captain Goetz was serving 
in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in the Arghandab River Valley, 
Afghanistan. He was 43 years old.

A native of White, SD, Captain Goetz graduated in 1995 from Marantha 
Baptist Bible College in Watertown, WI, with a bachelor's degree. After 
serving in White for several years as a pastor, Captain Goetz enlisted 
in the Army in 2004 and served tours in Japan, Iraq and Afghanistan--
all with decoration.

During his years of service, Captain Goetz distinguished himself 
through his courage, dedication to his soldiers, and unremitting 
devotion to his faith. His skillful ministry comforted troops and made 
them more effective in the field, and he never hesitated to engage and 
counsel others who held beliefs different than his own.

Captain Goetz worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the 
most dangerous areas of Iraq and Afghanistan. He is remembered by those 
who knew him as a consummate professional with an unending commitment 
to excellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated husband and as a 
loving father to his three children.

Mark Twain once said, ''The fear of death follows from the fear of 
life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Captain 
Goetz's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly 
putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a 
sense of the highest honorable purpose.

At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones 
throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. And though his fate was uncertain, he 
pushed forward, counseling our soldiers and promoting the ideals we 
hold dear. For his service and the lives he touched, Captain Goetz will 
forever be remembered as one of our country's bravest.

To his wife Christina, his sons Landon, Caleb, and Joel, and his 
entire family--I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope 
that, in time, the pain of your loss will be eased by your pride in 
Dale's service and by your knowledge that his country will never forget 
him. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.

construction industry, Sergeant Grochowiak changed direction to commit 
his life to defending his country. He enlisted in the


Army in 2000, serving two tours in Iraq and two tours in Afghanistan--
all with decoration.

During nearly 11 years of service, Sergeant Grochowiak distinguished 
himself through his courage, dedication to duty, and absolute 
commitment to his troops. Despite having received a medical waiver for 
his last tour in Afghanistan, Sergeant Grochowiak shipped out and 
fought on anyway, citing his obligation to protect his young soldiers.

Springs, Specialist Hinkley changed course and became the family's 
fourth generation to serve in the military.

During her nearly 3 years of service, Specialist Hinkley 
distinguished herself through her courage, dedication to duty, and

bravery and talent. In fact, on the day of her passing, Specialist 
Hinkley had just been promoted.

age, as a student in Monte Vista, Specialist Hinkley's talents were 
always on display as a mentor to younger girls.

life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.''

Laghman Province, Afghanistan. He was 20 years old.

finally wear a service uniform. Private Montoya enlisted in the Army 
after graduation, and he deployed for Afghanistan in April 2010.

During his 13 months of service, Private Montoya distinguished 
himself through his dedication to duty and extraordinary strength of
