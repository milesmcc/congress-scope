Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, in the other body yesterday, under the 
leadership of Senator Reid, the gentleman from New Hampshire, Senator 
Gregg, had a resolution supporting the funding of our troops, and the 
Senate leadership prevented that resolution from being brought to the 
floor under regular order because they wanted first to bring a 
resolution condemning the President.

Now the Speaker of the House has announced that next week we will 
have a resolution brought to the floor of this body condemning the 
President's plan for a new way forward in Iraq.

I challenge the Speaker and the Democratic leadership, if that 
resolution is on this floor, to bring forward also the resolution of a 
true war hero, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, supporting the 
continued funding of the troops in Iraq.

We have heard Members on the other side of the aisle continue to say 
we can and will, if necessary, cut off funding. This will give them an 
opportunity to put their money where their mouth is.
