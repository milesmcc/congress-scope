`Mr. WHITEHOUSE â€” 16 February 2007`

---


Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of thousands of Rhode 
Islanders who have talked with me about the need for a new direction in 
Iraq and the need to bring our troops home.

I speak on behalf of the veterans' families who traveled here to 
Washington to speak to me about their memories of war and the need for 
this one to end.

I speak on behalf of the brave men and women serving in Iraq who have 
sacrificed so much and whose families anxiously await their return.

I speak on behalf of mothers I met who felt they had to buy body 
armor for their sons and daughters headed for Iraq because they could 
not trust this administration to provide what was needed.

The Senate may have been muzzled in recent days, but Rhode Islanders 
certainly have not been. More than 2,000 of them have reached out to my 
office in frustration, in anger, and in concern--and in the hope that 
this new Democratic Senate will listen to them and hear them, as this 
administration will not.

I want to share some of what they have written me:




 I was at Michael Weidemann's funeral.


Mr. President, Michael was a 23-year-old Army sergeant from Newport, 
killed in an IED blast in Anbar Province last November.

The letter continues:




 Please, if nothing else, take care of things, so that we do 


 not have to go through what we went through at that funeral. 


 Michael and my son . . . were in the JROTC together. . . . He 


 is on his second tour of Iraq. Please, don't make yesterday a 


 dress rehearsal for me. I want my son to come home, safely.


From Johnston, Rhode Island:




 My son . . . is presently serving in Iraq and on his second 


 tour of duty there. . . . The President's plan ignores the 


 American people who voted for change in November, and who 


 continue to demand we bring our troops home. . . . The 


 people made their voice heard, and if the President isn't 


 going to listen, the Democratic Congress will. The 


 President's policies have failed!


From Portsmouth, Rhode Island:




 President Bush has ignored the advice of experience, lied 


 to us all, lacked any plan and seems to be expecting his 


 successor to solve the problems. It is our only hope that 


 you, as a member of Congress, can work toward bringing our 


 troops home soon.


From Kingston:




 I am appalled at the loss of life--today it was reported 20 


 more service people were killed. The Kurds are deserting 


 rather than fight in Baghdad. . . . We are not just losing 


 people, we are losing big money. We have seven grandchildren. 


 What kind of debt are we placing on those future generations?


From Warwick:




 We never should have begun this war, let's now have the 


 sense to end it, not prolong it. Please do whatever you can 


 to stop the president's initiative to increase our military 


 presence in Iraq. . . . , to spend even more money waging a 


 war that your constituents have indicated they no longer 


 support.


From North Kingstown:




 We are looking to you to do whatever is in your power to 


 stop the U.S. escalation of troops in Iraq. I and many in our 


 nation feel this will only make a bad situation worse, widen 


 what is essentially a civil war and lead to further 


 casualties and costs without contributing towards a political 


 solution. . . . We are counting on you and your colleagues on 


 both sides of the aisle to stand up and be counted and forge 


 a bipartisan solution to end this war.


And finally, a woman from Cumberland forwarded me a message she sent 
to President Bush:




 My nephew . . . is in the 82nd Airborne serving our country 


 in Iraq. He is the bravest person I have ever known, along 


 with all the other men and women serving this country. I am 


 proud to be an American! Please, please, on behalf of my 


 family and the families of all U.S. troops--bring them home 


 now!


Mr. President, these voices will not be unfamiliar to anyone in this 
body. In every State, we have heard similar voices. You have heard them 
in Colorado, Mr. President. My friend, Senator Sanders, has heard them 
in Vermont. People all across America are speaking to all of us, and it 
is time for us to listen and to show that we have heard and to start to 
bring our soldiers home.

The President has not heard these voices. He wants to send tens of 
thousands more troops to Iraq. He calls this a surge. We consider it a 
grave mistake.

Tomorrow, our vote can stop the parliamentary maneuvers that have 
stalled us, and this great deliberative body can begin to debate the 
most pressing question of this day.

Let's talk for a moment about that question. The other side wishes to 
debate every question, any question--any question but the escalation by 
this President of our troops in Iraq by over 21,000 men and women. But 
this question we want to debate is not a question selected by Democrats 
for political reasons. It is possible here to choose self-serving 
questions and to force a debate on those questions just to make a 
political point. But we have not done that.

This question, whether to escalate the war in Iraq, is not an 
invention of the Democratic Party. It is not an invention of the 
Senate. It is President Bush, who proposed to send tens of thousands 
more troops into harm's way and to escalate this conflict, who has 
presented this question. This question is what was presented to us by 
President George W. Bush, and by him alone, and it is the pressing 
question of today.

For weeks, we on this side of the aisle have emphasized and 
reemphasized our strong commitment to having a real debate--a debate to 
a vote--to telling the American people where we stand and to casting 
our votes on the precise question the President of the United States 
has presented to America. But we have been impeded, obstructed, 
maneuvered away from this critical question.

The other side argues that to dispute this President's judgment is to 
fail to support the troops--even though that judgment has failed the 
troops and has failed our country and has left us with few good 
options.

But that is a false choice, Mr. President. And this hour demands 
better of this institution.

There are ways to accomplish the change America demands, and that 
reason and good conscience dictate. For instance, I believe that rather 
than send a single additional American soldier into the sands and 
marshes of Iraq, this President can announce clearly and unequivocally 
that our troops will be redeployed from Iraq and will soon come home.

The most powerful motivating force at our country's disposal today is 
the prospect of our redeployment out of Iraq. Let me repeat that. The 
most powerful motivating force at our country's disposal today is the 
prospect of redeployment out of Iraq. Using this power wisely, deftly, 
and thoughtfully would accomplish three critical objectives that, as I 
have said, would make great strides toward security in Iraq and 
stability in the region.

First, a clear statement of our intent to redeploy our troops from 
Iraq would eliminate the sense there that we are an Army of occupation. 
This in turn would quiet the nationalist sentiment of the Iraqi people, 
now aroused against us. Many Iraqis are now so opposed to our presence 
they think killing American soldiers is acceptable.

Second, without America's intervening presence, the world community 
would have to face directly the consequences of the situation in Iraq. 
The prospect of our departure would compel the world to take a more 
active role to work together with America to bring peace and stability 
to the region. We


cannot continue as we are now, in every meaningful way completely 
alone.

Third, Iraq's neighbors will be obliged to assume greater 
responsibility for averting the risk of a Sunni-Shiite conflict 
igniting in Iraq and spreading beyond Iraq's borders. Without us in 
Iraq as a police force for a civil war, neighboring nations will have 
an enlivened incentive to avert a wider war.

Finally, the Bush administration's preoccupation with Iraq leaves us 
weakened in our capability to address other obligations around the 
world, from the changing situation in North Korea, to the ongoing 
battle for Afghanistan, to the serious threat posed by Iran's nuclear 
program.

Mr. President, these are serious matters, and they deserve the 
serious and sustained attention of the Senate. I hope tomorrow's vote 
will allow us to bring this question that attention.

Mr. President, I will support that vote tomorrow. I ask other 
Senators, who hear our fellow Americans' genuine and sincere concern 
about our national interest, will do the same.

I will support not only the resolution disapproving of the 
President's escalation plan and supporting our troops, but also other, 
stronger measures that will follow, and that will continue to put 
pressure on this administration to finally bring our troops home.

Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

I yield the floor.
