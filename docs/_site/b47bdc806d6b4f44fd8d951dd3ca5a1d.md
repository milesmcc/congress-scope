Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, just a brief response to the distinguished 
majority leader about motives as to debate on Iraq.

I don't know a Senator who has been clearer or more concise on this 
administration's positions on Iraq than the senior Senator from 
Nebraska. To suggest that some on this side are impeding or trying to 
protect the Bush administration's policy on Iraq, specifically 
escalating our military involvement in Iraq, is a bit off the mark.

The fact is, the minority leader is very clear in his purpose. I have 
supported that. Minority rights are the essence, the foundation of this 
body. The minority should have an opportunity to present their 
resolution or resolutions. It should not be dictated to by the 
majority.

Make it very clear, those on this side who have pushed for this 
debate are very clear in our position. I doubt if there is anyone who 
has been clearer than this Senator.

I yield the floor.
