Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding.

In a few minutes the President will address the Nation about his 
plans for Baghdad and the fact that he needs reinforcements, some of 
them to go to Anbar Province, some of them to work on a three-to-one 
basis with the Iraqi forces, three Iraqi battalions in each one of 
these sectors in Baghdad for each American battalion standing behind 
them.

The President has asked for reinforcements, and it would be 
outrageous if the Democrat leadership in this House denied this country 
reinforcements for a military operation in a shooting war which 
continues to this minute.
