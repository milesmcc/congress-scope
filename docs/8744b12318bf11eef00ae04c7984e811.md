Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Mr. Ellison, for your great leadership on The 
Progressive Message, which is the message of average, normal American 
people, and we know it. And we are proud to speak it, because there is 
nothing like the issues that we stand for with the Progressive Caucus, 
our progressive promise, that hits home to the American people like 
what we are promising to work on.

Tonight, we are going to talk about our Earth, I believe. Thank you 
for bringing that to us.

But also thank you for recognizing my, I believe, 309 5-minute 
speeches on the floor regarding Iraq and peace in general, and 
Afghanistan, now that we are looking like we don't know when we are 
going to get out of there.

We can talk about saving the Earth, but if we destroy it with war, 
then we won't have an Earth to save. So thank you for doing this 
tonight.
