Mr. KUCINICH. It is good our administration is reaching out to the 
Muslim world. It is bad to spend another $100 billion to keep wars 
going which will kill innocent Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
Pakistan.

It is good we try to create an incentive for people to buy efficient 
cars. It is bad that vouchers will not be expressly for the purpose of 
purchase of cars made in America. It is even worse that we tie such an 
incentive to a war-funding bill: cash for clunkers and bunkers in the 
same bill; cash for more war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cash 
to help China sell its cars to Americans.

Meanwhile, back in the U.S. of A., factories and auto dealers are 
closing. People are losing their businesses, their jobs, their homes, 
their health care, their investments, their retirement security.

Who are these people who keep coming up with these innovative ideas 
to keep wars going and to move jobs out of America? Who are these 
people?
