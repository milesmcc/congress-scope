Mr. MURTHA. I want the Members to know I carry in my pocket the names 
of 18 people who have been killed from my district. Two years ago, I 
said this is a failed policy wrapped in illusion. I am absolutely 
convinced that there's more instability in the Middle East today than 
there was then.

This recommittal motion works against everything we are trying to do. 
We want a plan. We want a plan in Iraq. We want stability in the Middle 
East. We don't have stability. Pakistan, Afghanistan, and of course 
Turkey might even go into the Middle East. So when you talk about 
victory, you're talking about stability, which we don't have. It's 
absolutely essential to put a plan in place that holds the President 
accountable.

All this time the President has asked for things and we have given 
them to him. For 5 years we have said to the President of the United 
States, You need money, we are going to give to it you. Now we are 
saying we are going to have a new plan, and that plan is going to 
change the direction of this war, and we are going to bring those 
troops who fought so honorably home to their families.
