Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Chairman, I rise to support this amendment. I 
commend Congresswoman Giffords for her tireless work on this issue, and 
commend both the Chair and ranking member for accepting the amendment.

The Small Business Innovative Research program increases small 
businesses' participation in federally funded research and development. 
It is a proven program. It is an effective program.

Since 1983, more than 94,000 projects have received more than $20 
billion in awards, keeping our Nation competitive in the global 
marketplace and helping our small businesses thrive. But in order for 
this program to have its full impact, there must be that level playing 
field, and those who try and cheat the system must not be allowed to 
reap the benefits.

This amendment simply says that to receive a Small Business 
Innovation Research award, a small business must be domiciled in the 
United States. You must play by the rules. Today, even contractors 
supporting our own military in Iraq continue to filter Federal dollars 
through offshore shell companies to avoid paying taxes here. Every 
year, offshore tax shelters cost taxpayers nearly $100 billion. No one, 
contractors, small businesses or otherwise, no one who looks for 
special privileges under our tax system should be able to take 
advantage of the opportunities offered by the Federal Government.

I thank my colleague and the committee for offering this well 
thought-out and necessary amendment to the bill, and urge its adoption 
and appreciate its being accepted by the Chair and ranking member.
