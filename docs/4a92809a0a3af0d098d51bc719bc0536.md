Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
disappointment that the provision I drafted, that would prohibit 
private security contractors from performing inherently governmental 
functions in combat areas, was stripped from this bill. The House 
unanimously adopted this provision, and the Senate bill contained a 
nearly identical provision.

I am extremely disappointed that the Bush administration threatened 
to veto this bill over this commonsense provision, forcing the Armed 
Services Committee to only include a sense of Congress on the use of 
private military contractors in this legislation.

The horrible incidents like that involving Blackwater Worldwide in 
which 17 Iraqi civilians were killed, for which no one has yet been 
held accountable, have damaged our already tattered image in the eyes 
of the Iraqi people. Private contractors are being tasked with 
extremely sensitive jobs like gathering intelligence and providing 
armed security, and they severely damage the credibility of our 
military with their sometimes violent and almost always unaccountable 
behavior.

Inherently government functions should be performed by people in the 
U.S. military or who are U.S. Government personnel, people who proudly 
wear the badge of the U.S. and pledge their allegiance to it.
