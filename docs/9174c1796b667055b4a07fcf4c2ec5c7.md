Mr. LUGAR. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on 
February 6, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs Peter Pace talked about the urgent need for civilian expertise 
in the Iraq stabilization effort. General Pace also called for more 
civilian resources for the broader worldwide effort, people who can 
build judicial and rule of law systems, provide engineering expertise, 
and bring clean water and electricity to people ''before a country 
devolves into a state where the terrorists can find a home.''

Passing the amendment will demonstrate that there is a keen 
understanding in the Senate that we need to move forward now to 
strengthen our civilian reconstruction capabilities in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

I recommend this amendment to my colleagues and urge its adoption.
