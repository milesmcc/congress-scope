Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor Corporal Chad S. Wade, 22, 
of Bentonville, AR, who died December 1 while conducting combat 
operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.

My heart goes out to the family of CPL Wade who made the ultimate 
sacrifice on behalf of our Nation. Along with all Arkansans, I am 
grateful for his service and for the service and sacrifice of all of 
our military servicemembers and their families.

More than 11,000 Arkansans on active duty and more than 10,000 
Arkansas Reservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September 
11, 2001. These men and women have shown tremendous courage and 
perseverance through the most difficult of times. As neighbors, as 
Arkansans, and as Americans, it is incumbent upon us to do everything 
we can to honor their service and to provide for them and their 
families, not only when they are in harm's way but also when they 
return home. It is the least we can do for those whom we owe so much.

Corporal Wade was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 
1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, CA.
