`Mr. NYE â€” 30 April 2009`

Mr. NYE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague from New 
Mexico for his hard work on this amendment and for yielding.

Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to visit two forward-
operating bases in the eastern part of Afghanistan, and it's true our 
troops today can keep in touch with home more easily than ever before. 
But the reality of patrolling the border along Pakistan means that 
sometimes payment dates will be missed.

Quite frankly, our troops deployed overseas have more important 
things to do than worry about a credit score. Their only concern should 
be to complete their missions and come home safely.

The same is true for injured veterans. As service-disabled veterans 
work to readjust to civilian life, they often face serious challenges 
finding a job, going through therapy, and working to recover from their 
injuries. We should do everything in our power to help them recover and 
rebuild. That's what this amendment will do.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and 
supporting our troops overseas and our injured veterans back home.
