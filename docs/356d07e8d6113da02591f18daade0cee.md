Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, you know, it's hard for me to even 
sit here and hear the other side talk about this, because they are 
missing the point. This is about our soldiers. If you care about our 
soldiers, you say you care about our soldiers, you will vote for this 
supplemental.

This supplemental has over $4 billion more than what the President 
asked for in everything. I'll tell you what this supplemental is about. 
It's about those soldiers that I visited in Landstuhl, Germany. On 
three different occasions, every time we went over to Iraq and over to 
Afghanistan we'd make a stop to come back.

You want to know what this supplemental is about? It's about those 
sons and daughters, 19 and 20 years old, who will never walk again with 
their legs because they have been cut off.

You talk about the President wants to veto this. Let's send it to 
him. Let him veto it. If he vetoes this bill that's got the money in it 
for the body armor that he sent troops into battlefield without, let 
him veto this. If he vetoes this bill, it will be like sending a dagger 
right in the heart of our soldiers.
