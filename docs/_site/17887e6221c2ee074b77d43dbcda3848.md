# TOWN HALL BY MAIL SURVEY RESULTS FOR FLORIDA'S 10TH CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT
## `17887e6221c2ee074b77d43dbcda3848`
`Mr. YOUNG of Florida â€” 13 January 2010`

---


Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Madam Speaker, Our nation is faced with more 
major issues, and is more divided over how we should handle those 
issues, than at any time I have served in Congress.

These issues include matters of national security, financial 
security, economic security, and the future of our health care system. 
Last November, I asked residents of the 10th Congressional District I 
have the privilege to represent to share their thoughts with me on 
these and many other pressing issues. To date, more than 31,500 have 
responded to my survey which included 26 questions on a wide range of 
legislative matters. In addition, almost half of those who responded 
provided some very helpful additional comments about other matters of 
interest to them. In order to certify the accuracy of the results, I 
had an outside firm tabulate the surveys before returning them to me to 
review the comments.

Madam Speaker, following my remarks, I will include for the benefit 
of my colleagues the complete results of my Town Hall by Mail survey. 
As we return for the Second Session of this 111th Congress and begin 
debate on these many difficult issues, I think they will find these 
results of special interest.
