Mr. LEE of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon to honor a 
true American hero, U.S. Army Specialist Alan N. Dikcis, a native of 
Wheatfield, New York. Sadly, on March 5, while serving his second tour 
of duty, Specialist Dikcis lost his life when he was struck by a 
roadside bomb in Afghanistan.

Specialist Dikcis enlisted in the Army shortly after graduating from 
Niagara-Wheatfield High School in 2006 and had hoped to spend his 
career serving his country.

He enjoyed spending time outside, whether it was going for a hike or 
riding on his motorcycle or his four-wheeler, and he enjoyed spending 
time with those he loved, his family and his friends. As Specialist 
Dikcis' stepmother recently said, ''Alan loved being in the Army. He 
was proud of his work. He made us proud. He made his daughter proud.''

I ask that the House join me in thanking Specialist Dikcis for his 
honorable service to our great Nation, and I extend our condolences to 
his family and friends, who had Alan taken from them far too soon.
