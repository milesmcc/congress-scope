`Mr. GOHMERT â€” 2 April 2009`

---


Mr. GOHMERT. You know, many in this body think this Nation will go on 
forever. We know no nation will last forever. We are endowed by our 
Creator with certain inalienable rights. But those rights are like any 
inheritance. You only get to have them if people are willing to fight 
and protect them, fighting government and then fight our enemies 
abroad.

Well, in the summer of 2008, media from around the country released 
reports on an attack on an American military outpost base in the Kunar 
province of Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. Accounts say that 45 
U.S. paratroopers and 25 Afghan soldiers were assaulted by up to 500 
Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, bombarding our soldiers with rocket-
propelled grenades and mortars. Nine U.S. soldiers were killed, 15 
injured, and it was called the deadliest attack on American forces in 
Afghanistan since 2005.

I am here today to honor these servicemembers for their incredible 
sacrifice and to especially recognize one in particular who I am so 
very proud and humbled to represent as his U.S. Congressman.



Army Specialist Aaron David Davis, from Kilgore, Texas, was serving 
as an anti-armor gunner of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team and 
was sent in as reinforcement when insurgents assailed our soldiers on 
July 13, 2008.

In the rural town of Wanat, Afghanistan, Specialist Davis and his men 
were bombarded by enemy fire from all sides as insurgents took over 
homes and mosques in their attempts to seize the newly established 
American base there. Specialist Davis and his fellow soldiers were 
vastly outnumbered, but they continued to courageously fight. 
Specialist Davis saw many of his fellow soldiers killed in the midst of 
that chaotic combat and was wounded himself; yet he was not deterred 
from fiercely protecting the base and his friends.

An American military helicopter finally came to the rescue, but even 
after he was told to get on the helicopter that would surely be his 
ticket to safety, a wounded and hurting Davis was more concerned with 
the protection of others. With his own life in peril, he stayed and 
continued to fight.

Among his heroic actions, Specialist Davis crawled to the frontline 
to check on a fellow soldier, and then he helped save three fellow 
soldiers, putting them on gurneys and helping get them airlifted out of 
the ongoing battle. While fighting to protect these men, Davis was 
again wounded, receiving shrapnel in his left hand, left arm, and 
behind his right eye. He became so wounded he finally had to be lifted 
away from the fight himself.

There is so much more to the story, and I wish there were more time 
to elaborate on this young man's incredible selflessness. Aaron Davis 
spend many weeks recovering from his wounds at Walter Reed Army Medical 
Center, and he is now back on active duty at Fort Sam Houston, 
continuing to boldly serve his country while still further 
rehabilitating.

He was recently awarded the Purple Heart for the wounds he suffered, 
as well as the Silver Star, the third highest military decoration that 
can be awarded to a member of any branch of the United States Armed 
Forces, for his incredible courage and unwavering commitment to his 
country and his fellow soldiers. Specialist Aaron Davis deserves our 
thanks for his bold bravery and selfless sacrifice.

It is the courage and commitment of Aaron Davis and his fellow 
soldiers and those like them that allows us to continue to enjoy our 
freedom as U.S. citizens. We are manifestly proud and permanently 
grateful. To Specialist Aaron Davis, may God bless Aaron Davis and he 
and all he has done for this Nation.
