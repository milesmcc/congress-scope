Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, Will Rogers once said, ''If you 
find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is to stop digging.''

My colleagues, the majority now finds itself in a hole, and contrary 
to Will Rogers' advice, it continues to dig. Indeed, this ill conceived 
emergency supplemental is evidence of a majority party in complete 
disarray, unable to develop consensus on supporting American troops, 
and unwilling to work in a bipartisan manner with the minority and the 
President to develop a way forward.

This legislation rations funding to our troops over a 60-day period 
and dishonors the long-term sacrifice and service of our men and women 
in uniform. It is legislation that says to the troops, we support you 
conditionally today, but don't expect Congress to support you 2 months 
from now.

I ask my colleagues, is this the message Congress wants to send to 
our troops?

Is this the message we want to send to al Qaeda?

Is this the best a divided majority can do?



This legislation has caused me and others to question the majority's 
commitment to our troops. No political party has a corner on virtue, 
but the majority's reluctance to fully fund our troops clearly calls 
into question its commitment to our men and women in uniform.

It is no secret that Chairman Obey is a strong supporter of the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a program that receives broad 
bipartisan support. In recent years, Mr. Obey has supported advanced 
appropriations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

Is it an accident that Chairman Obey, who advocates funding Kermit 
the Frog and Clifford the Big Red Dog 2 years at a time, now wants to 
fund our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan 2 months at a time?

What does that say about the majority's commitment to our troops 
during a time of war?

Why is the majority setting our troops up for failure?

Mr. Speaker, it is time that we take funding our troops seriously and 
move beyond the gamesmanship and the partisanship on display today. 
Supporting our men and women in uniform is not a joke or a game. It is 
among the most important responsibilities each of us has as elected 
officials.

I was hopeful when the Speaker emerged from the White House last week 
signaling her willingness to work with Republicans and the President to 
craft a troop funding bill worthy of bipartisan support. Instead, 
Speaker Pelosi has chosen confrontation over cooperation and has 
demonstrated unwillingness to compromise.

Chairman Obey and his leadership have dramatically rewritten the 
Iraqi supplemental bill without any input from the minority, and 
unfortunately, the result will be the same as the last supplemental.

One more time it appears that the majority is more interested in 
appeasing the left than supporting our troops. One more time the House 
is being asked to consider a bill that is going nowhere fast. Even the 
Senate is opposed to this piecemeal approach to funding our troops. One 
more time, the House is preparing to approve a supplemental that the 
President will veto.

Today I am left scratching my head trying to determine which bill is 
worse, the one before us now or the one vetoed by the President last 
week.

Frankly, I believe the bill before us today is considerably worse 
than the measure vetoed last week. I will take a moment or two to 
explain why I think that. Under this proposal, the President is 
required to report by July 13 on the specific progress the Iraqi 
government has made in meeting 16 specific goals.

Once this report is received, only the chairman, only the chairman of 
the Appropriations Committee can introduce a joint resolution to 
release the funds. He is not required to introduce the joint 
resolution, and no other Member can do it.

Secondly, in an almost unprecedented move, this supplemental includes 
the rule under which the joint resolution will be brought to the floor. 
And under this rule, the only amendment made in order is the one that 
mandates the withdrawal of troops from Iraq within 6 months.

Further, this legislation includes a new reporting requirement that 
the President provide a detailed monthly accounting of the combat 
readiness status of Iraqi forces. The supplemental dictates that this 
report be made publicly available at the Department of Defense's Web 
site with a link to the detailed data. As a result, we will provide, 
not only to the public but also our enemies, the detailed readiness 
report and potential vulnerability of Iraqi security forces. We do not 
release this kind of information to our own troops. In fact, we keep it 
classified. Why would we ever mandate that the United States provide al 
Qaeda a blueprint for targeting Iraqi vulnerabilities?

Lastly, this supplemental includes a number of questionable 
legislative provisions otherwise known as earmarks, including a land 
transfer in Pennsylvania and a flood control earmark in New York.

Before closing, I want to express my profound disappointment over 
these emergency supplemental appropriations bills coming to the floor 
again under a closed rule. This is yet another violation of the 
longstanding tradition of the committee and the House.

Mr. Obey's first two bills as chairman, the fiscal year 2007 
continuing resolution and the first Iraqi supplemental, were both 
considered under a closed rule. These will be the third and fourth 
appropriations bills under Mr. Obey's chairmanship brought to the floor 
with a closed rule. It is pretty obvious we do not have very much input 
from the general membership regarding these bills when they are on the 
floor.

I have spoken with Chairman Obey about this concern, and expressed my 
belief that these bills, and all other committee bills, should be 
considered in regular order under an open rule. I say these 
supplemental bills, because my friend, Chairman Obey, and his 
leadership have decided to split the ag, disaster, wild fire, rural 
schools and salmon relief funding into another bill that will be 
considered either later this evening or maybe even tomorrow.

Following consideration of both bills, the majority is apparently 
planning to wave a magic wand in a feat that would make even Houdini 
proud to merge them into one single package as it heads over to the 
other body.

Albert Einstein was correct when he said, and I quote, ''You cannot 
simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.''

The bottom line is this, the majority cannot have it both ways. The 
majority cannot say it supports the troops as it pulls the plug on 
funding. You either support the troops or you do not.

My colleagues, let us not signal that America is preparing to walk 
away. Let us not send the wrong message to America, to our troops, let 
alone to al Qaeda.

We must provide our full and unconditional support to our troops 
during this time of war. We must support our commanders in the field. 
We must support the President, our commander in chief.

I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on this piecemeal, ill-
conceived approach to funding our troops.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
