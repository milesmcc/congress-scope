Mr. HOYER. I don't think the same would be because of both the Senate 
and the House. I'm hopeful that we will pass the supplemental through 
the House, but it won't be in the same position because we haven't had 
a conference on the supplemental. The Senate is working on a bill, as 
the gentleman knows. We're working on a bill. I have talked to the 
chairman, and he is trying to get the matter together for the 
committee. And I am hopeful that we will pass it through the House. My 
urging is that we pass it through the House prior to the Memorial Day 
break. But, obviously, the gentleman knows we will not have effected a 
conference by that time. But we want to do so very shortly because, 
clearly, we need to make sure the resources are available for our men 
and women in harm's way in both Iraq and Afghanistan and in other 
troubled spots of the world.
