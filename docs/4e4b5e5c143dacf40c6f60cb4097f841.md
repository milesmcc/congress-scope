`Mr. HASTINGS of Washington â€” 28 February 2007`

Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman 
from Massachusetts for making his remarks. For a minute I thought he 
was making an argument about the debate we had last week regarding the 
Iraq resolution where we were asking for an open debate.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 2 minutes to my friend from 
Illinois (Mr. Manzullo).
