`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 12 July 2007`

---


Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before I speak on the amendment 
concerning the withdrawal from Iraq offered by Senator Levin, I would 
like to make a few comments about the benchmarks report required by the 
supplemental bill that was signed in May and released by the President 
just this morning.

We knew when the Senate passed the conference report that according 
to the legislation we were requiring a benchmark report in July and a 
benchmark report in September. Why were these dates important? First, 
we knew that July was important because the Baghdad security plan is 
now fully manned, something that was achieved less than 1 month ago.

Congress wanted to send a clear signal to the Iraqi Government that 
full cooperation and sacrifice in executing the Baghdad security plan 
was imperative and that the hard work of political compromise must 
begin. We have done that.

Second, General Petraeus informed the Senate that he and Ambassador 
Crocker would provide an assessment of the counterinsurgency plan to 
the President, as we all know, in September. Having heard that, the 
Senate thought it reasonable that we would be provided the same 
assessment and that we could form a reasoned legislative response to 
that report.

What have we learned? We have learned that progress is mixed, that 
many of our military tasks assigned to the military have been achieved, 
and that we have not seen sufficient progress on the political 
benchmarks. The Congress decided in May that 1 month of a fully manned 
surge was an insufficient period to call the Petraeus plan a success or 
a failure. Certainly, the young soldiers and marines risking their 
lives today on the streets of Baghdad and Ramadi would agree, and they 
deserve our patience.

Some of our colleagues have quite reasonably refrained from drafting 
new amendments that would revisit the actions taken by this Senate back 
in May until they have at least reviewed the benchmarks report 
delivered just today.

I would encourage my colleagues to review the report, as I intend to, 
and to hear what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have to say in 
September. There is much at stake and, frankly, they deserve to be 
heard.















 Amendment No. 2087


Now on another matter, Mr. President, the Senate will soon take up 
the Levin amendment. But before we do, I think it is important that we 
take a look at what it says.

The Levin amendment says:




 The Secretary of Defense shall commence the reduction of 


 the number of United States forces in Iraq not later than 120 


 days after the date of enactment of the enactment of this 


 Act.


Now, exactly what would this reduction involve--10,000 troops, 
20,000, 50,000, all of them? Can we at least get maybe a ballpark 
figure? The Levin amendment does not quite give us one. It only says 
U.S. forces will have a ''limited presence'' after this reduction. What 
is a ''limited presence''?

Does it mean limiting our presence in Al Anbar, which everyone agrees 
has been a stunning success in our fight against al-Qaida? Does it mean 
limiting our presence in Baghdad? In the


Kurdish areas to the north? What does ''limited presence'' mean? The 
Levin amendment does not say. We are left to guess.

The Levin amendment says the members of our Armed Forces will only be 
free to protect the United States and coalition personnel and 
infrastructure, to train Iraqi security forces, and to engage in 
targeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida. What does 
''targeted'' mean? The Levin amendment does not tell us.

It says:




 The Secretary of Defense shall complete the transition of 


 United States forces to a limited presence and missions by 


 April 30.


But how will we know when he has completed the transition? And how 
many forces would have to be moved in order for the Secretary of 
Defense to comply with the bill's mandate to complete it? The amendment 
is silent on that question as well.

If there were more to this amendment, I might have more questions, 
but there is not. That is it. The supposedly groundbreaking policy 
shift that the Democratic majority has been circling around is nothing 
more than a page and a half of vague policy proposals; in fact, an 
empty shell. Do they really expect us to send this to conference and to 
see what might happen? That is wise war policy? That is a responsible 
alternative to the current policy? That is the alternative they give us 
to the Petraeus plan, a doctrine that has been widely acclaimed as the 
last word on counterinsurgency, which is showing signs of success less 
than a month after it was fully manned?

Look, Democrats and Republicans voted to go into Iraq based on the 
same intelligence the President had. It is dishonest and it is 
unhelpful to turn every debate on this war into a discussion of how and 
why we entered it in the first place.

More than 150,000 American troops are there. They are now fighting 
the same group that attacked and killed thousands of innocent Americans 
on 
9/11, who attacked many others before and since, and who are plotting 
to kill thousands more even as we speak. There is one thing we should 
be concerned about in discussing this war, and it is the one thing we 
never hear about from the other side; that is, inning the fight against 
al-Qaida.

Now, the President has recognized that previous strategy failed to 
focus on the insurgency and al-Qaida. He changed course. Now we are 
fighting them head on with the Petraeus plan. At full manning, this 
strategy has been in place for less than a month. We will get a report 
on its progress in September. What sense does it make to short-circuit 
that strategy right now, especially when the only alternative we are 
getting from the other side is a page and a half of questions.

Yesterday, the spokesman for the Multi-National Force in Iraq gave us 
an update on al-Qaida's operations in Iraq. He reminded us that al-
Qaida members refer to Iraq as their central front. This is al-Qaida 
members who say it is their central front. He told us al-Qaida and its 
affiliates are the greatest source of the spectacular attacks that are 
fueling sectarian violence in Iraq.

He told us that in recent months, more and more Iraqis have started 
to reject al-Qaida and its ideology and are finally fighting back. 
Troops are getting good, actionable intelligence from these people 
which they are using to disrupt al-Qaida networks and safe havens in 
and around Baghdad. He showed us a chart that illustrated some of our 
recent successes against the enemy. Our Armed Forces in Iraq killed or 
captured 26 high-level al-Qaida leaders in May and June alone. Eleven 
of them were emirs who were city or local al-Qaida leaders; seven were 
smuggling foreigners, weapons, and money into Iraq; five were cell 
leaders; and three were leaders of IED networks. Last month, our troops 
uncovered an al-Qaida media hub near Samarra. They have concluded that 
between 80 and 90 percent of suicide attacks in Iraq are carried out by 
foreign-born terrorists who have killed some 4,000 Iraqi citizens just 
over the last 6 months.

These are some of the concrete realities on the ground. This is what 
is actually happening, not what people over here seem to be talking 
about. We are fighting al-Qaida head-on, and we are making progress. 
Would the Levin amendment force us to turn our backs on al-Qaida again? 
We have no idea. It really doesn't say. But it could. That is something 
we should all keep in mind as we begin this debate, whether we are 
willing to go with this or with the Petraeus plan.
