Mr. FEINGOLD.




 Among the needed reforms are measures to improve the 


 transparency of government expenditures and impose taxes on 


 wealthy landowners. Such reforms would reduce the 


 opportunities for corruption among Pakistani political 


 leaders, help to establish a more level political playing 


 field, and help build the confidence of average Pakistanis in 


 their government.


As Admiral Blair's testimony illustrates, militancy in the region 
stems from an incredibly complicated set of problems, few of which are 
amenable to a military solution. Now that the United States is focused 
on its relationship with the civilian government in Pakistan after too 
many years in which we placed all our chips on an unreliable, unpopular 
and undemocratic strongman, we are finally on the right track, trying 
to support the emergence of a legitimate government that, in the long 
run, is more likely to support our counterterrorism goals and provide 
the stability that country needs.

Progress on this front, however, may well be compromised by our 
massive presence in Afghanistan. During a recent Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee hearing, former British foreign service officer, 
Rory Stewart testified that ''U.S. operations in Afghanistan may, in 
fact, contribute to the destabilization of Pakistan.'' Special Envoy 
Holbrooke and Admiral Mullen have also acknowledged to me in 
appearances before the Foreign Relations Committee that there is a 
danger that our operations in Afghanistan will further destabilize 
Pakistan by pushing militants into that country. We must carefully 
consider the alternatives before we pursue a significant escalation in 
Afghanistan that is not likely to fix the governance problems in that 
country or to address the al-Qaida presence in Pakistan, and that could 
further destabilize the entire region.

Over the last 8 years, we have committed tremendous resources in an 
effort to dramatically rework Afghan society. We have doubled our troop 
levels over the past year and, this year alone, we will spend over $50 
billion in that country. This has already become the deadliest year for 
U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Rather than doubling down on a strategy 
with objectives that may well be unachievable, we should focus on 
relentlessly pursuing al-Qaida's network in Pakistan and around the 
world, and set realistic goals for providing civilian assistance to 
legitimate actors within the Afghan and Pakistani governments. My 
amendment asks tough questions about any potential military escalation 
to ensure that we carefully consider the costs of the proposed 
strategy, its likelihood of achieving our counterterrorism goals, the 
potential pitfalls and the alternatives. I hope my colleagues will ask 
themselves these questions as they consider whether to support the 
underlying bill, which funds a military approach in Afghanistan that is 
badly in need of rethinking.
