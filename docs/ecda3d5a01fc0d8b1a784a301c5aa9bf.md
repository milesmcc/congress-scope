Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the underlying supplemental appropriations bill. Frankly, I am 
undecided on the rule.

I returned from Afghanistan just a couple of days ago, and I could 
see firsthand the passion and commitment of our servicemen and -women, 
our diplomats and other civilians. But I want them to know that this 
debate that we are having here today is not about them. It is about the 
direction that we need to proceed. I saw the commitment and courage of 
Afghan women to build a future for their country. But this supplemental 
appropriations bill will not get us there. Let me quote, ''Given its 
terrain, poverty, neighborhood and tragic history, Afghanistan in many 
ways poses an even more complex and difficult long-term challenge than 
Iraq, one that, despite a large international effort, will require a 
significant U.S. military and economic commitment for some time.'' 
Those are the words of Secretary Robert Gates, and not my own.

And yet here we are today prepared to commit our servicemen and -
women to a war without end, placing them in harm's way without a plan 
for being there and a strategy for leaving Afghanistan. I understand 
that we want to give our President an opportunity to work out a mess 
that he inherited but did not create. Unfortunately, this Congress and 
this President have to be honest with the American people----
