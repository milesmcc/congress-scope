Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lance 
Corporal Budd M. Cote, who died Monday December 11, 2006, of injuries 
sustained in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Lance Corporal Cote was killed by an explosive device in al-Anbar 
province during combat operations. He was assigned to the Marine Wing 
Support Squadron 373 stationed out of the Marine Corps Air Station in 
Miramar, CA.

Lance Corporal Budd Cote was born in Corona, CA, on June 27, 1985. He 
spent his childhood in the Las Vegas valley before moving to Tucson, 
AZ, where he attended high school.

Lance Corporal Cote was a hero whose desire to serve his country will 
forever make an impact on his family, his community and his country. He 
joined the U.S. Marine Corps to serve his country in the Global War on 
Terror. He will not only be remembered for his sacrifice and willing 
service, but for the extraordinary person that he was. His warmth and 
optimism brightened the lives of his family and friends. He is survived 
by his loving wife, Zoraida, his parents, Marcella and Roland Cote and 
siblings, Alex, Christopher and Tiffany.

Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of Lance Corporal Budd M. 
Cote. Lance Corporal Budd M. Cote made the ultimate sacrifice for his 
country while fighting the War on Terror and defending democracy and 
freedom.
