Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman.

My concern lies in the fact of the reports out of the administration 
today, and perhaps new intelligence information is being relied upon to 
result in a swift turnaround in our policy vis-a-vis Iran which is why 
I raised this question and seek from the gentleman his consistent 
position that has been up until now that we do face a threat in Iran in 
its current capacity.

As the gentleman states, we have uniformed armed men and women in 
Insirlik, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, throughout the region that certainly 
are in the line of Shahab-3 missiles that could do serious harm to 
American life and interests. I think out of that concern, I ask the 
gentleman could we see an expedited push on this bill to demonstrate 
that this Congress, this House, is not yielding to this notion that 
somehow Iran is no longer a threat?

I yield.
