`Mr. McCAIN â€” 7 February 2007`

---


Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I repeat, in case Senator Levin didn't 
hear me, I have criticized the policies and, placed responsibilities on 
the President, the Vice President and the former Secretary of Defense 
for the last 3 years over a failed policy in Iraq. The difference 
Senator Levin and I seem to have is I also hold responsible the 
commanders in the field for giving accurate information, for providing 
recommendations that will help to win a conflict rather than 
subscribing and continuing to this day, to this very day to support a 
policy everyone acknowledges has failed.

By the way, I said today says are failed--not quotes from a month ago 
or


6 months ago or a year ago, I say to my friend from Michigan. No one 
decried those comments, such as ''last throes'' and ''stuff happens'' 
and ''dead enders'' more than I did at the time. But I hold the entire 
chain of command responsible down to the commanders in the field.

He says just a few days ago:




 I don't see it as slow failure. I actually see it as slow 


 progress.


The unclassified NIE we have read, the National Intelligence Estimate 
on Iraq says, ''We are not making progress.'' It says, ''We are 
losing.''

We are going to make the chief of staff of the Army the guy who 
thinks that ''We are making slow progress'' as opposed to the National 
Intelligence Estimate, which is agreed on by our entire intelligence 
establishment, that we are losing. So, of course, we hold people 
responsible. Of course we do. Do I hold our former Secretary of Defense 
responsible? Absolutely. Absolutely. If he were up for another job, I 
would be standing here on the floor objecting to it.

Do I hold others in the administration responsible? Absolutely. But 
this is a leader who is up for an increased responsibility and he has 
failed in his mission, and that is what it is all about. An honorable 
and decent man who has served his country, but the message throughout 
the military now is, unfortunately, as it was with General 
Westmoreland, ''Even though you fail, you are going to be promoted.''

To somehow say the commander in the field is in some way not 
responsible in any way for the ''mistakes'' I think flies in the face 
not only of the record but the tradition we have in the United States 
of America, of placing the commanders in the field in positions of 
responsibility and making them accountable for their performance and 
how they carry out those responsibilities.

I am sure the Senator from Michigan and I will continue to disagree 
for some period of time because we have a philosophical difference, a 
fundamental difference of opinion. If you want to blame everything on 
the civilian leadership, who are of course responsible, who of course 
history will judge very harshly, that is one way of looking at it. If 
you say that responsibility is shared down to the commanders in the 
field, as I do, then you probably have a different view.

I yield the floor.
