Mr. FILNER. The verdict is in, my colleagues. Both the Defense 
Department's health services for returning troops and the Veterans 
Administration are strained to the limit; they are almost to the 
breaking point. For as much money that we give them, we have not 
prepared for the influx of the troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. The 
evidence is clear.

What was happening at Walter Reed that was outlined in the Washington 
Post has, in fact, educated the whole Nation. We have had cover stories 
in the news magazines on how veterans are falling through the cracks. 
There was an incredible documentary on ABC News by Bob Woodruff and how 
his brain injury was treated and how fellow vets had their brain 
injuries treated. And yesterday on CNN we had a story on how Iraqi 
troops returning were homeless already.

We simply have got to meet this test as a Nation. The Democrats are 
trying to do that. We put an additional $3.6 billion into the 
continuing resolution to fund this year to help our troops. And in the 
supplemental we have $3.5 billion for our Nation's troops. It is time 
to support our troops when they come home
