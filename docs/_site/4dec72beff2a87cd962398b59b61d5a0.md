# OIL INDUSTRY MAIN BENEFICIARY OF IRAQ WAR

`Mr. McDERMOTT â€” 11 January 2007`

---


Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the American people have not received 
very much information about a major issue in and around the Iraq war, 
and the oil industry would like to keep it just that way. Fortunately, 
investigative journalism is still being practiced, and I want to share 
information uncovered by a reporter for AlterNet, in the United States, 
and a major Sunday story this week in The Independent, a newspaper in 
the United Kingdom.

The number one Iraq story for all of 2006 on AlterNet, which is an 
Internet-based news and opinion site, was a two-part series by a 
reporter, Joshua Holland, entitled: ''Bush's Petro-Cartel Almost Has 
Iraq's Oil.''

Last Sunday, The Independent carried stories with these headlines: 
''Future of Iraq: The Spoils of War, How the West Will Make a Killing 
on Iraqi Oil Riches.'' And ''Blood and Oil: How the West Will Profit 
from Iraq's Most Precious Commodity.''

Members of Congress are limited in how much information we can enter 
into the record at one time, so I will enter into the record The 
Independent story. I will also encourage every American to seek out and 
read the complete AlterNet story, which is available online.

These investigative reports paint a disturbing picture and raise 
troubling questions about big oil's attempting to steal the oil wealth 
and resources of the Iraqi people. From the beginning of the Iraq 
invasion, more moderate voices, especially overseas, questioned whether 
the ulterior motive behind toppling Saddam Hussein was a grab for Iraqi 
oil. In this scenario, democracy is a by-product of oil production, not 
the real reason for military action in Iraq.

Gaining access to the oil wealth of Iraq has had oil industries 
salivating for years. Gaining control of that oil wealth would be a 
prize beyond compare for the oil industry. Iraq has the third largest 
oil reserves in the world, and there are many oil geologists who 
believe that vast additional oil reserves are just waiting to be 
discovered in Iraq's western desert. They call it the Holy Grail, and 
some believe the untapped riches could propel Iraq from third to first 
place in the world's oil reserves.

An estimated 115 billion barrels of oil reserves are under Iraq. 
Today's price is $53 a barrel, and that is an 18-month low. The 
American people are still suffering from the oil price shocks and


high prices at the pump, and the oil industry is booking record profits 
in the billions of dollars every quarter, record profits in a world 
that is addicted to oil.

In 1999, Vice President Cheney was running Halliburton, and he said 
in a speech that another 50 million barrels of oil would be needed by 
the end of the decade, and the key was the Middle East.

This administration and the British prime minister have repeatedly 
said that the U.S. invasion was not about oil. But these investigative 
reporters say a new law is quietly working its way through the Iraqi 
government that would give unprecedented access, control and oil wealth 
to Western oil companies. It would happen under what is known as a 
production sharing agreement, a PSA.

Here is how The Independent put it: ''PSAs allow a country to retain 
legal ownership of its oil but gives a share of profits to 
international companies that invest in infrastructure and operation of 
the wells, pipelines and refineries.''

The news account continues: ''Their introduction would be a first for 
a major Middle Eastern oil producer. Saudi Arabia and Iran, the world's 
number one and twoexporters, both tightly control their industries 
through state-owned companies with no appreciable foreign 
collaboration, as do most members of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, OPEC.''

The PSA's would give big oil in Iraq deals that would last for 30 to 
40 years. These deals, the news reports point out, would force Iraq to 
share its oil wealth with Western outsiders, not their own people. Up 
to 70 percent of the profits would go to outside producers in the first 
years, and the news media points out that these deals could be enforced 
ahead of any social and economic reforms in Iraq and ahead of any 
social programs. One person quoted called it ''colonialism lite.''

The President said it is not about oil. The prime minister said it is 
not about oil. They said Iraqi oil was for Iraqi people. But the 
legislation working its way through the Iraqi government is about 
nothing but Western access to the oil and its incredible wealth. The 
leaked drafts of the legislation show the West in a role with access 
and control, including a provision in the leaked draft document that 
would enable Western oil companies to transfer their wealth right out 
of Iraq. They don't have to leave it in Iraq at all.

Quoting directly from the leaked draft, ''A foreign person may 
repatriate its exports in accordance with foreign exchange regulations 
in force at the time.'' In fact, the language is so favorable to 
companies that they would be able to take every bit out and sell the 
rest to the world.

A vast amount of Iraq's wealth would be up for sale, by foreigners, 
to foreigners.

Quoting the leaked draft: ''It may freely transfer shares pertaining 
to any non-Iraqi partners.''

The United States has been in Iraq for over 4 years already.

How long will we be there if western oil companies are given free 
rein to put a vice grip on Iraq's oil?

If western oil companies get a 30-year agreement, we may call Iraq 
the 30-year war.

The President said Iraq was all about democracy. News reports now 
give us a picture that say it might have been all about the oil.

Read the news reports and decide for yourself.

I include for the Record the article from The Independent.










[From The Independent, Jan. 7, 2007]


 Blood and Oil: How the West Will Profit From Iraq's Most Precious 















 Commodity




 So was this what the Iraq war was fought for, after all? As 


 the number of US soldiers killed since the invasion rises 


 past the 3,000 mark, and President George Bush gambles on 


 sending in up to 30,000 more troops, The Independent on 


 Sunday has learnt that the Iraqi government is about to push 


 through a law giving Western oil companies the right to 


 exploit the country's massive oil reserves.



 And Iraq's oil reserves, the third largest in the world, 


 with an estimated 115 billion barrels waiting to be 


 extracted, are a prize worth having. As Vice-President Dick 


 Cheney noted in 1999, when he was still running Halliburton, 


 an oil services company, the Middle East is the key to 


 preventing the world running out of oil.



 Now, unnoticed by most amid the furore over civil war in 


 Iraq and the hanging of Saddam Hussein, the new oil law has 


 quietly been going through several drafts, and is now on the 


 point of being presented to the cabinet and then the 


 parliament in Baghdad. Its provisions are a radical departure 


 from the norm for developing countries: under a system known 


 as ''production-sharing agreements'', or PSAs, oil majors 


 such as BP and Shell in Britain, and Exxon and Chevron in the 


 US, would be able to sign deals of up to 30 years to extract 


 Iraq's oil.



 PSAs allow a country to retain legal ownership of its oil, 


 but gives a share of profits to the international companies 


 that invest in infrastructure and operation of the wells, 


 pipelines and refineries. Their introduction would be a first 


 for a major Middle Eastern oil producer. Saudi Arabia and 


 Iran, the world's number one and two oil exporters, both 


 tightly control their industries through state-owned 


 companies with no appreciable foreign collaboration, as do 


 most members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting 


 Countries, Opec.



 Critics fear that given Iraq's weak bargaining position, it 


 could get locked in now to deals on bad terms for decades to 


 come. ''Iraq would end up with the worst possible outcome,'' 


 said Greg Muttitt of Platform, a human rights and 


 environmental group that monitors the oil industry. He said 


 the new legislation was drafted with the assistance of 


 BearingPoint, an American consultancy firm hired by the U.S. 


 government, which had a representative working in the 


 American embassy in Baghdad for several months.



 ''Three outside groups have had far more opportunity to 


 scrutinise this legislation than most Iraqis,'' said Mr. 


 Muttitt. ''The draft went to the U.S. government and major 


 oil companies in July, and to the International Monetary Fund 


 in September. Last month I met a group of 20 Iraqi MPs in 


 Jordan, and I asked them how many had seen the legislation. 


 Only one had.''



 Britain and the United States have always hotly denied that 


 the war was fought for oil. On 18 March 2003, with the 


 invasion imminent, Tony Blair proposed the House of Commons 


 motion to back the war. ''The oil revenues, which people 


 falsely claim that we want to seize, should be put in a trust 


 fund for the Iraqi people administered through the UN,'' he 


 said.



 ''The United Kingdom should seek a new Security Council 


 Resolution that would affirm . . . the use of all oil 


 revenues for the benefit of the Iraqi people.''



 That suggestion came to nothing. In May 2003, just after 


 President Bush declared major combat operations at an end, 


 under a banner boasting ''Mission Accomplished'', Britain co-


 sponsored a resolution in the Security Council which gave the 


 United States and UK control over Iraq's oil revenues. Far 


 from ''all oil revenues'' being used for the Iraqi people, 


 Resolution 1483 continued to make deductions from Iraq's oil 


 earnings to pay compensation for the invasion of Kuwait in 


 1990.



 That exception aside, however, the often-stated aim of the 


 United States and Britain was that Iraq's oil money would be 


 used to pay for reconstruction. In July 2003, for example, 


 Colin Powell, then Secretary of State, insisted: ''We have 


 not taken one drop of Iraqi oil for U.S. purposes, or for 


 coalition purposes. Quite the contrary . . . It cost a great 


 deal of money to prosecute this war. But the oil of the Iraqi 


 people belongs to the Iraqi people; it is their wealth, it 


 will be used for their benefit. So we did not do it for 


 oil.''



 Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Defense Secretary at the time of the 


 war and now head of the World Bank, told Congress: ''We're 


 dealing with a country that can really finance its own 


 reconstruction, and relatively soon.''



 But this optimism has proved unjustified. Since the 


 invasion, Iraqi oil production has dropped off dramatically. 


 The country is now producing about two million barrels per 


 day. That is down from a pre-war peak of 3.5 million barrels. 


 Not only is Iraq's whole oil infrastructure creaking under 


 the effects of years of sanctions, insurgents have constantly 


 attacked pipelines, so that the only steady flow of exports 


 is through the Shia-dominated south of the country.



 Worsening sectarian violence and gangsterism have driven 


 most of the educated elite out of the country for safety, 


 depriving the oil industry of the Iraqi experts and 


 administrators it desperately needs.



 And even the present stunted operation is rife with 


 corruption and smuggling. The Oil Ministry's inspector-


 general recently reported that a tanker driver who paid $500 


 in bribes to police patrols to take oil over the western or 


 northern border would still make a profit on the shipment of 


 $8,400.



 ''In the present state, it would be crazy to pump in more 


 money, just to be stolen,'' said Greg Muttitt. ''It's another 


 reason not to bring in $20bn of foreign money now.''



 Before the war, Mr. Bush endorsed claims that Iraq's oil 


 would pay for reconstruction. But the shortage of revenues 


 afterwards has silenced him on this point. More recently he 


 has argued that oil should be used as a means to unify the 


 country, ''so the people have faith in central government'', 


 as he put it last summer.



 But in a country more dependent than almost any other on 


 oil--it accounts for 70 per cent of the economy--control of 


 the assets has proved a recipe for endless wrangling. Most of 


 the oil reserves in areas controlled by the Kurds and Shias, 


 heightening the fears of the Sunnis that their loss of power 


 with the fall of Saddam is about to be compounded by economic 


 deprivation.



 The Kurds in particular have been eager to press ahead, and 


 even signed some small PSA deals on their own last year, 


 setting off a struggle with Baghdad. These issues now appear 


 to have been resolved, however: a revenue-sharing agreement 


 based on population




 was reached some months ago, and sources have told the IoS 


 that regional oil companies will be set up to handle the PSA 


 deals envisaged by the new law.



 The Independent on Sunday has obtained a copy of an early 


 draft which was circulated to oil companies in July. It is 


 understood there have been no significant changes made in the 


 final draft. The terms outlined to govern future PSAs are 


 generous: according to the draft, they could be fixed for at 


 least 30 years. The revelation will raise Iraqi fears that 


 oil companies will be able to exploit its weak state by 


 securing favourable terms that cannot be changed in future.



 Iraq's sovereign right to manage its own natural resources 


 could also be threatened by the provision in the draft that 


 any disputes with a foreign company must ultimately be 


 settled by international, rather than Iraqi, arbitration.



 In the July draft obtained by The Independent on Sunday, 


 legislators recognise the controversy over this, annotating 


 the relevant paragraph with the note, ''Some countries do not 


 accept arbitration between a commercial enterprise and 


 themselves on the basis of sovereignty of the state. ''



 It is not clear whether this clause has been retained in 


 the final draft.



 Under the chapter entitled ''Fiscal Regime'', the draft 


 spells out that foreign companies have no restrictions on 


 taking their profits out of the country, and are not subject 


 to any tax when doing this.



 ''A Foreign Person may repatriate its exports proceeds [in 


 accordance with the foreign exchange regulations in force at 


 the time].'' Shares in oil projects can also be sold to other 


 foreign companies: ''It may freely transfer shares pertaining 


 to any non-Iraqi partners.'' The final draft outlines general 


 terms for production sharing agreements, including a standard 


 12.5 per cent royalty tax for companies.



 It is also understood that once companies have recouped 


 their costs from developing the oil field, they are allowed 


 to keep 20 percent of the profits, with the rest going to the 


 government. According to analysts and oil company executives, 


 this is because Iraq is so dangerous, but Dr Muhammad-Ali 


 Zainy, a senior economist at the Centre for Global Energy 


 Studies, said: ''Twenty percent of the profits in a 


 production sharing agreement, once all the costs have been 


 recouped, is a large amount.'' In more stable countries, 10 


 percent would be the norm.



 While the costs are being recovered, companies will be able 


 to recoup 60 to 70 percent of revenue; 40 percent is more 


 usual. David Horgan, managing director of Petrel Resources, 


 an Aim-listed oil company focused on Iraq, said: ''They are 


 reasonable rates of return, and take account of the bad 


 security situation in Iraq. The government needs people, 


 technology and capital to develop its oil reserves. It has 


 got to come up with terms which are good enough to attract 


 companies. The major companies tend to be conservative.''



 Dr. Zainy, an Iraqi who has recently visited the country, 


 said: ''It's very dangerous . . . although the security 


 situation is far better in the north.'' Even taking that into 


 account, however, he believed that ''for a company to take 20 


 percent of the profits in a production-sharing agreement once 


 all the costs have been recouped is large''.



 He pointed to the example of Total, which agreed terms with 


 Saddam Hussein before the second Iraq war to develop a huge 


 field. Although the contract was never signed, the French 


 company would only have kept 10 percent of the profits once 


 the company had recovered its costs.



 And while the company was recovering its costs, it is 


 understood it agreed to take only 40 percent of the profits, 


 the Iraqi government receiving the rest.



 Production-sharing agreements of more than 30 years are 


 unusual, and more commonly used for challenging regions like 


 the Amazon where it can take up to a decade to start 


 production. Iraq, in contrast, is one of the cheapest and 


 easiest places in the world to drill for and produce oil. 


 Many fields have already been discovered, and are waiting to 


 be developed.



 Analysts estimate that despite the size of Iraq's 


 reserves--the third largest in the world--only 2,300 wells 


 have been drilled in total, fewer than in the North Sea.



 Confirmation of the generous terms--widely feared by 


 international nongovernment organisations and Iraqis alike--


 have prompted some to draw parallels with the production-


 sharing agreements Russia signed in the 1990s, when it was 


 bankrupt and in chaos.



 At the time Shell was able to sign very favourable terms to 


 develop oil and gas reserves off the coast of Sakhalin island 


 in the far east of Russia. But at the end of last year, after 


 months of thinly veiled threats from the environment 


 regulator, the Anglo-Dutch company was forced to give 


 Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom a share in the 


 project.



 Although most other oil experts endorsed the view that PSAs 


 would be needed to kick-start exports from Iraq, Mr. Muttitt 


 disagreed. ''The most commonly mentioned target has been for 


 Iraq to increase production to 6 million barrels a day by 


 2015 or so,'' he said. ''Iraq has estimated that it would 


 need $20bn to $25bn of investment over the next five or six 


 years, roughly $4bn to $5bn a year. But even last year, 


 according to reports, the Oil Ministry had between $3bn and 


 $4bn it couldn't invest. The shortfall is around $lbn a year, 


 and that could easily be made up if the security situation 


 improved.



 ''PSAs have a cost in sovereignty and future revenues. It 


 is not true at all that this is the only way to do it.'' 


 Technical services agreements, of the type common in 


 countries which have a state-run oil corporation, would be 


 all that was necessary.



 James Paul of Global Policy Forum, another advocacy group, 


 said: ''The U.S. and the UK have been pressing hard on this. 


 It's pretty clear that this is one of their main goals in 


 Iraq.'' The Iraqi authorities, he said, were ''a government 


 under occupation, and it is highly influenced by that. The 


 U.S. has a lot of leverage . . . Iraq is in no condition 


 right now to go ahead and do this.''



 Mr. Paul added: ''It is relatively easy to get the oil in 


 Iraq. It is nowhere near as complicated as the North Sea. 


 There are super giant fields that are completely mapped, 


 [and] there is absolutely no exploration cost and no risk. So 


 the argument that these agreements are needed to hedge risk 


 is specious.''



 One point on which all agree, however, is that only small, 


 maverick oil companies are likely to risk any activity in 


 Iraq in the foreseeable future. ''Production over the next 


 year in Iraq is probably going to fall rather than go up,'' 


 said Kevin Norrish, an oil analyst from Barclays. ''The whole 


 thing is held together by a shoestring; it's desperate.''



 An oil industry executive agreed, saying: ''All the majors 


 will be in Iraq, but they won't start work for years. Even 


 Lukoil [of Russia], the Chinese and Total [of France] are not 


 in a rush to endanger themselves. It's now very hard for U.S. 


 and allied companies because of the disastrous war.''



 Mr. Muttitt echoed warnings that unfavourable deals done 


 now could unravel a few years down the line, just when Iraq 


 might become peaceful enough for development of its oil 


 resources to become attractive. The seeds could be sown for a 


 future struggle over natural resources which has led to 


 decades of suspicion of Western motives in countries such as 


 Iran.



 Iraqi trade union leaders who met recently in Jordan 


 suggested that the legislation would cause uproar once its 


 terms became known among ordinary Iraqis.



 ''The Iraqi people refuse to allow the future of their oil 


 to be decided behind closed doors,'' their statement said. 


 ''The occupier seeks and wishes to secure . . . energy 


 resources at a time when the Iraqi people are seeking to 


 determine their own future, while still under conditions 


 of occupation.''



 The resentment implied in their words is ominous, and not 


 only for oil company executives in London or Houston. The 


 perception that Iraq's wealth is being carved up among 


 foreigners can only add further fuel to the flames of the 


 insurgency, defeating the purpose of sending more American 


 troops to a country already described in a U.S. intelligence 


 report as a cause celebre for terrorism.







 America protects its fuel supplies--and contracts




 Despite U.S. and British denials that oil was a war aim, 


 American troops were detailed to secure oil facilities as 


 they fought their way to Baghdad in 2003. And while former 


 defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld shrugged off the orgy of 


 looting after the fall of Saddam's statue in Baghdad, the Oil 


 Ministry--alone of all the seats of power in the Iraqi 


 capital--was under American guard.



 Halliburton, the firm that Dick Cheney used to run, was 


 among U.S.-based multinationals that won most of the 


 reconstruction deals--one of its workers is pictured, 


 tackling an oil fire. British firms won some contracts, 


 mainly in security. But constant violence has crippled 


 rebuilding operations. Bechtel, another U.S. giant, has 


 pulled out, saying it could not make a profit on work in 


 Iraq.



in just 40 pages, Iraq is locked into sharing its oil with foreign 










investors for the next 30 years




 A 40-page document leaked to the 'IoS' sets out the legal 


 framework for the Iraqi government to sign production-sharing 


 agreement contracts with foreign companies to develop its 


 vast oil reserves.



 The paper lays the groundwork for profit-sharing 


 partnerships between the Iraqi government and international 


 oil companies. It also lays out the basis for co-operation 


 between Iraq's federal government and its regional 


 authorities to develop oil fields.



 The document adds that oil companies will enjoy contracts 


 to extract Iraqi oil for up to 30 years, and stresses that 


 Iraq needs foreign investment for the ''quick and substantial 


 funding of reconstruction and modernisation projects''.



 It concludes that the proposed hydrocarbon law is of 


 ''great importance to the whole nation as well as to all 


 investors in the sector'' and that the proceeds from foreign 


 investment in Iraq's oilfields would, in the long term, 


 decrease dependence on oil and gas revenues.











 the role of oil in iraq's fortunes




 Iraq has 115 billion barrels of known oil reserves--10 per 


 cent of the world total. There are 71 discovered oilfields, 


 of which only 24 have been developed. Oil accounts for 70 per 


 cent of Iraq's GDP and 95 per cent of government revenue. 


 Iraq's oil would be recovered under a production-


 sharing agreement (PSA) with the private sector. These are 


 used in only 12 per cent of world oil reserves and apply 


 in none of the other major Middle Eastern oil-producing 


 countries. In some countries such as Russia, where they 


 were




 signed at a time of political upheaval, politicians are 


 now regretting them.



The $50bn bonanza for U.S. companies piecing a broken Iraq together




 The task of rebuilding a shattered Iraq has gone mainly to 


 U.S. companies.



 As well as contractors to restore the infrastructure, such 


 as its water, electricity and gas networks, a huge number of 


 companies have found lucrative work supporting the ongoing 


 coalition military presence in the country. Other companies 


 have won contracts to restore Iraq's media; its schools and 


 hospitals; its financial services industry; and, of course, 


 its oil industry.



 In May 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), 


 part of the U.S. Department of Defence, created the Project 


 Management Office in Baghdad to oversee Iraq's 


 reconstruction.



 In June 2004 the CPA was dissolved and the Iraqi interim 


 government took power. But the U.S. maintained its grip on 


 allocating contracts to private companies. The management of 


 reconstruction projects was transferred to the Iraq 


 Reconstruction and Management Office, a division of the U.S. 


 Department of State, and the Project and Contracting Office, 


 in the Department of Defence.



 The largest beneficiary of reconstruction work in Iraq has 


 been KBR (Kellogg, Brown & Root), a division of U.S. giant 


 Halliburton, which to date has secured contracts in Iraq 


 worth $13bn (7bn), including an uncontested $7bn 


 contract to rebuild Iraq's oil infrastructure. Other 


 companies benefiting from Iraq contracts include Bechtel, the 


 giant U.S. conglomerate, BearingPoint, the consultant group 


 that advised on the drawing up of Iraq's new oil legislation, 


 and General Electric. According to the U.S.-based Centre for 


 Public Integrity, 150-plus U.S. companies have won contracts 


 in Iraq worth over $50bn.
