Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I recall March 6, 2003. I came to this floor and spent 
an hour and outlined the 17 resolutions before the United Nations in 
which Saddam Hussein continued his open defiance. That is what was also 
discussed. So what is lost from this debate is Saddam Hussein's 
recalcitrance unto the world. As a veteran of the Gulf War, that was 
ended by a ceasefire, where Saddam Hussein did not uphold his end of 
that agreement.

To the last speaker, he spoke about the political and economic, but 
in order for an infancy government to be able to survive, you have to 
be able to establish its political apparatus, you have to be able to 
give it its economic goals and a means to achieve them, but you also 
need to establish security.

Therein lies the President's plan. He met with the leaders of Iraq 
and he got some concessions from Iraq. ''In fact, you will take the 
lead, you will work with your parliament, you will achieve these 
political and economic goals as we work together to establish your 
security.'' That is the plan.

The Democrats only want to focus on one small portion of the plan, 
which is called a surge, which is disrespectful to the plan. But it 
makes good politics, and that is what is disheartening to me.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. 
Schmidt).
