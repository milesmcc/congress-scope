Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I often say that the opportunity 
to serve on Veterans' Affairs Committee is one of the greatest 
privileges I have been given in my short time in Congress. The action 
on the floor of the House today is another reminder of how it is truly 
an honor to serve on this Committee. Earlier this afternoon the House 
passed several pieces of legislation to improve outreach and care to 
our nation's veterans.



Memorial Day is the day for Americans to officially honor the heroes 
who have fallen in service to our country, and a day to pray for and 
remember the brave souls who have given the ultimate sacrifice. We are 
the beneficiaries of those who serve and who have served to preserve 
the peace and freedom we enjoy.

As a nation, we honor the bravery of those who have fought and died 
for our country and recognize the tremendous sacrifices they and their 
families have made. But to truly honor these heroes it is our duty as a 
grateful nation to not just spend the day remembering their service, 
but to provide the promised support and benefits to the soldiers and 
veterans who served with and followed them. These bills help provide 
that support.

H.R. 67, the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act, creates a grant 
program to allow the VA to partner with State and county veteran 
organizations to reach out to veterans and their families to ensure 
they are aware of their eligibility for benefits.

This bipartisan bill also increases acountability in spending 
taxpayer dollars by requiring reports on how the grants in this program 
have been used to improve outreach. I am proud to be a cosponsor of 
this bill and am pleased it has passed the House.

H.R. 612 is an extremely important piece of legislation. This bill 
will extend access to VA Healthcare for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans 
from two years to five years. This is vital to the health of our 
veterans returning from Iraq because of the nature of Traumatic Brain 
Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

In some cases, TBI and PTSD symptoms do not emerge until several 
years after the injury occurred. With the current freeze on Category 8 
veteran enrollment in VA healthcare, this means that some OIF/OEF will 
realize they suffered a brain injury while deployed but be locked out 
of the system.

They might not have health insurance to cover their treatment, and 
will not have crucial medical documents that will help them receive 
disability benefits.

By expanding their eligibility for 3 additional years, Congress is 
acting to limit the damage done by the President's Category 8 veterans 
enrollment freeze. I was proud to also cosponsor this legislation.

Another extremely important bill to our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans 
is H.R. 2199, the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long 
Term Support Act.

TBI is the signature injury of the war in Iraq and this bill vastly 
improves the VA's ability to provide care for brain injury.

This bill requires the VA to establish a program to screen veterans 
for TBI and establish a program of long term care for acute TBI 
victims.

Currently, of the nearly 1,300 VA health care facilities in the 
United States, only 4 have specialized TBI programs. This bill allows 
the VA to partner with private facilities to provide treatment the VA 
cannot immediately provide.

It also establishes centers of research and a national database so we 
can better understand the causes and symptoms of TBI. Hopefully, this 
will allow us to better treat victims in the future. This bill contains 
provisions of H.R. 1944, a bill I originally cosponsored.

H.R. 1470 expands chiropractic care to all VA facilities throughout 
the country by 2011. During a subcommittee hearing on returning Iraq 
and Afghanistan veterans, several OIF veterans suggested that back 
injuries will be a long term problem for this generation of veterans. 
This bill will help the VA better prepare for this new wave of 
patients.

I am proud that these bills passed the House today and that I could 
support their passage.

Congress has a responsibility to live up to our promises to our 
veterans. Today was another down payment on fulfilling these promises.

Through my role on the Veterans Affairs Committee, I pledge to 
continue to push for legislation that will improve services for our 
veterans and treat them with the respect they have worked so hard to 
earn.
