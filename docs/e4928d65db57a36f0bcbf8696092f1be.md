Mr. HUNTER. I am talking about the armor issue. The point that I made 
is the idea of coming to the floor and implying that somehow there was 
bad faith in this government for not having the new body armor that our 
troops presently have to the tune of 400,000 sets, that somehow that 
was a dereliction of duty is also a disservice, not only to the former 
Congresses, but also to the former administrations. Because the last 
administration in the year 2000 had zero sets of body armor.

Body armor is a new advent, it is a new system. We now have hundreds 
of new systems that we have injected into the warfighting theater. So 
the idea that we had a ragtag military moving across the berm into Iraq 
is also not accurate.

And I would hope that the gentleman would admonish his colleagues who 
come to the floor who imply that our people went across that berm 
unequipped is also not accurate. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
