`Mr. BURTON of Indiana â€” 8 October 2009`

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, we all support our troops. I 
don't think anybody doubts that. So why are we adding a hate crimes 
amendment to this bill? Why are we doing social engineering on the 
backs of our troops on a defense bill? I think it is being done for 
political purposes. I think that there are people on the other side 
that want to put Republicans in a political trick bag in the next 
election, and I think that is very unfortunate.

We should be worrying about the defense of this Nation and the men 
and women fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq today. We should not be 
doing social engineering on this bill. It is just wrong. I think it is 
being done for political purposes. I just say to my colleagues on the 
other side who are doing it, shame on you.
