Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of H.R. 4156 
because people in Wisconsin want their country back.

This bill supports our troops and demands the President begin to move 
our forces away, away from Iraq and back after our real enemies, Osama 
bin Laden and his followers.

Iraq will forever be President Bush's war, an unnecessary war based 
on lies and deceptions. His poor judgment has written perhaps the 
saddest chapter in our Nation's history, wearing down our military and 
the endless, centuries-old Iraqi civil war.

The vote today will end not the hatred between the Shiites and 
Sunnis, but it will redirect our efforts away from Iraq as soon as 
humanly possible. A ''yes'' vote supports our troops by protecting them 
from a President who does not understand reality.

People in Wisconsin have asked me to deliver their message here, here 
on the House floor: I want my country back. I want my country back. 
Tonight, we will begin to move our country in a new direction, away 
from Iraq and back after Osama bin Laden and his followers.
