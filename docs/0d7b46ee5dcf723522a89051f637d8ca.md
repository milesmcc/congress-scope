Description of Request: To provide $10 million in funding to continue 
the development of integrated Aviation tools and provide this ability 
to all Army Aviation systems to include UH-60 series, OH-58D, AH-64D), 
Fixed Wing and UAS systems. The complete integrated aviation solution 
includes implementing the automated maintenance test flight tool, 
automated weight and balance software, and integration with current 
logistics and Aviation Mission Planning systems. These products are 
urgently needed by combat units in Operation Enduring Freedom and 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, and will result in significant increases in 
mission effectiveness and safety for our warfighters. These tools will 
be used by our military's aircraft operators to greatly improve their 
effectiveness and situational awareness, which will improve support to 
the warfighter from materiel developers.
