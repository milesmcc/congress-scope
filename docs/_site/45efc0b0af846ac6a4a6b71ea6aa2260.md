Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I want to agree with my colleague from 
Ohio that we need a course correction in international and domestic 
policy.

As Congress prepares to debate a nonbinding resolution on Iraq, this 
administration is already on its way to the next war against Iran. We 
are losing our democracy to war and to debt. We are borrowing money 
from China, from Korea and Japan to fight a war in Baghdad and to 
prepare for war against Iran.

Meanwhile here at home, there are so many people that lack access to 
adequate health care, who do not have money for housing or education. 
We do not have money for job creation, but we have money for war. It is 
time to stand up for the American people. It is time for Congress to 
assume its full power under the Constitution. It is time to impose some 
discipline on this administration. It is time for Congress to truly be 
a coequal branch of government and to do the work for the American 
people.
