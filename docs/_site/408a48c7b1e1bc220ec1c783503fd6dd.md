`Mr. ROTHMAN â€” 18 June 2007`

Mr. ROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is afraid that because at an 
anti-Zionism ''World without Zionism'' conference, Ahmadinejad said, 
''Wipe Israel off the map.'' We are quibbling over whether he said on 
another occasion, wipe the Israel regime, Zionist regime off the map 
and on a third occasion said, the world would soon see the destruction 
of Israel. The gentleman thinks there is ambiguity there.

This is a regime in Iran sending troops and equipment, killing our 
soldiers in Iraq, building nuclear weapons, threatening to kill our 
number one ally, the State of Israel, and he doesn't want the U.N. to 
look into it to condemn them? I think the gentleman is wrong.
