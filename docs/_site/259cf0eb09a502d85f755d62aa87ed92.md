`Mr. ROGERS of Michigan â€” 17 October 2007`

Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. I want to commend Mr. Hastings. We have 
worked on many issues of which we have agreed strongly in the 
betterment of national security. I couldn't more strongly disagree with 
this bill and where we are going today.

As one of the very few people on this floor that has actually gone 
out and developed sources and developed the leads that you possibly 
need to develop probable cause as a former FBI agent to either bug or 
intercept phones, offices, or other privileges communications between 
Americans, I can tell you the long and arduous process it takes to 
develop that, to go to the judge and say, Your Honor, I do believe that 
these people are engaged in criminal activities and here is why. And it 
takes months and months and months. So let me tell you what this bill 
does today that is so disturbing.

Non-United States citizens who are insurgents in Iraq building IEDs 
that our troops are trying to intercept electronically are now given 
more rights to privacy than we do for gamblers, degenerate gambling 
operations developed under the criminal code in the United States of 
America. That, my friends, is true. Incidental communications, you 
don't have to go back to the judge, you continue to listen. But what we 
have done is we have set a standard that every time they want to go 
overseas and intercept these folks, the standard of the bar is set so 
high they have to go get a court order. They have to get a warrant. And 
it takes months.

This isn't about Hollywood. This isn't about Jack Bauer. This is 
about


real people having to develop probable cause in accordance with the law 
of the United States. And what you said is that insurgent in Iraq has 
more privacy rights than any criminal, any United States citizen under 
the criminal code of the United States of America. That is what you 
have done with this bill. Oh, yes, sir, it is. Read the language and 
understand what it takes for them to go through the process to develop 
probable cause.

This is the confusion that led to the delay that may have cost the 
lives of United States soldiers. We all know the example of which we 
are talking about.

This bill encourages that confusion and that standard to give foreign 
terrorists in a foreign land more privacy rights than United States 
citizens under the criminal code here. It's wrong.

We often say, listen to the intelligence community, listen to our 
commanders on the ground. I implore you to do just that. They oppose 
this bill because it makes it harder for them to go after foreign 
terrorists in foreign lands plotting to kill either U.S. soldiers or 
even attacks against our homeland or our allies. This bill does all of 
those things.

I don't ever doubt the intention of my friends, but words matter in 
the legal code. And when you stand before that judge, believe me, there 
is no agent that believes they are Jack Bauer and are going to fudge a 
little bit on what the Constitution asks and tells them they must do. 
They are going to err on the side of the United States Constitution 
every time. And for those who don't, they deserve to go to jail, and we 
do prosecute those occasionally. But what you are saying is we are 
going to create this whole system for foreign terrorists to give them 
more rights than the privacy of United States citizens. I strongly urge 
the rejection of this bill. Let's go back to the table and protect our 
United States citizens.
