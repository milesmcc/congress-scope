Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to yield myself 15 seconds to make a 
response to that last point.

My last point wasn't that Lebanon is California or New York or 
Massachusetts. My last point was that the free elections in Iraq 
inspired the Lebanese to work to eject the Syrian influence, which I 
think the gentleman would agree was not a good influence in Lebanon. It 
inspired people to want to be free.
