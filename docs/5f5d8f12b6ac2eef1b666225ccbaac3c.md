Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to note in the 
Record that I mistakenly voted ''aye'' on Roll Call 632, that was H.R. 
2368, the Consolidated Security Disaster Assistance and Continuing 
Appropriations Act of 2009. I mistakenly voted ''aye'' on H.R. 2368. I 
did not realize the Defense appropriation and funding for the war in 
Iraq was included in the continuing appropriation. Had I known, I would 
have voted ''no.''
