Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, in listening to this debate, I 
think the biggest problem is the proponents of the stay-the-course plan 
in Iraq continually and completely equate the battle in Iraq with the 
battle against al Qaeda and the terrorists who struck us. The two are 
not the same. In fact, we heard from Ms. Ros-Lehtinen that Iraq is but 
one of the battlefields that we are fighting against al Qaeda. That is 
absolutely true. Yet we have 80 percent of our assets in Iraq. 
Meanwhile, report after report come out that al Qaeda is strengthening 
themselves in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where we don't have enough 
resources.

Our argument is not for retreat. Our argument is that there is a 
better way to fight al Qaeda and those who threaten us than to put all 
of our assets in Iraq while not paying enough attention to where al 
Qaeda is really strengthening itself. In Iraq, it is primarily a power 
struggle in which al Qaeda is a player. It is not primarily about al 
Qaeda's threat against the U.S. In Afghanistan, with the Taliban and al 
Qaeda, it is a very different story.

Our troops, our assets, the lives and the talents of the people of 
this country are tied down in Iraq fighting what is primarily a civil 
war instead of better fighting al Qaeda. In fact, our presence, in many 
ways, has strengthened al Qaeda. Syria would never be an ally of al 
Qaeda in any sort of real-world scenario, because al Qaeda wants to 
topple their regime. Yet to defeat us in Iraq, they have come up with 
an alliance of convenience.

There is a better way to fight al Qaeda. We are here today to change 
course in Iraq because it is a better way to protect this country. 
Timing isn't the issue. Six months ago, these facts were basically the 
same as they are today. In September, these facts will be basically the 
same as they are today. We cannot wait if we are going to have the best 
possible strategy for defeating al Qaeda, the group that threatens us 
most, instead of getting bogged down in the civil war and in the tribal 
differences that are present in Iraq. We want to win, not to quit. This 
is the better way to do it.
