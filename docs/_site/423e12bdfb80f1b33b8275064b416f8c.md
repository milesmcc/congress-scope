On Tuesday next, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour 
business and 10 a.m. for legislative business.

On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for

related to corruption in Iraq; H.R. 2095, the Federal Railroad Safety 
Improvement Act; and H.R. 2102, the Free Flow of Information Act.

On Friday, there will be no votes in the House.
