Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, there is a very important debate 
occurring in our country right now regarding our position towards the 
commitment we've made in Afghanistan. And it's clear that the 
Republicans believe, as I'm sure the gentleman does, that this Congress 
must be devoting attention to this important issue as it relates to the 
national security of the United States and our interests in that arena, 
as well as abroad. And I'd like to ask the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, 
whether he, in his leadership, will call on General McChrystal to 
testify before Congress as soon as possible. And I'd note, as the 
gentleman well knows, that Chairman Skelton has been reported to have 
made such requests of his leadership.
