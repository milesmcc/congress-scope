Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 327, the 
Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, which will expand 
suicide-prevention services to our nation's veterans.

Joshua Omvig was an Army Reservist who committed suicide in 2005 
after serving his


Nation in Iraq. My thoughts and prayers are with the family of this 
fallen hero, who have responded to this tragedy by championing efforts 
to improve mental health care for returning war veterans.

It is widely understood that suicide among veterans suffering from 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and pressing problem 
facing our veterans' community. Our Nation's men and women returning 
from service abroad deserve the highest quality care that this Nation 
can provide, including access to top quality mental health programs.

H.R. 327 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to take a 
comprehensive approach to combating the negative long-term effects of 
PTSD.

Specifically, this Act requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to 
develop a program that includes screening for suicide risk factors for 
veterans receiving medical care at all Department facilities, referral 
services for at-risk veterans for counseling and treatment, designation 
of a suicide prevention counselor at each Department facility, a 24-
hour veterans' mental health care availability, peer support 
counseling, and mental health counseling program for veterans who have 
experienced sexual trauma while in military service.

I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure to improve 
suicide-prevention programs through the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
I commend the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for their 
hard work on this bill.
