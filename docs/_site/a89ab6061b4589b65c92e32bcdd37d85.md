Ms. HOOLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today with the solemn duty of 
memorializing the passing of an American Hero.

Corporal Kory D. Wiens and his canine partner Cooper were killed 
while on patrol in Muhammad Sath, Iraq.

Some of us remember the news reports about Kory and his companion; it 
was a heartwarming story of a special bond between a young man and very 
special retriever. Once introduced to each other at Lackland, they were 
never far apart.

Even in death, Kory and Cooper remain a team. Together they gave 
their last full measure of devotion performing their duty--together 
they earned the peace of knowing they lived a good, meaningful life.

Today, Kory lives on in our memories.

Sadly he is not the first--and will not be the last--to fall in this 
war.

However, we cannot allow the mounting enormity of loss diminish the 
sacrifice--the life and loss--of Kory or those that follow.

Colleagues, I ask you to put down pen and paper; pause for a moment 
and reflect upon our circumstance.

Take this moment: honor the service of Kory Wiens--mourn his 
passing--and accept the gift of life and liberty he freely gave.

Kory Wiens was born and raised in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.

He was a cub scout, a wrestler, and a quarterback at West Albany High 
School. Kory was an all-American: a young man that believed our Nation 
was worthy of its promise; a patriot that lived a life of standing up 
for those that could not stand on their own.

Kory and his brother Kevin, who is still serving in Iraq, exemplified 
the kind of courage that made our Nation, State, and community the home 
of the brave, and land of the free.

Today, we know that Corporal Wiens' law enforcement career will not 
extend beyond his service in the Army.

We know that the ''Brotherhood of Wiens'' is now one member smaller, 
but that Kory, Kevin, and Kyle will never again fully celebrate their 
special bond.

And we know that we as a people--that we as a Nation--will never be 
what it could have been without him.

Kory wanted to serve his community. His life can serve as a lesson 
for us all, if we choose to embrace its meaning and we choose to honor 
his legacy.

What if we all took our responsibilities as seriously?

What if we worked at being selfless more, selfish less?

What if we helped each other realize the promise of our ideals and 
cooperated with each other to make America the kind of place worthy of 
young men like Kory Wiens?

We have that choice.

Together we can use the life and legacy of Kory Wiens to rekindle the 
spirit of our America.

Together we can keep the spirit of Kory Wiens--and all those like 
him--alive through a daily commitment to make this place better than we 
find it.

And together we can work for a time when peace replaces war, when 
service and sacrifice are celebrated without loss.

Let us commit ourselves anew to earning the gifts given.
