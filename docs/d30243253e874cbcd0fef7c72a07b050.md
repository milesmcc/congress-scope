# UNITES STATES POLICY IN IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2007--S. J. RES. 9
## `d30243253e874cbcd0fef7c72a07b050`
`Mr. LEVIN â€” 15 March 2007`

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in November, the American people sent a 
clear message to Washington. They said: Change the course in Iraq. A 
few weeks later, the Iraq Study Group issued its bipartisan report 
calling for a change of course in Iraq. Even the President's new 
Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, during his confirmation hearing, 
acknowledged that the current course in Iraq was not working. But 
instead of developing a new strategy, the President has stayed on his 
failed course, plunging American troops deeper and deeper into a civil 
war on the streets of Baghdad and relying on the promises of Iraqi 
politicians who have not delivered on previous promises.

The question for us today is whether we will accept that failing 
strategy or whether we will change it. The President's deepening 
military involvement will not lead to a stable Iraq because it has a 
fundamental flaw. It tries to impose a military solution on a political 
crisis.

Listen to the assessment of Iraq Prime Minister Maliki of the 
situation in his country. This is what he said:




 The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the 


 cycle of bloodletting of innocents are the Iraqi politicians.


Outside the White House is a consensus that a political solution 
among the Iraqis is required, but President Bush persists on a military 
deepening involvement.

The President claims that Iraqis will meet the political benchmarks 
that they have put forward, but the track record of Iraqi politicians 
indicates otherwise. On issue after issue, the Iraqi politicians have 
failed to keep their word, and Iraq is worse off because of those 
failures.

The President's course of action--deeper and deeper military 
involvement--sends a signal that the Iraqi leaders can continue to 
bicker without consequence. If the Iraqis fail to meet their own 
benchmarks, the President will presumably continue to bail them out by 
sending American troops to police an Iraqi civil war. Unless failure to 
meet benchmarks has consequences, those benchmarks have little meaning. 
We must change the course if there is going to be any hope of success 
in Iraq.

The best leverage we have is the presence and mission of American 
forces. As long as our presence is open-ended, the dynamic in Iraq will 
remain the same: Insurgents will target our troops, militias will cause 
mayhem, and the Iraqi politicians will sit in relative safety in the 
Green Zone, unwilling to make the compromises so essential to reaching 
a political settlement that can save their country. But if we send a 
clear message that we are ending the open-ended commitment, that will 
shift responsibility to the Iraqis, both politically and militarily, 
for their own future.

By requiring the President to change the mission of American forces 
to the three missions specified in the Reid resolution, by beginning a 
phased redeployment of American forces in 4 months, the resolution 
before us would force the Iraqi leaders to face reality and to 
understand that their future as a nation is in their own hands, not 
ours. The Iraqis will finally be forced to decide if they want a civil 
war or they want a nation. They will then understand we cannot save 
them from themselves.


The President and his supporters ask for patience. But asking for 
patience now, after all these years of asking for patience without 
success, is a little like Lucy asking Charlie Brown to try to kick the 
football one more time. We ought to be wise enough by now to know that 
increased military involvement won't achieve the political settlement 
that is needed.

General Peter Chiarelli, Commanding General of the Multi-National 
Corps in Iraq, said the following:




 We need a commitment by all Iraqis of all the ethno-


 sectarian groups to commit first to nonviolence and to 


 resolving their differences through the political process. I 


 happen to believe that we have done everything militarily we 


 possibly can.


General Casey made a similar point in early January when he said:




 The longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main 


 burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the 


 government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about 


 reconciliation and dealing with the militias.


The real battle for Baghdad is a political battle. Maximizing success 
in Iraq requires us to change course and to shift responsibility to the 
Iraqi political leaders for the future of Iraq. To paraphrase British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair, the next chapter of Iraq's history needs to 
be written by the Iraqis.

Our vote today will decide whether we will begin changing course to 
maximize chances of success in Iraq or whether we will remain mired in 
the status quo of sending more and more American troops into the middle 
of an Iraqi civil war.
