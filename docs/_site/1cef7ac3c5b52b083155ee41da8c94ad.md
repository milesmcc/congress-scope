Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. Madam Speaker, I am honored to 
recognize a constituent of mine, Gail Belmont from Valley Springs, CA. 
Gail is an Operation Officer in the Quilts of Valor Foundation. She 
will be in Washington, DC next month.

A ''Quilt of Valor'' is a wartime quilt made to honor our War 
Wounded. It is given to all wounded service men and women to show these 
brave young men and women how much their sacrifice and service is 
appreciated. These quilts are meant to provide comfort, love and 
healing to those who have given so much. It is a tangible way to say, 
''Thank you for your sacrifice and service for our country.'' It is not 
a charity quilt nor a service quilt. It is a beautifully pieced and 
quilted wartime quilt. It is a wartime quilt made by wartime quilters. 
Over 22,000 quilts have been given to the wounded. Gail has quilted 
over 350 of those herself.

Gail is a native Californian, born in Dos Palos. After graduation 
from High School she entered the Women's Army Corp Band playing 
trumpet. She served 7 years active and reserve. She then spent 25 years 
in civil service; law enforcement; warehousing and production control 
at Sharp Depot.

Shortly after leaving Sharp Depot, Gail's parents had purchased a 
longarm quilting machine and curiosity had Gail trying her hand at 
running it. It was an instant success and led to establishing a full-
time business, at first in the family garage. Quickly outgrowing the 
garage necessitated a move to the present location on Stabulis Road in 
Valley Springs.

Gail has won numerous awards at Machine Quilters Showcase and all the 
local Fairs and Quilt Shows. Her work is well known in this community 
in all charity affairs. Quilts have come to her from all over the 
nation for her special expertise which is free hand quilting and then 
have been sent all over the world.

When Gail left Valley Springs for camp Lejeune NC, she and others had 
200 Quilts of Valor with them. They stopped at different towns across 
the country picking up quilts and delivered them to Camp Lejeune, North 
Carolina where they awarded 1,354 quilts to the 3rd Battalion, 8th 
Marines who just returned from Afghanistan. While in DC, Gail will join 
Catherine Roberts who founded this organization as they award the 
Women's Veterans Memorial at Arlington a quilt and will be honored at 
the Commandant's evening Parade at the Marine Corps Barracks.

On a previous trip to Washington, Gail awarded the Pentagon a quilt 
she had quilted which is called the ''Pentagon Pride Eagle of Valor 
Quilt of Valor''. This quilt is on display at the Pentagon in the 9/11 
display case.
