`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 14 July 2010`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I won't take the full 8 minutes, but I 
again want to point out a couple of facts to my colleagues here. We are 
faced with a very difficult economy, and this is an economy that 
President Obama inherited. He is trying to dig this economy out of the 
ditch that my friends on the other side of the aisle dug us into. It is 
not easy, and it's not going to happen overnight.

But it is a fact that Barack Obama has created more jobs in 1 year 
than George Bush created in 8 years. We were losing hundreds of 
thousands of jobs on average each month when President Bush was in 
office. We are now gaining jobs; not as many as we would like, not as 
fast as we would like, but we are moving in a very different direction. 
We're moving in the direction where we are creating more jobs, and 
we're moving toward a healthier economy. That is just the fact.

And the question is, Do we try to work with this administration to 
get this economy back on a strong footing, or are we going to try to 
obstruct everything and root for failure?

I mean, my friends on the other side of the aisle, their whole kind 
of, their whole platform is based on this President failing, on this 
economy failing. How cynical can you get?

The fact is, we have a lot of work to do, and we need to focus on 
jobs. Jobs is the issue. We need to extend unemployment benefits to 
those who have lost their jobs, mostly through no fault of their own.



We need to help them get through this difficult time. I regret that 
my Republican friends in the Senate continue to obstruct the extension 
of unemployment benefits. I hope nobody goes home for an August recess 
until unemployment benefits are extended.

My friends say we can't afford to pay for it. Can't afford to pay to 
help people in our own country. Yet last week $33 billion in borrowed 
money for nation building that supports a corrupt government in 
Afghanistan. They all support it. No questions asked. All borrowed 
money. And I get it. You know, if you think it's important, fine. But 
if nation building in Afghanistan is important, a little bit more 
nation building here in the United States of America is important.

We have to take care of our people here who are experiencing very 
difficult times because of the troubled economy. We just can't sit here 
and bicker and bicker and bicker and let people lose their homes and 
let people not be able to pay their bills or put food on their table.

The fact of the matter is, Madam Speaker, this President has 
accomplished a great deal in a very short time. And my expectation is 
that if we continue to follow his economic agenda, that we will see 
this economy get on stronger footing. The bill that's before us, the 
telework bill, I think is a good bill. It will save the taxpayers lots 
of money. IBM, a private-sector company, says it saved them tens of 
millions of dollars each year. If it can save IBM tens of millions of 
dollars each year, it ought to save the Federal Government hundreds of 
millions. Let us take that money, put it toward deficit reduction or 
put it toward helping our people who are in deep trouble as this 
economy tries to recover.

Madam Speaker, I would close by urging my colleagues to support the 
rule. I would urge a ''yes'' vote on the previous question on the rule.
