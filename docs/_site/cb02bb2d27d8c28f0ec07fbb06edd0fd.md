`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 27 July 2010`

Mr. KUCINICH. I yield myself 5 minutes.

In response to the gentlelady's comments about training troops, the 
U.S. has been training troops in Iraq and Afghanistan for over 7 years 
now with arguably little or no sign of success; yet we are applying the 
same failed counterinsurgency strategies in Iraq, Afghanistan and now 
perhaps Pakistan.



A seemingly endless stream of money, an estimated $1 trillion, has 
been poured into the destruction of Iraq and Afghanistan. Millions of 
dollars in taxpayer money spent to prop up a corrupt and unpopular 
central government and to train local security forces. Yet attacks on 
the U.S. and allied troops continue to rise. Documents released by 
WikiLeaks report that Pakistan intelligence service, the ISI, supports 
Taliban attacks on U.S. forces. This despite an average of $1 billion a 
year in aid from the U.S.

Now, this raises a broader question, Mr. Speaker, which is really 
about today in Washington. Can the United States win the war in 
Afghanistan or hope to have any success there at all if our major ally, 
Pakistan, through their intelligence agency, is cooperating with the 
Taliban against our troops in Afghanistan?

Listen to this. Even Afghanistan Government officials are complaining 
about this.

I refer to an article from Reuters I would like to place in the 
Record. The title of the article, ''Afghanistan questions U.S. silence 
over Pakistan's role,'' where they are complaining that Pakistan's role 
in the insurgency is being ignored. And an official of the Afghanistan 
Security Council, according to Reuters, quote, ''warned that the war 
would not succeed unless there was a review of Afghan policy by 
Washington that focuses on Taliban sanctuaries and bases in Pakistan 
and their supporters.'' Now, when you have things so bad that even in 
Afghanistan, where the government is hopelessly corrupt, they're 
complaining about Pakistan, you see the kind of mess we could get into 
if we expand the footprint of our troops within the border of Pakistan.

Afghanistan Questions U.S. Silence Over Pakistan's Role













 (By Sayed Salahuddin)




 Kabul (Reuters)--The United States has pursued a 


 contradictory policy with regard to the Afghan war by 


 ignoring Pakistan's role in the insurgency, the Afghan 


 government said on Tuesday, following the leak of U.S. 


 military documents.



 The classified documents released by the organization, 


 WikiLeaks, show current and former members of Pakistan's spy 


 agency were actively collaborating with the Taliban in 


 plotting attacks in Afghanistan.



 On Tuesday, in its first reaction to the leak, 


 Afghanistan's National Security Council said the United 


 States had failed to attack the patrons and supporters of the 


 Taliban hiding in Pakistan throughout the nine-year conflict.



 ''With regret . . . our allies did not show necessary 


 attention about the external support for the international 


 terrorists . . . for the regional stability and global 


 security,'' the council said in a statement.



 Afghanistan has long blamed Pakistan for meddling in its 


 affairs, accusing the neighbor of plotting attacks to 


 destabilize it. Islamabad, which has had longstanding ties to 


 the Taliban, denies involvement in the insurgency and says it 


 is a victim of militancy itself.



 The National Security Council did not name Pakistan, but 


 said use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy was a 


 dangerous gamble and had to be stopped.



 ''Having a contradictory and vague policy against the 


 forces who use terrorism as a tool for interference and 


 sabotage against others, have had devastating results,'' it 


 said.



 At a news conference later on Tuesday, council head Rangeen 


 Dadfar Spanta was more specific, questioning the billions of 


 dollars in cash aid and milita assistance Washington has 


 given to Pakistan over the years.



 ''It is really not justifiable for the Afghan people that 


 how come you give to one country $11 billion or more as help 


 for reconstruction or strengthen its security or defensive 


 forces, but from other side the very forces train 


 terrorism,'' he said.



 He warned that the war would not succeed unless there was a 


 review of Afghan policy by Washington that focuses on Taliban 


 sanctuaries and bases in Pakistan and their supporters.



 Those supporting militants should be punished rather than 


 be treated as an ally, said Spanta, who served for years as 


 foreign minister in President Hamid Karzai's government until 


 last year.



 The White House has condemned the WikiLeaks disclosures, 


 saying it could threaten national security. Pakistan said 


 leaking unprocessed reports from the battlefield was 


 irresponsible.



 The documents numbering tens of thousands also said that 


 coalition troops had killed hundreds of Afghan civilians in 


 unreported incidents and often sought to cover up the 


 mistakes that have shaken up confidence in the war effort 


 among many in Afghanistan.



 On Monday, the Afghan government said it had spoken in 


 private and in public meetings with its Western allies about 


 the need to stop civilian deaths.



 ''In the past nine years (since Taliban's fall) thousands 


 of citizens of Afghanistan and from our ally countries have 


 become victimised,'' it said.


It's been said early on in this debate that the WikiLeaks documents, 
92,000 documents, I don't know who has had the time to read them all, 
but according to what's been said publicly, that it represents nothing 
new. Here's the key findings of these WikiLeaks documents that were 
reported in the New York Times in the last day: a point that our troops 
have been placed in mortal danger because of poor logistics; that 
countless innocent civilians have been killed by mistake; that the 
Afghan government is hopelessly corrupt; that Pakistan intelligence has 
collaborated with the Taliban against the U.S.; that the Pentagon has 
understated the firepower of the insurgents; and that a top Pakistani 
general was visiting a suicide bombing school on a monthly basis.

Now, if this has been going on for years and it's nothing new, you 
have to ask the question then why in the world weren't we having that 
debate over the last 6 years? If this is nothing new, why didn't the 
American people know all about this? Why did it take a document dump by 
WikiLeaks to suddenly wake up the Congress to say, Hey, wait a minute, 
the war isn't going the way you thought it was?

I mean it's not only a question of if we knew then what we know now, 
it's a question that do we remember what we knew then? And why isn't it 
affecting our policy right now? Why aren't we getting out of 
Afghanistan? Why are we pretending there is a withdrawal from Iraq if 
we leave 50,000 troops there? And why in the world would we be in this 
environment expanding our footprint in Pakistan?

I reserve the balance of my time.
