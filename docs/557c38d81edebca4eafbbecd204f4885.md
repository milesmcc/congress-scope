Mr. WICKER. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, this is an 
economic security issue. But it is also a national security issue.

Last week, the LA Times reported that the Pentagon will spend $16.4 
billion on fuel this year--$16.4 billion as compared to $5.2 billion in 
2003. The cost of fuel for our national security has gone up that much. 
This is a major concern for our military. They are having to budget for 
ongoing missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and all of the areas around 
the world in which we are engaged.

That same article in the LA Times mentioned another important point 
about the need to adopt alternative fuel sources, now more than ever. 
The Air Force, a branch where I served for some 4 years, and longer 
than that in the Reserve--the Air Force is already researching the use 
of coal to liquid for its fighter jets.

Their goal is to have half of the planes burning coal-based fuel by 
the year 2016, a substance which we have an abundance of in the United 
States of America.

At these record prices, commercial carriers are beginning to follow 
suit. The Federal Government should encourage and incentivize the 
ventures, doing research on coal-to-liquids.

Congress has an opportunity to be proactive. We could choose to boost 
our economy by producing more energy domestically, and I am proud to 
join my Republican colleagues in a clear message which I think also 
states an obvious truth: We need to find more resources and we need to 
use less.

That is the reason I have readily cosponsored the Gas Price Reduction 
Act. We offered it only a few weeks ago, and it gets to the very heart 
of our debate--increasing supply to keep up with increasing demand as 
well as using less through conservation and alternative fuel methods 
here in the United States.

Both Senator Cochran and I are cosponsors of this legislation. It is 
my hope that we can work together across partisan aisles to come up 
with a solution for America. We do not need political games. We do not 
need to have a limited structural legislative vehicle that allows our 
side only one vote on one proposal which probably cannot pass in its 
current form and allows one vote on the Democratic side for a 
legislative proposal that will also probably not ever see its way to 
the statute book. We need to do something about this problem. And this 
year, these few remaining days of this legislative session comprise the 
time to act.
