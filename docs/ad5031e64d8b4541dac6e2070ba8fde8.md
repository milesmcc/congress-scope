Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Friday's The Post and 
Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, detailed the dire consequences 
of setting artificial timelines for withdrawal from Iraq. The editorial 
states that it would be tragic if the rug should be pulled from under 
U.S. forces by the U.S. Congress.

The political message coming from House Democrats threatens to throw 
efforts to stabilize Iraq off balance. As The Post and Courier, where I 
was a former reporter, concludes, General Petraeus should be given the 
time and forces he needs to succeed, and not a legislative recipe for 
failure. Democrats and Republicans should be united to remember that al 
Qaeda spokesman for Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri, has clearly identified 
that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central fronts in the global war on 
terrorism. Bin Laden has specifically stated, ''The most serious issue 
today for the whole world is this Third World War that is raging in 
Iraq.''

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
