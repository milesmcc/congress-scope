Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I think the issue of providing health 
coverage to 10 million children is important enough to give our 
constituents adequate time to weigh in on it.

Let them consider whether they want to spend $7 billion a year to 
provide health care to 10 million uninsured children, an amount 
equivalent to 2/1/2/ weeks spent on the Iraq war.

Insure our children for $7 billion a year? President Bush runs for 
the veto pen. $10 billion a month for Iraq? The President asks for $190 
billion more.

I urge my colleagues to take this time to listen to their 
constituents. Look into the eyes of an uninsured child. That child 
could be sitting next to yours or your grandchild in school.

And remember, unlike the war funding which is all on credit cards, 
this bill is actually paid for. This is an offer, as someone running 
for reelection, you can't afford to refuse.
