Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to 
Corporal Phillip J. Brodnick, a courageous young soldier who died in 
Iraq on August 22, 2007. As we mourn his loss, we use this time to 
honor his life and express our gratitude for his dedicated service.

Phillip Brodnick was born in Mokena, Illinois, and lived in Burbank 
until he was 8. He then moved to Frankfurt, Illinois and graduated in 
2000 from Lincoln-Way High School. After graduation, Brodnick's desire 
to serve his country led him to enlist in the Army, and he soon served 
a 2-year tour of duty in Kosovo before being discharged in 2002.

However, the country's need and Brodnick's desire to serve led him to 
re-enlist in the Army in 2005.

In August of 2006, Brodnick was deployed to Iraq as part of the 2nd 
Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division based out of 
Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. His excellent service, leadership and 
ability were soon recognized, leading to a recent promotion to the rank 
of corporal.

Although initially scheduled to return home in June, Corporal 
Brodnick dutifully accepted a 4-month tour extension in Iraq. 
Tragically, on August 22, Corporal Brodnick and 13 other soldiers were 
killed when the Black Hawk helicopter they were on crashed. He was only 
25 years old.

Aside from his military service to our Nation, Corporal Brodnick is 
remembered as patriotic and as a great friend and also as an animal 
lover who always looked out for his family. He aspired to one day 
follow in his father's footsteps and become a police officer.

While attending his wake last week, I was moved by the large number 
of lives that Corporal Brodnick had touched in his 25 short years. 
Today I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning the loss of Corporal 
Phillip J. Brodnick. We will never forget his sacrifice and are forever 
indebted to him, as well as all of our soldiers who have died for 
making the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Our thoughts, prayers 
and deepest sympathies are with Corporal Brodnick's family and friends 
in this difficult time.
