Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women 
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2055 in Centralia, Illinois, as 
they celebrate their 75th anniversary on December 18.

Post 2055 began in a renovated church in 1934 and was followed a year 
later by the chartering of the local VFW Ladies Auxiliary. The post has 
grown from its original membership of 56 to a high of more than 600 
members.

The men and women of the Centralia VFW post have continued to serve 
their community and our nation long after their terms of active duty 
military service have ended. Post 2055 members assemble and send care 
packages to service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Members of VFW Post 2055 are dedicated to serving their community. 
They regularly volunteer at the local Veterans Administration hospital, 
teach firearms safety courses and participate in cancer research 
fundraisers.

I would like to thank the men and women of VFW Post 2055 in 
Centralia, Illinois, for their service to our nation, their continued 
support of America's soldiers and their dedication to their community.
