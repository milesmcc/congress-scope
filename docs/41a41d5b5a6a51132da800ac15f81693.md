Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, this weekend, we received sad and 
disturbing news from Afghanistan as 10 humanitarian aid workers, six of 
them Americans, were killed in a barbaric Taliban attack.

Among those killed was one of my constituents, Glen Lapp of 
Lancaster, as well as Brian Carderelli, whose family I have worked with 
on humanitarian aid projects. The team leader, Tom Little, served with 
his wife and daughters in Afghanistan for over 30 years. They were 
ambushed while traveling from an isolated village where they provided 
eye care and other medical assistance. The group they were working 
with, International Assistance Mission, has been working in Afghanistan 
for decades, reaching out to heal the sick and restore sight.

Because of the barbaric actions of the Taliban and these senseless 
killings, the people of Afghanistan will lose the valuable assistance 
of individuals with special medical skills to help those living far 
away from modern medical services.

I know that Glen, Brian, Tom and all of the volunteers will be dearly 
missed and we honor them for their courage and love for the Afghan 
people and their service to them.
