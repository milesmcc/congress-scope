Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, in June of 2006, the Bush administration 
announced a new plan for securing Baghdad by increasing the presence of 
Iraq security forces. That plan failed.

In July, additional U.S. troops are moved in. By October, the 
Pentagon was admitting that the plan to secure Baghdad had failed. In 
the fall of 2005, the Bush administration increased troop levels by 
22,000 around the time of the elections, and the escalation had little 
long-term impact on quelling sectarian violence.

The New York Times had a story by a young troop member in Baghdad 
yesterday. You need to read it, because it talked about how the snipers 
killed one of their buddies and how they went in to get his body out 
and to get his helmet, and the blood spilled down the clothing of the 
rescuers.

This is happening every day because we are fighting a war with an 
unknown enemy in the middle of sectarian violence. It must stop.
