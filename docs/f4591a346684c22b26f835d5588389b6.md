`Mr. LEAHY â€” 6 August 2009`

---


Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his 
kind comments. As he knows, I made similar comments about him this 
morning in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I reiterate them here today.

We did decide, both Senator Sessions and I, at the beginning of this 
process that we would try to make sure everybody was heard. We may have 
different outcomes on how everybody would vote, but everybody was 
heard. That has been done. I compliment the leaders of the Senate for 
doing that.

We are about to conclude Senate consideration of this nominee. I 
thank those Senators who evaluated this nomination fairly. I thank 
especially those Republican Senators who have shown the independence to 
join the bipartisan confirmation of this historic nomination. I thank 
all Senators on both sides of the aisle who spent hours and hours and 
days and days in our hearings.

Some critics have attacked President Obama's nomination of Judge 
Sonia Sotomayor by contending he picked her for the Supreme Court to 
substitute empathy for the rule of law. These critics are wrong about 
the President; they are wrong about Sonia Sotomayor.

Let's leave out the rhetoric and go to the facts. When the President 
announced his choice of Judge Sotomayor 10 weeks ago, he focused on the 
qualities he sought in a nominee. He started with ''rigorous 
intellect'' and ''a mastery of the law.''

He then referred to recognition of the limits of the judicial role 
when he talked about ''an understanding that a judge's job is to 
interpret, not make, law; to approach decisions without any particular 
ideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice; a 
respect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law 
to the facts at hand.'' That is what President Obama said.

Then he went on to mention experience. He said:




 Experience being tested by obstacles and barriers, by 


 hardship and misfortune; experience insisting, persisting, 


 and ultimately overcoming those barriers. It is experience 


 that can give a person a common touch and a sense of 


 compassion; an understanding of how the world works and how 


 ordinary people live. And that is why it is a necessary 


 ingredient in the kind of justice we need on the Supreme 


 Court.


Then the President concluded by discussing how Judge Sotomayor has 
all these qualities. The President was looking not just for lawyerly 
ability, but for wisdom--for an understanding of how the law and 
justice work in the everyday lives of Americans.

In a subsequent radio and Internet address, the President reiterated 
the point when he said:




 As a Justice of the Supreme Court, she will bring not only 


 the experience acquired over the course of a brilliant legal 


 career, but the wisdom accumulated over the course of an 


 extraordinary journey--a journey defined by hard work, fierce 


 intelligence, and the enduring faith that, in America, all 


 things are possible.


President Obama did not say that he viewed compassion or sympathy as 
a substitute for the rule of law. In fact, he has never said he would 
substitute empathy for the rule of law. That is a false choice. The 
opposition to this nomination is based on a false premise.

When she was first named, Judge Sotomayor said: ''I firmly believe in 
the rule of law as a foundation for all our basic rights.'' Judge 
Sotomayor reiterated time and time again during her confirmation 
hearing her fidelity to the rule of law. She said:




 Judges can't rely on what's in their heart. They don't 


 determine the law. Congress makes the laws. The job of the 


 judge is to apply the law. And so it's not the heart that 


 compels conclusions in cases. It's the law. The judge applies 


 the law to the facts before that judge.


Those who, after 4 days of hearing, would ignore her testimony, 
should at least take heed of her record as a judge. Judge Sotomayor has 
demonstrated her fairness and impartiality during her 17 years as a 
judge. She has followed the law. There is no record of her substituting 
her personal views for the law. The many independent studies that have 
closely examined Judge Sotomayor's record have concluded it is a record 
of applying the law, not bias.

What she has said, and what we should all acknowledge, is the value 
her background brings to her as a judge and would bring to her as a 
Justice, our first Latina Justice.

Judge Sotomayor is certainly not the first nominee to discuss how her 
background has shaped her character. Justice O'Connor has acknowledged, 
''We are all creatures of our upbringing. We bring whatever we are as 
people to a job like the Supreme Court.'' Everybody knows that, just as 
all 100 of us bring who we are to the Senate. Many recent Justices have 
spoken of their life experiences as influential factors in how they 
approach the bench. Justice Alito and Justice Thomas, nominated by 
Republican Presidents, did so famously at their confirmation hearings, 
and then they were praised by the Republican side of the aisle for 
doing so. Indeed, when the first President Bush nominated Justice 
Thomas to the Supreme Court, he touted him as an ''intelligent person 
who has great empathy.''

Some of those choosing to oppose this historic nomination have tried 
to justify their opposition by falsely contending that President Obama 
is pitting empathy against the rule of law. Not so. Not so. This 
President and this nominee are committed to the rule of law. They 
recognize the role of life experience not as a substitute for the law 
or in conflict with its mandates, but as informing judgment.

What is really at play is not a new Obama ''empathy standard'' with 
respect to judicial selection, but a double standard being applied by 
those who supported the nominations of Justice Alito and Justice 
Thomas.

Judge Sotomayor's career and judicial record demonstrate that she has 
always followed the rule of law. The point is, we don't have to guess 
at what kind of a judge she has been. She has had more experience on 
the Federal court, both trial level and appellate level, than any 
nominee in decades. She will be the only member of the U.S. Supreme 
Court with experience as a trial judge. We don't have to guess. There 
are well over 3,000 cases, so we don't have to guess. Attempts at 
distorting that record by suggesting that her ethnicity or her heritage 
would be the driving force in her decisions as a Justice of the Supreme 
Court are demeaning to women and all communities of color.

I have spoken over the last several years about urging Presidents 
from both political parties to nominate someone from outside the 
''judicial monastery.'' I believe that experience, perspective, an 
understanding of how the world works and people live, and the effect 
decisions will have on the lives of people are very important 
qualifications. By striving for a more diverse bench drawn from judges 
with a wider set of backgrounds and experiences we can better ensure 
there will be no prejudices and biases controlling our courts of 
justice. All nominees have talked about the value they will draw on the 
bench from their backgrounds. That diversity of experience and strength 
is not a weakness in achieving an impartial judiciary.

I have voted on every member of the current U.S. Supreme Court. I 
have participated in the hearings of all but one of them, and that one 
I voted on the nomination having watched the hearing. I have sat in on 
the hearings of Justices no longer there, either because of retirement 
or death. I have conducted hundreds of nomination hearings--everything 
from courts of appeals judges, Federal district court judges, and 
Department of Justice appointees. I have been ranking member on two 
Supreme Court nominations and conducted this one. I mention that to 
thank the Senator from Alabama for his cooperation during it.

After those hundreds of hearings, you get a sense of the person you 
are listening to. I met for hours with Judge Sotomayor, either in the 
hearing room or privately. You learn who a person is, you really do, in 
asking these kinds of questions. You have to bring your own experience 
and your own knowledge to


what you are hearing. There are only 101 people in this great Nation of 
300 million people who get a say as to who is going to be one of the 
nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court. First and foremost, it is the 
President who makes the nomination, but then the 100 of us in the U.S. 
Senate who must follow our own conscience, our own experience, our own 
abilities in deciding whether we will advise and consent to that 
nomination. It is an awesome responsibility, and we should do it not 
because we are swayed by any special interest group of either the right 
or the left.

In fact, I have a rule--my office knows it very well--that in Supreme 
Court confirmations I will not meet with groups on either the right or 
the left about it. I will make up my mind through those hours and days 
and the transcripts of the hearing. I would urge all Senators to do 
that. I think it is unfortunate if any Senator of either party were to 
make up their mind on a Supreme Court nominee based on pressure from 
special interest groups from either the right or the left. That is a 
disfavor to those hundreds of millions of Americans who don't belong to 
pressure groups of either the right or the left. They expect us to 
stand up.

That is what we should do on Judge Sotomayor. This is an 
extraordinary nominee. I remember when President Obama called me a few 
hours before he nominated her. I was with our troops in Afghanistan, 
and he explained what he was going to do in a few hours. We talked 
about that and we talked about Afghanistan, but we talked especially 
about her. He said, you know, there are Web sites already developing 
opposed to her. And within hours, we had leaders calling her racist, 
bigoted, or being affiliated with a group akin to the Ku Klux Klan. 
Fortunately, Senators on neither side joined with that.

We are almost at a time for a vote. I would hope every Senator would 
search his or her conscience and ask whether they are voting for this 
nominee based on their oath of office, based on their conscience, or 
are they reflecting a special interest group.

When the Judiciary Committee began the confirmation hearings on this 
Supreme Court nomination, and when the Senate this week began its 
debate, I recounted an insight from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which 
is often quoted by President Obama. ''Let us realize the arc of the 
moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''

It is distinctly American to continually refine our Union, moving us 
closer to our ideals. Our union is not yet perfected, but with this 
confirmation, we will be making progress.

Years from now, we will remember this time when we crossed paths with 
the quintessentially American journey of Sonia Sotomayor and when our 
Nation took another step forward through this historic confirmation 
process. I urge each Senator to honor our oath, our Constitution, and 
our national promise by voting his or her conscience on the nomination 
of Sonia Sotomayor to serve as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I 
will proudly vote for her.

Mr. President, I see the Republican leader is here, and I will 
reserve the remainder of my time.
