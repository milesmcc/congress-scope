Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I think we all share that view, 
but the amendment, if it is anything, it is not precipitous. This is 
coming after a great deal of debate. We have had a vote on this. The 
Senate voted to do something very similar to this, and it was vetoed.

We have a 120-day period to begin to reduce forces. That is not 
precipitous. That gives the Iraqis notice, now 4 months more notice 
after enactment, which can't come for many months, that they have to 
begin to get their political act together.
