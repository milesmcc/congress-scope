Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, for weeks the House has 
debated our strategy in Iraq and continued funding for the war. In the 
midst of this debate, the Democratic leadership adjourned for a 2-week 
spring break.

Even today, we appear no closer to a solution that will support our 
mission and our troops and sustain an effective foreign policy. The 
Democrat leadership of both Chambers has indicated its desire to move 
their message of defeat. Fortunately, President Bush is standing by his 
commitment to veto the bill and promote our mission for victory in 
Iraq, to protect American families.

Al Qaeda has stated Iraq is the central front in the war on 
terrorism. Osama bin Laden has characterized Iraq as the ''third world 
war.'' Withdrawing from Iraq will not end the global war on terrorism.

I have confidence in our military leaders, who should not be 
micromanaged by Congress. Yesterday, Admiral William Fallon testified 
effectively that the new reinforcement course in Baghdad is producing 
positive results. We will face the terrorists overseas or again in the 
streets of America.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
