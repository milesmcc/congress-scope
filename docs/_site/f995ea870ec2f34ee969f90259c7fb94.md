Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted against the Cornyn amendment 
because it significantly misrepresents the NIE because it makes 
assumptions about what may happen in Iraq that are speculative, and 
because it represents the same failed mindset that has resulted in the 
current disaster in Iraq. While the dangers of Iraq becoming a failed 
state are real, this amendment seeks to justify the current massive and 
indefinite U.S. military presence in that country, which is an 
unacceptable distraction and diversion of resources from the fight 
against al-Qaida and its affiliates worldwide.
