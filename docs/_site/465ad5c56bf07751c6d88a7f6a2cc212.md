Mr. ROSS. I thank my colleague and former policy cochair for the Blue 
Dogs from Tennessee, Mr. Cooper, for his insight on not only Iraq war 
spending but these other fiscal responsibilities, trying to restore 
fiscal responsibility to our government and those issues surrounding 
that.

You mentioned Medicare. Medicare is health insurance for, basically, 
it's the only form of health insurance most seniors have to either stay 
healthy or get well, not to be confused with Medicaid, which is health 
insurance for the poor, the disabled, and the elderly.


Your bill, as you discuss the entitlement programs and find ways to 
put an end to these deficits, I applaud you for trying to do this in a 
bipartisan manner and having support on both sides of the aisle.

Do you have any other examples you'd like to share with us on this 
legislation?
