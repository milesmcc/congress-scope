Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my friend from New Hampshire 
for his observations about not only the process but the merits of his 
proposal.

Let me conclude by reiterating once again that I think the Senator 
from New Hampshire and I and others, including those who have been 
speaking on the Senate floor on this side this morning, welcome the 
debate about Iraq policy. We had anticipated having the debate this 
week. It is not too late to have the debate this week.

We are now down to two proposals, just two proposals. It took a lot 
of time on our side to get down to one for us and, of course, the 
majority has a preference of its own. This debate could be wrapped up 
in relatively short order, and then we could move on with the 
continuing resolution, where I hope it might be possible for the 
minority to have at least some amendments.

Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.
