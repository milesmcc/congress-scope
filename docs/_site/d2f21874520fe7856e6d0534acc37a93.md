Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Sarasota South 
Elks Lodge # 2495, which will be recognized at the Florida Elks' State 
Convention this month for their efforts to improve the quality of life 
of Sarasota area veterans.

The Elks is one of the leading charitable and service orders in the 
United States. Since 1917, they have pledged to never forget our 
nation's veterans.

For the past three years, the men and women of the Sarasota South 
Elks Lodge have put these words to action by giving generously of their 
energy and resources to improve the lives of ill, aging, and homeless 
veterans.

In the last three years, the Sarasota South Elks Lodge has donated 
$41,590 in money, clothing and personal items, given 1,390 in voluntary 
man hours and driven over 4,100 miles in an effort to make a difference 
in the lives of our veterans.

They have provided food, clothing, and employment opportunities to 
homeless veterans, made monthly visits with veterans hospitalized at 
Bay Pines, and provided transportation and companionship to more than 
10 veterans who are shut-ins without family in the area. They have 
adopted the families of two soldiers on active duty in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. They have been directly involved with 21 military funerals 
and five flag-raising ceremonies. Finally, they have sponsored annual 
barbeques during which they have fed and entertained hundreds of 
veterans.

On behalf of the people of Florida's 13th District, I thank the 
members of the Sarasota South Elks for their compassionate service to 
our veterans. I am honored to represent this caring and hardworking 
organization.
