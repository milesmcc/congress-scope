Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Navy Commander 
David Asjes of Ames, Iowa as a recipient of a Bronze Star


Medal for his heroic achievements during combat operations in support 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Bronze Star, the Department of 
Defense's fourth highest award given, is awarded to individuals for 
bravery, heroism, and meritorious service.

Commander Asjes earned the Bronze Star as a military personnel 
assigned individually for his expertise in coordinating air combat 
operations, organizing ground units and executing tactical air 
operations. Commander Asjes served in Iraq from October 13, 2007 to 
April 2, 2008. He has honorably served in the U.S. Navy for 23 years.

Commander Asjes' sacrifices, heroism and hard work illustrate the 
compassion and professionalism of America's troops. I commend Navy 
Commander David Asjes' courageousness and service to our great nation 
and consider it an honor to represent Commander Asjes and his family in 
the United States Congress. I know my colleagues join me in wishing him 
the best in his future service to our country.
