Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Chairman, I just want to thank 
Congresswoman Johnson and Congressman Young for offering this wonderful 
amendment. This will mean that the 2,100 children of parents who died 
in Iraq or Afghanistan will be able to get the full Pell Grant, which 
is about $4,800 this year and will be upped to $5,400 by 2012. It is 
certainly the least we can do.

There are many more things we want to do beyond this to help these 
children whose parents paid the ultimate sacrifice. But I think it is 
wonderful that these two Congressmen have come forward with this very 
commonsense and important amendment. I enthusiastically support it and 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it as well.

Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
