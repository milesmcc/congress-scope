Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will make a statement prior to the Iraq 
votes, and I will be happy to lay out why we are doing this. We are 
doing this because the majority of the American people recognize this 
war in Iraq is costing huge amounts of money. Some are saying now as 
much as $15 billion a month.

But let's say it is not that much. Let's say it is only the lower 
figure of $10 billion to $12 billion a month. I met yesterday with the 
Speaker and all the 28 Democratic Governors, and they are desperate for 
money to do what their States need in dealing with health care, 
infrastructure, and fighting crime. They are desperate. Where is the 
money they need? It is going to Iraq in the sum of about $400 million a 
day.

So we are going to continue to debate this because the American 
people know what is taking place, and I will discuss this more fully 
right before the votes on the two cloture motions that have been filed 
on the Iraq situation.
