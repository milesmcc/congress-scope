Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to once again voice my support for 
the Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment to the Department of Defense 
Authorization Act. This amendment will restore habeas corpus rights to 
individuals held in U.S. custody.

Just as importantly, it will begin to undo the damage done by the 
Military Commissions Act of 2006--legislation that undermined our 
values and our commitment to the rule of law. In a struggle with 
terrorism in which our credibility, our good name, is a powerful 
weapon, the Military Commissions Act was not simply wrongheaded; it was 
dangerous. The amendment we offer today is a first step out of that 
danger and back to our moral authority.

Critics of this amendment in the Bush administration and elsewhere 
have argued that restoring habeas corpus rights will clog Federal 
courts and hamper our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This 
is simply not true.

First, in keeping with long tradition, this amendment only applies to 
individuals held on clearly defined U.S. territory, including 
Guantanamo--but not to individuals held in U.S. custody in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Several individuals filing habeas petitions from Iraq and 
Afghanistan have already been denied. The truth is that a relatively 
small number of individuals are covered by this amendment. Right now, 
fewer than 500 people are held in Guantanamo Bay. It is simply not 
credible to suggest that thousands or millions of petitions would 
deluge our courts and grind them to a halt. From 2002 to 2006, when 
detainees had the ability to file habeas petitions, the Federal courts 
continued to run smoothly. Last year, a distinguished group of retired 
judges wrote to Congress, stating clearly that habeas petitions from 
detainees in no way tied up our courts.

Second, habeas petitions heavily favor the Government's position. 
They are often decided solely by paper filings by the Government, and 
Federal judges have wide discretion in determining what type of 
evidence they need to make their determinations. In addition, usually 
only a minimal amount of evidence is needed to justify continued 
detention. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that U.S. servicemembers 
will be called from the battlefield to testify before a Federal judge.



Finally, many of those who oppose this amendment have relied on 
Justice Jackson's opinion in Johnson v. Eisenstrager to defend the 
stripping of habeas rights to detainees. But Eisentrager has been 
overtaken by more recent cases. Justice Jackson's opinion in that case 
relied in part on the fact that the petitioners were German prisoners 
of war who were imprisoned outside the United States. In 2004, however, 
the Supreme Court held in Rasul v. Bush that the U.S. courts have 
jurisdiction to hear challenges to the legality of detention of foreign 
nationals held there because the United States had complete 
jurisdiction and control over the base at Guantanamo. In other words, 
the Supreme Court itself rejected the Government's reliance on 
Eisentrager as it applies to individuals held in Guantanamo. That was 
the very decision that prompted the President and Congress to strip 
detainees of habeas rights with the Military Commissions Act.

In ignoring the most recent precedent, President Bush and his 
supporters are ignoring the history of the very bill they are now 
fighting to uphold. Their reliance on outdated rulings is, at best, 
disingenuous. Willfully or not, they have once again distorted the 
facts.

I believe that returning to the legal framework that was in place 
prior to the Military Commissions Act would not undermine our security. 
In fact, I believe reaffirming our commitment to the rule of law will 
strengthen our efforts to combat terrorism--we can protect our security 
and uphold our values at the same time. And so I ask my colleagues to 
support this amendment.
