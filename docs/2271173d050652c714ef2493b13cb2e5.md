`Mr. BUTTERFIELD â€” 6 September 2007`

---


Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, for months now we have heard from our 
Republican colleagues that September would be a critical month for the 
war in Iraq. Earlier this year when this Democratic Congress and the 
American


people voiced their overwhelming opposition to President Bush's troop 
escalation plan, our Republican colleagues said, ''Give the President 
time.''

The problem is, both the Republican Congress and the Bush 
administration have been moving the time frame for success on the troop 
escalation plan. First it was June. Then it was August. Finally, a 
couple of months ago, Republican leaders agreed that September would be 
the defining month.

It is clear that President Bush has no intention of ending the troop 
escalation in Iraq, even though the Iraqi Government has failed to meet 
the benchmarks that he himself outlined earlier this year. President 
Bush is determined to leave as many troops in Iraq as possible, no 
matter what the facts suggest.

The question now is, will Congressional Republicans finally break 
away from the President and do what is right for this Nation and for 
the military? Congressional Republicans must realize that the time has 
come to change course.
