Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, today I received a petition, an appeal 
for redress from over 1,000 active duty members of the armed services. 
Many of these honorable soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have 
served in Iraq. They did not challenge their orders, they did not 
challenge their duty to serve, they do assert their constitutional 
rights and their military code rights to speak with Members of 
Congress.

Article 3.5.7, Department of Defense directive 1325.6 provides the 
right of servicemembers to request redress and grievances against the 
actions of their commanders. The action taken and presented to me by 
individual servicemembers is an appeal for redress to end the war in 
Iraq.

Troops are risking their careers to present this message to Congress. 
They have all individually signed the following statement:

As a patriotic American proud to serve the Nation in uniform, I 
respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to support the 
prompt withdrawal of all American military forces and bases from Iraq. 
Staying in Iraq will not work and is not worth the price. It is time 
for U.S. troops to come home.
