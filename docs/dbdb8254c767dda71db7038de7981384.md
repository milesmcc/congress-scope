# PRESIDENT BUSH'S PROPOSED VETO
## `dbdb8254c767dda71db7038de7981384`
`Mr. DeFAZIO â€” 3 October 2007`

---


Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, after running up more debt than the 42 
Presidents who preceded him, $3.2 trillion borrowed and spent, $9 
trillion total debt on the backs of the American people, presiding over 
a doubling of our international debt to more than $2.2 trillion, last 
week he proposed that we should borrow and spend another $190 billion 
on the war in Iraq, nearly 600 since he launched this unnecessary war.

Subsidies to Big Oil, scandals about no-bid contracts, the President 
has rediscovered his long-lost, inner-fiscally conservative self. He's 
going to cast the first veto of his Presidency on a bill that would 
spend money, after an orgy of borrowing, spending and misspending on 
many dubious things. His target, 10 million low-income kids.

The President stands on principle. Or is it he's standing on a pile 
of campaign cash contributed by the insurance industry to the 
Republicans?
