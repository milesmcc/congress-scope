`Mr. WILSON of South Carolina â€” 10 September 2007`

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank 
Australia for their continued commitment to the global war on terrorism 
and to recognize our long and proud history of working together to 
promote democracy and freedom around the world. Australia is the only 
country to have fought beside us in every major conflict of the 20th 
and 21st centuries.

President Bush and Prime Minister John Howard reaffirmed our 
friendship last week by signing a defense trade cooperation treaty. As 
a partner in the fight against terrorism, Australia has committed 
troops and resources to assist our Armed Forces around the world. They 
have deployed 1,500 troops in Iraq and 970 in Afghanistan.

While our friendship and partnership extends well beyond defense, it 
is comforting and reassuring to have such a dedicated ally who 
understands that we must stop our enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan to 
protect American and Australian families and all those who share the 
values of freedom and democracy around the world.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
