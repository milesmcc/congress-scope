Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Georgia's 
finest! On May 11, 2010 in Charkh Afghanistan, an American Hero named 
Seargent Kendra Coleman of The 173rd Special Troops Battalion Airborne, 
United States Army almost lost her life in an IED explosion. Clinging 
to life, and losing her leg she had a choice to make, give up or get 
up! She chose to get up and begin her run to recovery! In just a few 
short months she traveled so far and so fast in her recovery. The 
strides she has made, have taught us all so much, and will continue to 
bless us all. She is a shining example of the type of women and men who 
serve our Nation in The United States Armed Forces, and their families 
quiet courage who help them to recover. Kendra and her husband Brandon, 
are rebuilding their life at record pace, and they make us all proud to 
be Americans. I ask that this poem penned in honor of them by Albert 
Caswell be placed in the Record.
