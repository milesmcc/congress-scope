Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this 
legislation and salute the bill's sponsor, Barbara Lee from California, 
as a courageous and clear voice in this Congress.

It's interesting listening to this debate that there seems to be no 
disagreement about a resolution that will help build stability in Iraq, 
as others have said. It will make clear that the U.S. is not an 
occupying force, and it will deny al Qaeda a key recruiting tool.

It is also clear that we are not prohibiting a U.S. presence in the 
region, even a U.S. temporary presence in Iraq. We have bases in other 
neighboring countries and the Middle East, and we will have an over-
the-horizon force.

I'm really surprised that not only is the White House refusing to 
follow the law, but those senior White House officials with whom I've 
spoken numerous times about this issue all seem to agree we don't need 
a permanent military presence, and yet, stubbornly, they refuse to make 
clear that we won't have one.

Pass this resolution. Let's do the right thing. Congress, as an 
article I body, needs to get this White House to follow the law.
