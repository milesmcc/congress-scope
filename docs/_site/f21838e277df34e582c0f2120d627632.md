`Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 4 September 2007`

---


Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my 
friend from Texas for yielding and thank you for giving me the 
opportunity to visit Iraq.

Being from Tennessee, the Volunteer State, I volunteered to visit the 
men and women in uniform in Iraq. I wasn't disappointed. Our troops are 
well trained, well motivated, and successful.

After the fall of Saddam, the Iraqi people had a choice to make. They 
have lived for decades under totalitarian rule. Over the past 4 years, 
they've been divided and, quite frankly, confused about who their 
friends and allies really are. Is it the radical extremists such as al 
Qaeda or is it us?

During my visit to Iraq, I visited Ramadi, which until a few months 
ago was a killing field. For the past 4 years, the people of Ramadi 
were caught in a decision-making battle of which group, us or the 
extremists, offered them the best chance for a normal and free future.

The insurgent extremist chose to win the local people over with the 
use of force, force against their American troops and against any local 
who did not support their radical agenda. Our troops, on the other 
hand, have reached out in friendship and support.

The local people, seeing the difference, have chosen to have their 
lives returned to normal and live in freedom. Therefore, Ramadi has 
gone from a city of death and destruction to one of


rebuilding and hope. I was able to see it firsthand during my visit in 
July.

As I walked throughout the busy city market, it was very uplifting to 
see the local people interacting with our American troops in a very 
positive way. Now that the surge is under way, our troops are actually 
living in the city as trusted friends and allies. We're working with 
the local mayor and his directors to rebuild and totally rejuvenate the 
city. The city of Ramadi is located in al Anbar, a city that Chris just 
mentioned moments ago as being a lost hope at the end of the year.

Of course, these relationships take time to develop, but the time and 
effort are worth it. Helping the Iraqi people secure their freedom 
helps us to defeat global extremists and, therefore, secure our own 
freedoms for generations to come.

We have to be successful as well. Ronald Reagan once said, ''We win, 
they lose.'' If we choose not to succeed, that statement will be just 
the opposite: we lose, they win.

You may ask, who are they and why does it matter to me anyway? They 
are not the Iraqi people. I had the opportunity to meet with some of 
them during my visit. The Iraqi people are really no different than any 
of us. They want to live in a secure and safe country, have a job to go 
to in the mornings, be able to clothe and feed their families, walk 
across the street without fear of being shot or blown up, find 
reasonable health care, and to worship freely. These are the same 
things that any American mother and father would want for their 
children.

So who are our enemy in Iraq and other parts of the world? They're 
radical extremists who are willing to kill innocent men, women and even 
children to spread their ideology of hate.

We, the American people, have been lulled into believing that this is 
the President's war on the Iraqi people. Nothing could be further from 
the truth. The Iraqi people and the Iraqi Government see us as 
liberators from an oppressive regime, but they are just now learning 
how to live as a free people. Our common enemy do not want them to live 
free and productive lives. That would go against their ideology of 
hate, an ideology that they want to spread around the world, perhaps to 
a neighborhood near you.

We cannot let that happen. We either win and they lose, or they win 
and we lose. That is too big a price to pay. This Congress owes it to 
everyone involved to succeed, from the Iraqi people to our brave men 
and women in uniform who are serving on the frontlines of battle, to 
the American people. We cannot afford to lose. The price is too high 
and the cost is too much. Freedom isn't free. It has to be earned. It 
has to be cherished.

We're in a fight for the generations that will come after us. This 
battle isn't about a small hot desert land somewhere in the Middle East 
that most Americans will never visit or even easily find on a globe. 
This battle is about our future and that of our children and 
grandchildren.

We want the same things for our children that Iraqi mothers and 
fathers do for their children. We want to live in a secure and safe 
country, to have a job to go to in the mornings, be able to clothe and 
feed our families, walk across the street without having the fear of 
being blown up or shot, find reasonable health care and to worship 
freely. But our enemy, the radical extremists, want to deny us and our 
future generations those freedoms. They have proved it time and time 
again: for instance, the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979 where 52 
Americans were held for 444 days, or the bombing of the Marine Corps 
barracks in Beirut where 241 marines lost their lives in 1983, or the 
first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, or the attack on the 
USS Cole claiming the lives of 17 sailors, or the deadly attack on 
September 11, where almost 3,000 Americans died.

We can either choose to fight and win the battle now or choose to 
lose the battle now and leave it for our children to fight.

A sentiment relayed to me by a general in Iraq was very simple, and 
it drove this point home. Our men and women in uniform are not fighting 
only for the 8-year-old Iraqi child and their security but also for the 
8-year-old American child and for their current and future security and 
freedom. We do not want them to grow up to have to fight this battle 
that we chose not to finish.

As I mentioned, our enemy has proven they're dedicated and willing to 
shed American blood on American soil. Do we really want to tie our 
hands to the point that we encourage failure over success in Iraq in 
this global war on terror? Do we really want to live in an America 
where our future generations have to fear going to the park, going to 
the mall, going to school or to work? I don't think so and I sure hope 
not.



The choice is ours today. The American people, when provided with the 
facts, will choose freedom and security every time. I say, we win, they 
lose. The cost to the American family is just too great to allow any 
other outcome.

May God bless America and keep her strong and secure for generations 
to come.
