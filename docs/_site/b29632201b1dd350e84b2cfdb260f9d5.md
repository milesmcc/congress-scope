Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and praise Army PFC 
Daniel Courneya, a constituent of mine who died while serving his 
country in Iraq; PFC Courneya's convoy was ambushed in Iraq on May 12, 
2007.

PFC Courneya of Vermontville was 19 years old. He grew up dreaming of 
serving in the military. Daniel grew up wishing to carry on the legacy 
of service to our great Nation which has run through his family. He 
grew up with the heart of a hero. Enlisting in the United States Army 
at 17 years old during his senior year of high school, his mother had 
to sign a waiver to allow her son to enlist.

As a student at Maple Valley High School, Daniel was well known and 
well respected. Daniel ran track at Maple Valley, played on the soccer 
team and played the clarinet in the school band.

In Vermontville, the members of the community hold parades to welcome 
home returning members of the military and have done so to honor PFC 
Courneya. What impresses me the most is the way the community has 
rallied around Daniel's family and provided caring support during this 
time of grieving.

My thoughts and prayers are with Daniel's family. I thank them for 
their beloved sons' dedicated service to the United States. May God be 
with them.
