Mr. DINGELL. I want to also express great respect and affection for 
the gentlewoman from Ohio, Ms. Kaptur. As a veteran myself, I couldn't 
agree more that we need more quality care for our veterans in a timely 
manner. As already mentioned, given the increased workload because of 
the veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, doubling the size of 
the existing clinic will help us to meet that goal.
