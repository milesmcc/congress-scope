## `2a3e0ba5b07582ad2b4c96b7dccc3f89`
`Mr. PRICE of North Carolina â€” 21 June 2010`

---


Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend 
to my colleagues' attention a recent public address by the gentleman 
from California, Mr. Dreier, on the occasion of Memorial Day. For the 
past five years, I have had the privilege of serving with Mr. Dreier on 
the House Democracy Partnership, a bipartisan commission established by 
the House of Representatives in 2005 that works to strengthen the 
capacity of legislatures in emerging and developing democracies around 
the world. Mr. Dreier was the commission's first chairman and now 
serves as its ranking Republican member. As the current chairman, I 
have had the privilege of working closely with him as we have sought to 
support our fellow legislators and their staffs in countries ranging 
from Haiti and Peru to Indonesia and East Timor.

On this Memorial Day, Mr. Dreier reflected on the work of the House 
Democracy Partnership and the relationship between the sacrifices made 
by our nation's men and women in uniform and the cause of freedom 
around the world. I have included his eloquent remarks in their 
entirety below:




 I have been privileged to stand here on several previous 


 occasions, and have had the honor of getting to know many of 


 you. Every year we come together on Memorial Day to remember 


 the war dead and to honor their service. We are humbled by 


 their sacrifice. But I believe we honor them fully not just 


 in solemn remembrance, but in commemorating their legacy as 


 well.



 Their legacy, first and foremost, is our 221-year history 


 as a nation that was founded in, and has prospered by, a 


 commitment to liberty. We have faced many crises. But we have 


 endured because the men and women of our armed forces have 


 fought to defend the principles on which our country was 


 built.



 These principles are enduring because they are universal. 


 Across all cultural and geographic boundaries, people want to 


 live in liberty. Which is why the legacy of those we honor 


 today is evidenced not just here at home, but in the many 


 fledgling democracies around the world. Democratic governance 


 is taking hold in places that previously knew only 


 totalitarianism or military dictatorship, like Macedonia and 


 Indonesia. Places that were plagued with violence and chaos, 


 like Colombia and Liberia. Places that were controlled by a 


 foreign power, like East Timor and Kosovo.



 In some of these places, our military has played a direct 


 role, such as the former Yugoslavia. But their greatest 


 influence has been simply in defending the principles that 


 offer the only path to lasting peace. We have seen throughout 


 our history that wherever there is tyranny, there can be no 


 real security. Wherever repression and poverty allow 


 resentments and extremism to spread, violence will always 


 follow. And because repression's greatest enemy is liberty, 


 the violence that follows will always threaten our security 


 and our interests.



 In recognition of this fact, I had the privilege of 


 founding a commission in the House of Representatives called 


 the House Democracy Partnership. For the last five years, 


 this commission has worked with a number of new and 


 reemerging democracies, like those I named before, to provide 


 support and assistance in their quest to solidify their 


 democratic gains. As we engage with the popularly elected 


 representatives of these countries, the legacy of our armed 


 forces provides the context for this work. We act with the 


 knowledge that their sacrifice is what has enabled the United 


 States to serve as a model for the rest of the world, and the 


 recognition that failure to see democracy take hold threatens 


 our security.



 Of the 15 countries with which the House Democracy 


 Partnership is currently working, the stakes are highest in 


 Afghanistan and Pakistan, ground zero for the struggle 


 against violent extremism. Nearly 100,000 of




 our men and women in uniform are currently in harm's way in 


 the region, as we all know very well. They are doing what 


 they have always done: valiantly defending the people of the 


 United States. But we want them to be able to complete their 


 mission and come home as soon as possible.



 That means that the Afghan people must build a stable, 


 peaceful, democratic government that will neither threaten 


 the U.S. nor allow a breeding ground for terrorism to once 


 again take root. As difficult as that process is, the right 


 seeds have been planted. I have seen former adversaries in 


 war sit around a table in Kabul, discussing the path forward 


 for the Afghan people. I have worked with legislators in 


 Islamabad who are determined to root out all forms of 


 terrorism until it is completely eradicated from Pakistani 


 territory.



 These democratic efforts are made possible by the work that 


 our troops are doing. Our service members are working to 


 create the security and political space for these efforts to 


 be successful. This is a Herculean task that can seem 


 impossible at times. But if our nation's history demonstrates 


 anything, it is the power of liberty and democratic 


 principles. And our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and 


 guardsmen have been their guarantor for 221 years. Today we 


 honor all who have served, all who have made the ultimate 


 sacrifice, and all who are currently in harm's way. And we 


 honor them with the recognition that the fruit of their 


 sacrifice is evident not just here at home, but around the 


 globe.
