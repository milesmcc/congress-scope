Mr. JASON ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an 
American hero, Marine SGT Michael A. Marzano. Last Tuesday, March 20, I 
joined my colleague, Congressman Phil English, in introducing H.R. 
1594, legislation to name the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient 
Clinic in Hermitage, Pennsylvania in Sergeant Marzano's honor.

In December 2004, Sergeant Marzano volunteered for a tour of duty in 
Iraq and joined Ohio's 3rd Battalion, 25th Regiment of the 4th Marine 
Division. He served honorably as a member of a Mobile Assault Platoon. 
On May 8, 2005, Sergeant Marzano was killed by a suicide bomber while 
taking part in an offensive against insurgents in the city of Haditha, 
Al-Anbar Province, Iraq.

Sergeant Marzano was the first soldier from Mercer County to die in 
either Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom. He 
exemplified the core values of honor, courage and commitment to a 
grateful nation and community. This designation will honor his memory 
and recognize his bravery and sacrifice. He is representative of all of 
Mercer County's veterans who have worn the uniform proudly, upheld the 
military's traditions of courage and faithful service, and stood ready, 
if duty required it, to make the ultimate sacrifice.
