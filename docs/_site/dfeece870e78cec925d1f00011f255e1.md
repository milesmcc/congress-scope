Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.

This week, the White House announced that it foresees American troops 
in Iraq into at least 2009, and the President has even gone so far as 
to suggest that our presence in Iraq may evolve to look like our 
presence in South Korea. We've had troops stationed in South Korea--on 
permanent bases--for over 50 years. This resolution says clearly to the 
President and the people of Iraq that we will not turn our temporary 
presence in Iraq into a permanent one. The Congress should take 
whatever additional measures are necessary to ensure that no funds are 
expended for the construction of permanent bases in that country, and 
to that end I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure.
