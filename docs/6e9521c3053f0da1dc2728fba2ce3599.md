Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on legislation 
to set a path for the responsible redeployment of American troops from 
Iraq. I will support this bill because it will end American involvement 
in the Iraqi civil war and bring our troops safely home.

This week marks the fourth anniversary of a war born in deceit and 
prolonged by mismanagement. I voted against the invasion in 2002; I 
will vote now to end this war by supporting the Iraq Accountability Act 
with its benchmarks and timetables for redeploying U.S. forces from 
Iraq.

For 4 years, previous Congresses neglected their oversight 
responsibilities while the administration made mistake after mistake. 
The congressional majority failed to conduct thorough investigations, 
demand accountability, or offer policy alternatives. We have paid a 
steep price for that neglect, including the lives of more than 3,200 
American Armed Forces, with another 24,000 wounded, many critically.

The new Congress is providing long overdue leadership, taking action 
to end U.S. involvement in a civil war with no end in sight. 
Responsible military disengagement from Iraq is in the national 
security interests of the United States. There are no easy, cost-free 
options. But our perpetual presence in Iraq has sapped our military 
strength, undermined our credibility around the world, and limited our 
investments in domestic priorities like health care and education.

This week, the House of Representatives has a choice: Either endorse 
the President's open-ended commitment, or adopt a plan that demands 
accountability, sets a timeline for redeployment, and restores the 
readiness of our Armed Forces.

The President's strategy of indefinite intervention is simply not 
sustainable. The situation in Iraq has moved beyond our military's 
ability to shape events in a positive direction. Extending our presence 
merely delays our ability to recover the ground we have lost, our 
diplomatic initiative, our global reputation, and the broken state of 
our ground forces.

The Iraq Accountability Act has three key components:

First, it uses President Bush's own benchmarks to require the Iraqis 
to assume responsibility for their own security. If they meet those 
benchmarks, all American forces would leave Iraq by the summer of 2008. 
If they do not, American forces will leave as early as the end of this 
year.

Second, the bill supports our Armed Forces by requiring the President 
to certify that any troops deployed to Iraq are fully and properly 
equipped, and that their deployment follows Department of Defense 
standards for readiness and rest between deployments.

Third, it provides funds needed to ensure that returning troops and 
veterans receive the best possible health care and other services they 
deserve.

The American people expect us to say where we stand on the war in 
Iraq. By supporting the Iraq Accountability Act we are voting to use 
the long-neglected powers of Congress to bring U.S. involvement in the 
Iraqi civil war to an end. I urge, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Iraq Accountability Act when it comes to the floor 
tomorrow.
