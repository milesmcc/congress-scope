Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there are few bills that we deal with in 
Washington, DC, that are more critical to the safety and well-being of 
our communities than the bill we are considering on the floor today. 
This legislation is going to help fund Federal law enforcement and 
justice programs that are absolutely essential if we are going to keep 
our neighborhoods safe, keep our justice system strong, and make sure 
our communities are healthy. At a time when our budgets are very tight 
and our needs are very great, I believe this bill invests in the right 
priorities. I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for their 
leadership and their very hard work to put this bill together.

But as all of us in this Chamber know, despite their hard work and 
leadership at their subcommittee to make a sound investment in the 
health of our communities, the President has said he will veto this 
bill. According to the administration, the additional funding in this 
bill is ''irresponsible and excessive.''

That is very hard to fathom when this administration is asking for 
over $190 billion in emergency appropriations to fight the wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan for 1 year. While this President easily is spending our 
money overseas, local communities in my home State and around the 
country are going without the money they need for very critical 
programs.

The increases this legislation calls for are a fraction of what this 
President spends on the wars in a year. The money in this bill will go 
to revitalize programs that have been overlooked by this 
administration. My home State, for example, is experiencing a dangerous 
shortage of FBI agents who do essential work to ensure that we prevent 
another terrorist attack at home and who perform critical law 
enforcement duties. That shortage is one example of how this President 
mixed up the Nation's priorities. But this bill does make a small step 
toward fixing some of those years of problems.

In my home State, the lack of FBI agents for critical law enforcement 
needs has been a serious concern for some time, but the urgency of this 
situation was driven home recently in a series of articles by the 
Seattle Post-


Intelligencer. The paper's first article noted that since 9/11:



 the White House and the Justice Department have failed to 


 replace at least 2,400 agents, transferred from law 


 enforcement to counterterrorism, leaving far fewer agents on 


 the trail of identity thieves, con-artists, hate mongers and 


 other criminals.


The article I referred to found that Washington State has a mere 2.1 
FBI agents for every 100,000 residents. That is nearly half the 
national average.

This past week, I met with police chiefs and sheriffs from across my 
State, and they agreed this shift has had a real impact on State and 
local law enforcement. One police chief told me the FBI had virtually 
disappeared from white collar crime investigations. A sheriff told me 
the local law enforcement now investigates and prosecutes over 90 
percent of all bank robberies, even though this has traditionally been 
a FBI responsibility.

Another police chief told me the FBI does not have the law 
enforcement resources to adequately staff antigang task forces, even as 
the gang presence and gang-related crime increases in our communities.

All of these sheriffs and police chiefs had nothing but praise for 
the essential work that FBI agents perform in their communities. But 
even as the FBI focuses on counterterrorism, they ask that it not 
abandon law enforcement. The Seattle FBI field office has remained 
understaffed even for counterterrorism agents. That is especially 
troubling because Washington State's industry-leading companies, 
international seaports, and important military facilities make it a 
prime target for a terrorist attack. Three years from now, thousands of 
people are going to travel through my home State to attend the 2010 
Vancouver Winter Olympics. We have to be prepared for the worst. 
Currently, Washington State ranks 35th in per capita FBI agents. 
Clearly, that makes no sense.

I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for working with me on 
this issue; specifically an amendment that would end this disconnect 
and ensure we are placing our FBI agents where they can best protect 
our communities. It will also get the FBI to tell us how it intends to 
distribute its resources.

That amendment is the first step toward ensuring that the FBI's 
priorities are in sync with our country's security needs and its own 
stated priorities. I commend Senator Mikulski for her recognition of 
that need. Her work to include additional funding for the FBI in this 
bill is a very good first step. The next step is to increase funding to 
hire, train, and place new FBI agents throughout the country that will 
help to ease the burden the FBI has had to bear since 9/11 changed its 
mission.

But I think we all know more funding is needed. Unfortunately, if 
this President believes that increasing our FBI budget is irresponsible 
and excessive and plans to veto this bill, we will not be able to make 
the necessary investments today that will make our country more secure 
tomorrow.


While Federal agents are critically important to maintaining the 
security of our country, we all know that State and local law 
enforcement are the real guardians for our communities. In this post-9/
11 world, we have asked them to place counterterrorism at the top of 
their priorities.

But criminals have not stopped abusing children or robbing stores or 
dealing drugs. The local police have been told they need to do more 
with less, but we have reached a point today where we simply cannot ask 
them to do more without help.

A recent FBI crime report showed that after a decade of declines, 
violent crime is now rising for the second straight year. We have to 
make sure it doesn't rise again. This bill restores funding for our 
State and local law enforcement to nearly $2.7 billion and fills a 
major gap, after the President cut its budget in half. This will also 
provide $1.4 billion for State and local law enforcement grants, 
including $550 million for COPS grants, and over $100 million for Byrne 
grants. These funds are critically important and they support antidrug 
and antigang task forces around the country.

They fund communications equipment that helps our police and our 
emergency response teams talk to each other, something we all know is 
desperately needed in all our communities.

They fund critical programs to deal with the spread of 
methamphetamine, and police chiefs and sheriffs have consistently told 
me these grants were absolutely essential to their ability to protect 
our communities. Unfortunately, as I said, we have heard the President 
say he is going to veto this legislation. This bill addresses critical 
priorities across our country and I urge all my colleagues to support 
the bill and send the President a message from our constituents at home 
that he is taking our country's safety and economic well-being in the 
wrong direction and that we need to change focus and give our 
communities what they need to be safe and sound and secure.

This bill also addresses vital commercial and economic interests 
across the Nation.

In my home State, that means helping to ensure a healthy, sustainable 
salmon population. In Washington State, healthy salmon mean a healthy 
economy. That's why I am thankful that this bill includes $90 million 
in funding for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. This money 
will help support our State's coordinated effort to restore salmon runs 
and preserve a way of life in the Pacific Northwest.

When I talk with leaders in my home State about the need to restore 
our salmon populations, they call it critical.

When I go home and discuss with law enforcement officials, experts 
and the media, about the need to increase the number of FBI agents, 
they say it is an urgent problem.

When I talk to local police and sheriffs about the need for COPS and 
Byrne grants, they say these grants are crucial to the security and 
safety of our communities.

Yet when I return to Washington, DC, I am told by this President that 
the money that is so desperately needed at home is ''irresponsible and 
excessive.''

It could not be clearer that this Administration is out of step with 
the priorities of the people of State and the people of this country.

We have presented the President a measured, responsible bill to 
bolster our security and build our economy, and I understand he has 
decided to reject it.

I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and send the President 
a message from our constituents at home: That he is taking our 
country's safety and economic well-being in the wrong direction, and 
that we need to change focus and give our communities what they need to 
be safe, and sound, and secure.
