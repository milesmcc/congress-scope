# THE FALLEN HERO COMMEMORATION ACT
## `e062d335b2554baf4f64d30b6acaf36c`
`Mr. JONES â€” 23 February 2009`

---


Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, throughout the history of our Nation, members 
of the United States Armed Forces have given their lives to secure and 
protect the freedoms America enjoys today. Today U.S. servicemembers 
are serving our Nation in Iraq, Afghanistan and many other parts of the 
world. Without a loved one serving in our military, it is all too 
possible for Americans to overlook the sacrifices that have been made 
and continue to be made by the men and women of the armed services.

It is for this reason that I have introduced H.R. 269, the Fallen 
Hero Commemoration Act. This legislation


would require the Department of Defense to permit media coverage when 
the remains of troops who had died in active duty arrive at military 
installations in the United States.

Currently, the Department of Defense does not, does not permit 
arrival ceremonies for or media coverage of deceased military personnel 
returning or departing from United States military installations. This 
ban on media coverage has been in place since the Persian Gulf War in 
1991. However, earlier this month President Obama announced that he had 
ordered a review of this policy, and the Pentagon is expected to 
complete its review soon.

While I welcome a decision by the current administration to repeal 
this ban on media coverage, enacting the Fallen Hero Commemoration Act 
would ensure by statute that our Nation properly commemorates the 
service of our fallen heroes now and in the years to come.

If this legislation is enacted, the privacy of military families 
would be protected. Private memorial services would remain private and 
only credentialed media, as approved by the Department of Defense, 
would be permitted to cover the arrival of fallen heroes at U.S. 
military installations.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit for the record two letters I have 
received in support of the Fallen Hero Commemoration Act.

One letter is an endorsement from the American Society of News 
Editors, and the other is from the National Press Photographers 
Association.

As Mickey Osterreicher, father of a newly commissioned Air Force 
second lieutenant and general counsel for the National Press 
Photographers Association, wrote in a letter that is submitted--and I 
would like to read just a paragraph. ''It is one thing for a family to 
request that we not cover a private event it is another for the 
military to impose a total ban.''

This legislation would not only honor those who have given their 
lives in defense of our Nation, but also uphold the freedoms for which 
they gave the ultimate sacrifice.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I hope that my colleagues here on the House 
floor will look seriously at H.R. 269 so that we may properly 
commemorate the sacrifices made by the United States servicemembers. 
And, Mr. Speaker, I have signed well over 8,000 letters to families and 
extended families who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and Iraq.

So I want to close by asking God to please bless our men and women in 
uniform; ask God to please bless the families who have given a loved 
one in Afghanistan and Iraq; and I ask God to please, three times, God 
please continue to bless America; please, God, continue to bless 
America; please, God, continue to bless America.




 National Press Photographers Association, Inc., The 





 Society of Professional Photojournalists,


















 Durham, NC. January 12, 2009.


 Hon. Walter Jones,


 Rayburn House Office Building,


 Washington, DC.



 Dear Congressman Jones: As general counsel for the National 


 Press Photographers Association (NPPA) I would like to thank 


 you for your introduction of H.R. 269, the ''Fallen Hero 


 Commemoration Act.'' It is my understanding that this 


 legislation would direct the ''Secretary of Defense to grant 


 access to accredited members of the media when the remains of 


 members of the Armed Forces arrive at military installations 


 in the United States.''



 The NPPA represents almost 10,000 still and video 


 photojournalists throughout the United States. As such we are 


 very aware that the Department of Defense currently prohibits 


 media coverage of these solemn ceremonies. Throughout our 


 history photojournalists have documented every aspect of 


 human endeavor from triumphs to tragedies. It is unfortunate 


 that war often times creates the most compelling images. From 


 Matthew Brady's graphic photos of Civil War battlefields to 


 Joe Rosenthal's raising of the American Flag on Iwo Jima news 


 photographers have risked (and all too often lost) their 


 lives to capture these moments so that the public may be 


 informed of these newsworthy events. A free, robust and 


 unfettered press is as much a part of our history and culture 


 as is the Constitution and the three branches of government.



 To deny media coverage of the return of our fallen heroes 


 is a brazen attempt by the military to deny history. While 


 our government tries to bring liberty and democracy to all 


 corners of the world it lately seems to have forgotten that 


 those freedoms are no less important at home. As a former 


 photojournalist for over thirty years and the father of a 


 newly commissioned 2nd Lt. in the USAF training to one day 


 fly A-l0's I can state unequivocally that my colleagues mean 


 no disrespect to the uniform or the families when we cover 


 these moving events. Quite the opposite is true--as 


 photojournalists try to honestly and accurately depict these 


 moments for all to see. It is one thing for a family to 


 request that we not cover a private event it is another for 


 the military to impose a total ban.



 We agree that by once again permitting access to accredited 


 members of the media at the arrival of the remains of fallen 


 service members at U.S. military installations, this 


 legislation would not only honor those who have given their 


 lives in defense of our Nation but also uphold the freedoms 


 for which they gave the ultimate sacrifice.



 Please feel free to contact me should you need anything 


 further. In the past members of NPPA have testified at 


 hearings on a number of issues related to photojournalism and 


 we would be more than happy to do so again should the need 


 arise.





 Very truly yours,





















 Mickey H. Osterreicher,


 General Counsel.
