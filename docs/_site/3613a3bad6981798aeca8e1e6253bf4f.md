Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this opportunity 
to speak. I rise in support of this legislation.

Much has been said these past years about the extent of the U.S. 
engagement in Iraq. The Iraqi people have made progress. Saddam is 
gone. They have had elections. We are told they have got over 300,000 
Iraqi police and soldiers trained, equipped, and in the field. They are 
engaged in a civil war, and we cannot be involved in trying to referee 
that. As well as others in this body, I have been given assurances that 
they have that many troops.

I believe the war in Iraq has had a serious negative effect on the 
readiness of our brave men and women in uniform who are serving with 
honor and distinction. Their deployments and, oftentimes, redeployments 
without adequate time at home to rest and train is affecting our 
Nation's ability to meet future contingencies. As it stands today, 
listen up, as it stands today, we do not have, repeat, do not have a 
single combat-ready brigade ready to be deployed.

The United States cannot chart the destiny of the people of Iraq. The 
Iraqi Government must take responsibility for its own nation, and this 
legislation puts us on the path to see to that worthy and noble cause.
