`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 27 February 2007`

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. If you sort of listen to the rhetoric 
coming out of the administration, you would think this grand coalition 
has, what, 50 percent American troops, 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 
percent? No. Ninety-two percent. Ninety-two percent of the troops on 
the ground in Iraq are American forces. We went from a high of 
coalition troops, those are non-American troops, of 25,000, and now 
down to almost below 15,000 troops and dropping by the day.

So I think that is just a point of information that we have now 
decided on a path that isn't even going to have a hint of coalition-
building. We have decided to go this on our own. And, frankly, I think 
that has grievous consequences for what is happening on the ground in 
Iraq, frankly has just as important consequences for the future of 
foreign policy when we have gotten to a point where we don't even talk 
to our allies about our strategy there.

And I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Florida.
