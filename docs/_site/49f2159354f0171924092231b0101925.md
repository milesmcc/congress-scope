Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of 1st Marine 
Lt. Scott Fleming who gave his life September 17, 2010, while 
supporting combat operations in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. 
His unit was conducting pre-election security operations when he was 
struck by enemy small arms fire.

Scott Fleming was a sophomore at Blessed Trinity High School in 
Roswell, GA on September 11, 2001. It was those attacks that led him to 
the decision to join the Marines. He began his training just two weeks 
after graduating from LaGrange College with a degree in Education.

1st LT. Fleming will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with 
full military honors. He is survived by his father, Joseph and mother, 
Joanne; wife, Brandi; and sister, Andrea.

Madam Speaker, it is with the greatest respect and admiration that we 
honor 1st Lt. Fleming's sacrifice on behalf of our nation. He is a hero 
to his countrymen, his family, and his fellow Marines. He reminds us 
that America is blessed to have so many young men and women willing to 
stand up and fight to preserve our precious freedoms. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his family and all our military families, whose 
selfless dedication to this Nation is an inspiration to us all.
