# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `40811fbc1f0b99417d7876597e158230`
`Mr. HUNTER â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself just 30 seconds, and I would 
like to just make one note. That is, if we add the 21,500 troops that 
are already partly in Iraq, these reinforcements to the 138 who existed 
before the movement started, and we allow for the troops who are 
rotating home, we will have fewer; we will have 157,000 troops in Iraq, 
according to DOD. That is fewer than the number of troops that we had a 
year ago in December. That is the state of this so-called surge; fewer 
troops than we had last year.

Mr. Speaker, at this point I would yield such time as he may consume 
to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) who, for a 
number of years, chaired the Terrorism Subcommittee and is now the 
ranking member.
