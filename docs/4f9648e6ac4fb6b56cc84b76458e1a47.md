Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, on June 2, Illinois lost another great 
American hero when Corporal Jeremiah Costello of Carlinville was killed 
in Iraq by an IED.

Corporal Costello joined the Army in pursuit of becoming an Illinois 
state trooper, leaving his 4-year-old daughter in the care of his 
mother and stepfather. Like the 21,000 single parents serving in Iraq, 
Corporal Costello struggled with being away from his daughter, yet he 
bravely fought with courage.

Corporal Costello was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the 
Purple Heart. He is remembered as a cheerful young man with a knack for 
improving people's moods and surprising loved ones with gifts.

As Father's Day approaches, I ask my colleagues to remember Corporal 
Costello and his 4-year-old daughter, Lilly, and the approximately 
2,000 children who have lost a parent in the Armed Forces over the last 
5 years.

On behalf of the 17th Congressional District of Illinois, I extend my 
thoughts and prayers to the Costello family. Corporal Costello's 
service to his country will not be forgotten, and a grateful Nation 
stands humble. Thank you, Corporal Costello.
