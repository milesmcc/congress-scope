Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues--and I again thank 
the chairman, Senator Levin. I think we have had an excellent degree of 
accommodation, with occasional differences of opinion. But I appreciate 
his leadership. I remind my colleagues this is the 12th day of debate 
on this bill. The total time of debate has been 69 hours. We still have 
not gotten to the body of the legislation. That is 12 days, 69 hours.

I know this is called a ''deliberative'' body, but we are now 
reaching the limits of that description. So I hope all of our 
colleagues will work with us to dispose--hopefully today--of the Iraq-
related amendments, and then we can close out the filing of amendments 
on the bill itself and, hopefully, have some kind of agreement to 
dispose of this legislation.

Again, as we have pointed out several times, on this legislation is 
the Wounded Warrior legislation, for our veterans, a pay raise, and so 
many other important aspects of the legislation. We don't want us, for 
the first time in more than 46 years, not to pass this important bill.

I yield the floor.
