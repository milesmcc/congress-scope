Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are still wrestling with the challenge 
of what to do about the supplemental appropriations that have been 
requested by the administration.

This morning, in our Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, chaired 
by the distinguished Chair's State colleague, Mr. Inouye, and also led 
on the Republican side by the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. 
Stevens, we heard testimony from the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Gates, 
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen. They 
drew a very frightening picture of what is happening to the military 
forces, not just in Iraq and Afghanistan and deployed elsewhere in the 
world, but also in our training accounts, many other support activities 
for our military, pay and allowances--all the accounts that fund the 
Department of Defense that have been included in the supplemental 
budget request are suffering and many are running dry. The accounts are 
running dry.

We are at a point that is past serious. I am not going to say it is 
desperate, but it certainly concerns this Senator that we continue to 
wait and wait and wait on Congress to act on the President's request 
for supplemental appropriations for our military forces at a time when 
they are engaged in military action overseas and protecting our 
security interests here at home. So I am pleased the Senate is taking 
up this request to fund activities in Afghanistan and Iraq and to 
respond to domestic natural disasters.

It is important that we act expeditiously to consider this 
legislation so we can reconcile our differences with the other body and 
with the President. The President submitted the bulk of his 
supplemental request in February 2007 in conjunction with his regular 
fiscal year 2008 budget submission. He did so because Congress clearly 
expressed its desire for a full-year estimate of war costs. But 
Congress did not appropriate a full year's funding. Instead, Congress 
approved a $70 billion bridge fund to support our operations in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. Enacting even that amount required a protracted 
struggle among the House, the Senate, and the President. As a result, 
the Department of Defense had to issue furlough notices, make a series 
of inefficient transfers and reprogrammings, and generally function in 
ways that detracted from its primary duties.

We find ourselves today facing a very similar situation. It has been 
more than 15 months since the President submitted this request. We have 
not approved or otherwise acted upon some $108 billion of that request.

The personnel and operations and maintenance accounts that support 
our activities in Iraq and Afghanistan are running low. This morning, 
Secretary Gates was asked about the consequences of this situation, and 
I am going to read into the Record, with the permission of my 
colleagues, some comments directly from that hearing this morning. This 
is Secretary Gates:




 There is, however, a more immediate concern. Congress has 


 yet to pass the pending $102.5 billion global war on terror 


 request for fiscal year 2008. And as a result, the Defense 


 Department is currently using fourth quarter funds from the 


 base budget to cover current war costs. Shortly, two critical 


 accounts will run dry. First, Army military personnel after 


 June 15. We will run out of funds in this account to pay 


 soldiers, including those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, 


 operations and maintenance accounts. Around July 5, O&M funds 


 across the services will run out, starting with the Army. 


 This may result in civilian furloughs, limits on training, 


 and curbing family support activities.



 If war funds are not available, the Defense Department can 


 transfer funds from Navy and Air Force military personnel 


 accounts to pay soldiers, but that would get us only to late 


 July. Using the limited transfer authority granted by 


 Congress would also help get us to late July. Doing so, 


 however, is a shell game which will disrupt existing programs 


 and push the services O&M accounts to the edge of fiscal 


 viability.


I could go on. He went on into some more detail about other accounts. 
I think we get the picture. I got the picture.

Our full subcommittee membership was in attendance for most of the 
hearing. I was disappointed that I was sitting there listening to the 
consequences of deliberate actions by the Congress to delay the 
availability of funding for our national defense, not just war funding 
for Iraq and Afghanistan; it has implications across the Department of 
Defense and into other accounts in other departments that are likewise 
affected by this denial of funding for our forces at a time when we 
need them to be fully prepared, fully trained, and fully engaged to 
help win the war against terror.

According to an earlier letter, so you won't get the impression that 
we have not been forewarned, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Gordon 
England, wrote us a letter on May 15 advising us that the Army would 
run out of military personnel funds by mid-June. He said if the 
supplemental legislation is not enacted by Memorial Day, the Department 
of Defense will be compelled to borrow funds from other services to 
finance Army operations into July and the Army would be out of options 
to pay its soldiers. He said the Department would be compelled to 
constrain expenditures from the Army operations and maintenance 
accounts. He said it will have to issue notices of potential furloughs 
of civilians funded from this account.

So we have been on notice from the Deputy Secretary and now this 
morning from the Secretary himself, as well as the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

We have been advised that the operations and maintenance accounts 
also fund the Commander's Emergency Response Program, a program that is 
critical to the success of our military commanders in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. He said those funds will run out in June.

I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record 
the letter from Secretary England.
