Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I read this evening with interest the 
President of the United States has threatened to veto the Defense bill 
if the additional funding exists for F-22 fighter planes.

Mr. Speaker, the President is absolutely right. And the real problem 
today is that opportunity to vote against those unnecessary planes are 
not allowed in this rule. In the end we have to stop spending more and 
start spending smarter.

I was extremely disappointed to learn that the administration's 
recommendation to halt the F-22 program was overridden. 187 F-22 Raptor 
fighter jets are not enough? The Raptor has not even been deployed to 
Iraq or Afghanistan, our two largest military fronts.

While I am not an expert on defense procurement, our Defense 
Secretary, Robert Gates, is. So I tend to believe him when he said that 
the notion of not buying 60 more F-22s imperils the national security 
of the United States is ''completely nonsense.''

We are far and away the most superior air force in the world. Why 
would we pour billions more into an area where we already dominate and 
continue to support an aircraft that is not suited to the current 
battlefields in which we fight? We have to invest in low-tech equipment 
such as unmanned drones, which are effective in those areas of 
conflict.

And always remember that every defense dollar spent to bolster an 
area where we already dominate is a dollar we don't have to spend to 
take care of our soldiers, strengthen our forces, and improve in areas 
where we may be vulnerable and our soldiers may be vulnerable.

Again, we have to simply stop spending more and start spending 
smarter. Our soldiers deserve it. The taxpayers deserve it.
