Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the resolution before the Senate honors 
the sacrifice of the members of our Armed Forces who have given their 
lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is fitting that we honor their 
service and their sacrifice.

The resolution states that sacrifices of the fallen are in keeping 
with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air 
Force and Coast Guard. These selfless Americans have upheld the fine 
traditions of those who fought at Guadalcanal, Inchon, in Vietnam, 
Korea, Gettysburg, and Trenton.

We have lost 69 brave volunteers from Kentucky. They are not 
forgotten by their families, they are not forgotten by the U.S. Senate, 
and they are not forgotten by those who carry on the fight.
