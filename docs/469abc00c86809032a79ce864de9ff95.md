Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Victory in Iraq 
Caucus, I continue to stand and support our troops. I feel it is 
imperative that we continue to strongly speak out in favor of the 
efforts that our troops are carrying out against terrorism, not only in 
Iraq, but in 30 different countries around the globe.

The terrorists tell us, just as my colleague said, that Iraq is the 
central battle in the war on terror. War is not quick, and it is not 
painless. It is up to us here in the people's House to continue to 
support the troops and to be behind their efforts, funding them 100 
percent of the way.

In order to win, Mr. Speaker, we must not only succeed on the 
battlefield; we must win in the battle of ideas. We must win the civic 
and economic battles with the Iraqi people. They are as critical as any 
firefight that they face every day.

The idea of freedom and prosperity is a powerful idea. Our coalition 
is breathing life into that idea with the Iraqi people. We need to 
stand firm, fund our troops, support our men and women in harm's way.
