`Mr. DAVIS of Illinois â€” 14 March 2007`

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
985, and I do so for a number of reasons. We all know that there are 
individuals who would love to simply be forthcoming with information. 
All of us have been places, all of us have worked places, all of us 
have known things, and we have all wanted to operate free and 
uninhibited. But unless individuals have the absolute protection, in 
many instances, of knowing that whatever it is that they would reveal 
that when they come forth that nobody can use that against them, 
because they also have concerns of their own relative to being able to 
maintain the job that they have got to take care of the security needs 
of their family.

Whistleblower protection could have been used more effectively even 
as we debated the issue of Iraq, as we made decisions based upon 
intelligence that supposedly we had but intelligence that obviously we 
did not have.

Whistleblower protection becomes very effective in helping to root 
out waste, fraud, and abuse. Some of the hearings that I have sat in on 
where we have discussed how we made use of our contracting resources in 
Iraq, for example, makes one wonder if we were just giving away the 
valuable resources of the American people.

So this legislation not only protects the taxpayers' money, but it 
also protects our troops, our soldiers, those who are in danger 
oftentimes because accurate information has not been deployed. Mr. 
Chairman, I urge passage of 985.
