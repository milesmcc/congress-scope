Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss 
of United States Army PFC Christopher Pfeifer of Nebraska. Private 
First Class Pfeifer died on September 25 from injuries he sustained 
near Kamu, Afghanistan, when insurgents attacked his unit on August 17. 
He was 21 years old.

Private First Class Pfeifer grew up in the small town of Spalding, 
NE, where he played eight-man football at Spalding Academy, as well as 
the drums in the band. He was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 91st 
Cavalry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in 
Schweinfurt, Germany. All the flags in Spalding, a town of about 600 
people, are at half-mast in honor of Private First Class Pfeifer.

Private First Class Pfeifer is remembered as a devoted husband, son, 
and brother. Sadly, he was denied the chance to become a proud father; 
his wife Karen gave birth to a baby girl the day after his death.

All of Nebraska is proud of Private First Class Pfeifer's service to 
our country, as well as the thousands of other brave Americans serving 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In addition to his wife and newborn daughter, he is survived by his 
parents, Mike and Dar, his brother Aaron, and his sister Nicki.

I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring PFC 
Christopher Pfeifer.
