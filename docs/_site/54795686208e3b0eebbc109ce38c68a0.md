Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to call my colleagues' 
attention to a recent blog post on the Jerusalem Post website, written 
by Abraham Foxman, the National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, 
ADL. Mr. Foxman challenges the idea that there is ''linkage'' between 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and other conflicts in the Middle 
East. It is both unrealistic and dangerous to believe that solving the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict will somehow solve our problems in Iran, 
Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and everywhere else in the Middle East. 
Distinct conflicts require distinct solutions and lumping them all 
together serves no one's interests, least of all our own. I highly 
recommend this excellent article.

 A Point of View: Linkage and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict














(By Abraham Foxman)




 No matter how many times it is proven to have no validity, 


 the theme of linking the




 Israeli-Palestinian conflict to broader issues in the region 


 rears its head over and over again. Zbigniew Brzezinski did 


 it in the 1970s, trying to blame Soviet influence in the 


 region on the absence of a solution to the Arab-Israeli 


 conflict. Prior to the first Gulf War, there were those who 


 opposed the war on the grounds that we needed first to 


 address the Palestinian issue before we could credibly 


 confront Saddam Hussein. And early on in the Obama 


 administration, reports were circulating suggesting that 


 American interests throughout the Middle East were dependent 


 on progress on the Palestinian-Israeli front.



 Henry Kissinger, in his magisterial two-volume memoir, 


 dealt with this matter head on. He demonstrated during the 


 Cold War that America's ability to further its broader 


 regional interests was connected not to a need to resolve the 


 Palestinian issue, but to showing America's moderate allies 


 in the region--Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the Gulf States--


 that it paid to be allied with America. The best way to prove 


 that? When Israel was under attack by regional extremists 


 supported by the Soviets, it was vital for the US to make 


 sure that Israel triumphed. By doing so, the moderates would 


 absorb the truth that the future lay with the US and its 


 allies. Standing up against radicals and with one's allies, 


 rather than blaming one's friends for problems in the region, 


 continues to be the best formula for serving US interests in 


 the Middle East.



 Now we are hearing the linkage theme once again. After the 


 brouhaha between the administration and the Israeli 


 government surfaced, a story emerged indicating that a 


 military team under General David Petraeus's CENTCOM command 


 reported to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. 


 Michael Mullen in January that Israel was jeopardizing US 


 standing in the region. And then Petraeus himself, speaking 


 before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 16, 


 reinforced this message. He stated that the Israeli-


 Palestinian conflict ''foments anti-American sentiment, due 


 to a perception of US favoritism for Israel.'' He went on to 


 say that ''Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits 


 the strength and depth of US partnerships with governments 


 and peoples in the AOR (Area of Responsibility) and weakens 


 the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world.''



 Once again, an illusion is at work here, one that will, if 


 pursued, invariably result in no real progress being made in 


 the region. We all want peace between Israel and the Arabs. 


 And putting more effort toward such a goal is a good thing. 


 What is not real, and is dangerous, is putting most of 


 America's eggs in the region in this basket.



 The Arab-Israeli conflict has never responded to such a 


 heavy emphasis. Progress is made when Arab leaders decide 


 it's time for peace. Maybe Assad of Syria is considering 


 this, and it should be explored. But that's very different 


 from placing this conflict at the center of everything. 


 Disappointment, as always, will follow since the gap between 


 what the Arabs want and Israel wants is substantial. 


 Moreover, Arab willingness to accept Israel's legitimacy as a 


 ''Jewish State'' is belied by everything that comes from Arab 


 leaders and Arab media.



 What inevitably happens if such unrealistic weight in the 


 region is given to the Israeli-Arab conflict is that Israel 


 comes to be seen as the problem. If only Israel would stop 


 settlements, if only Israel would talk with Hamas, if only 


 Israel would make concessions on refugees, if only it would 


 share Jerusalem, everything in the region would be fine. Iraq 


 would be fine. Afghanistan would be fine. Pakistan would be 


 fine. Iran would be fine. Lebanon would be fine.



 Of course, this is nonsense. These problems would remain 


 even if Israel did not exist. The result of such an approach 


 would be no progress on America's interests and great stress 


 in US-Israel relations.



 The Kissinger approach of strengthening moderates may be 


 tainted in some minds because it may be associated with 


 Bush's policy--but it doesn't have to be. One doesn't have to 


 be a Bush supporter to understand that the greatest need in 


 the region today is for victories by the moderates over the 


 radicals. In Israel's case, radical challenges exist from 


 Hamas in the south, Hizbullah and Syria in the north, and 


 Iran. All are complicated challenges. US support for a strong 


 and wise Israeli policy in response to these challenges will 


 provide the best opportunity to strengthen American 


 interests. Holding off Hamas, weakening Hizbullah, or 


 preventing Iran from gaining nuclear weapons will provide the 


 biggest boost to moderates throughout the Middle East. If the 


 Obama administration can help bring about one or more of 


 these accomplishments, it will go a long way to restoring 


 American influence in the region and, by the way, make 


 Israeli-Arab peace far more likely.



 This linkage trend, if continued, is dangerous and 


 counterproductive. It could undermine the historic bipartisan 


 support for Israel in America, a support based on moral and 


 strategic grounds, that has been--and still is--good for both 


 countries. It will reduce whatever incentive the Palestinians 


 have to reach a compromise peace with Israel; if America is 


 backing away from Israel, the Palestinians would reason, then 


 hopes of Israel's disappearance will be strengthened. It will 


 raise questions about American loyalty and credibility among 


 the Arabs who, despite their rhetoric criticizing US support 


 for Israel, would be far more distressed about the US 


 abandoning an ally.



 It diverts attention away from the larger challenges in the 


 region--Iran's nuclear program, and the challenge of Islamic 


 extremism and terrorism. Finally, it has the smell about it 


 of blaming the Jews for everything. The notion that al-


 Qaida's hatred of America or Iran's pursuit of nuclear 


 weapons or the ongoing threat of extremist terrorist groups 


 in the region is based on Israel's announcement of building 


 apartments is absurd on its face and smacks of scapegoating.



 It's time for the administration to step back not only from 


 the harsh rhetoric but also from the illusionary thinking 


 about Israel hurting American interests. America and Israel 


 can have their differences, but the US has no better ally 


 than Israel. The administration needs to recognize this and 


 find ways to reassure those who are raising concerns.
