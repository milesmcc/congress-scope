Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are all thankful for those comments 
given by our Members about the extraordinary bravery and heroism of our 
men and women who serve in the Armed Forces of our country. All of us, 
day after day, salute their courage and their dedication to the 
country, and it reminds us of our responsibility of making sure we are 
going to get the policy right in Iraq. More about that at another time.
