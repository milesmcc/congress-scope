Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, President Bush says he supports our 
troops, but his actions last week refute those claims, and his actions 
speak louder than his words.

Last Thursday, this House voted overwhelmingly, by 397-27, to support 
a defense authorization bill that gives our troops a much-deserved 3.5 
percent raise, a lot less than the contractors from Halliburton are 
getting, contractors that the President has farmed out much of the war 
in Iraq to, but still a 3.5 percent raise.



Incredibly, the President has threatened to veto the bill. Two of the 
reasons he gave for his opposition are the pay raise and benefits to 
survivors. By threatening to veto this bill, how exactly is our 
President supporting our troops? Well, he is not.

Over the last 5 years, the President has asked much of our military. 
Extended deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have strained our Active 
military and National Guard and their families. This Congress 
overwhelmingly said we should reward our troops. If the President 
really wants to support our troops, he will sign the bill.
