Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share the collective 
grief of the people of north Texas in the death of PVT Clarence T. 
Spencer, 24, who died defending our country in support of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom on February 4, 2007.

Mr. Clarence Spencer was assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 12th 
Cavalry Regiment, and 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas. While 
serving the U.S. Army, he put forth continuous dedication and bravery 
in protecting our Nation. His compassion and faithfulness in serving 
our country will forever be remembered, and his loss is greatly felt by 
all.

Mr. Spencer is survived by his wife in Killeen, Texas, and his mother 
and father in Fort Worth, Texas. I extend my sincerest condolences to 
his family and friends, and my thoughts and prayers are with them. Mr. 
Spencer's courage and dedication brought hope of a safer country. He 
will be remembered as a husband, a son, and a hero.
