Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add my voice to 
others who are calling for an end to the war in Iraq. We must end this 
war, and we must end it now. We cannot wait, and we must not wait.

Every month, every week, every hour, every minute, every second, 
every moment that another young American is killed, their innocent 
blood is on all of our hands. We have a moral obligation to bring this 
madness to an end. Nothing but nothing good can come out of this war. 
It is destroying Iraq and destroying the very soul of our Nation.

As Members of Congress, we must find a way to stop it and stop it 
now.
