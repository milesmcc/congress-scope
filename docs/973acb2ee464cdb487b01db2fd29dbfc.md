`Mr. SHAYS â€” 10 September 2007`

Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my chairman, now ranking member, 
yielding to me.

Mr. Speaker, 9/11 was a wake-up call from hell. We all know how we 
reacted to it, but the weeks that followed for those of us in the 
greater New York area had special meaning. It was a very poignant time.

I think of the family of Joe Coppo whose son, Joseph, said good-bye 
to him. And he talked about his dad and he said: Dad, you wanted me to 
become an adult. This is a young man now in college, and he told us of 
all of the things he said that his dad wanted him to learn. And then he 
said: Dad I have learned from you, and don't worry, I'll be there to 
take care of Mom.

Or the next week in the same church, Frank Fechet in talking about 
his son, Brad, and all of the things that he wanted him to learn and 
then he said: But, son, I learned far more from you than you ever 
learned from me.

Or going to a service in Easton, Connecticut, at a small old church. 
It was built hundreds of years ago. Everybody couldn't fit in. It was a 
beautiful, sunny day and they were talking about a father, mother, and 
a precious 3-year-old child. They talked about the father and the 
mother, and then they had the nursery school where this 3-year-old 
child went, they had the teachers come and talk about this young child 
in a very precious way and then had us sing one of her favorite songs. 
When I left, the parents wanted to see me; and they said this can't be 
about anger and hate. They were lecturing me about what it couldn't be, 
and I was thinking I needed to tell them how much we cared for them.

Or a family a week later, Neal and Jean Coleman, saying good-bye to 
two sons, Scott and Keith. It was a candlelight vigil and they talked 
about the sons. When it was over, the parents insisted on seeing me. 
They knew I was there. I tried to kind of just leave and not be too 
much of a presence. They said to me: this cannot be about anger and 
hate.

Well, it is not about anger and hate. But it is a wake-up call. There 
is more than one inconvenient truth that confronts us. There is the one 
that Al Gore talks about. We could probably think of others. But there 
is one that the 9/11 Commission talks about. The one that the 9/11 
Commission talks about is Islamic terrorists who would do us harm at 
home and abroad. That's a wake-up call. It is an inconvenient truth.

We are confronting these Islamic terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
in Europe, in Asia, in North and South


America. We are going to confront them, but it is a very inconvenient 
truth.

One thing that the 9/11 families asked us for is please pay attention 
to this. Detect, prevent, preempt. Don't let them attack us again. 
Those are things that require us to have powers like the PATRIOT Act, 
like a FISA law that works and isn't a meaningless law and one that 
prevents us from getting at these terrorists.

So there are a lot of lessons here that I think we can learn. I just 
would conclude by saying all of us are united in wanting to confront 
Islamic terrorists, but that means we need to be united in terms of 
what we do in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world about the FISA 
law. Just as we lecture the Iraqis about how they need to come 
together, we need to do a better job of coming together.
