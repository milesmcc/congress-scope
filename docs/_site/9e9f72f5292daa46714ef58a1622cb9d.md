Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. 
I can think of no two Senators on our side of the aisle whose words are 
listened to more carefully and more respectfully than the Senator from 
New Hampshire and the Senator from Utah. I salute the Senator from 
Pennsylvania for his statement and leadership, and the Senator from 
Arkansas, who spoke so constructively, and especially the Senator from 
Colorado, who is the principal sponsor of this legislation and whom I 
am proud to join.

Senator Pryor is exactly right when he said this morning that it is 
time for us to stop having partisan votes on Iraq. If I were an 
American fighting in Iraq, I would be looking back at us and wondering: 
What are they doing in Washington, DC, arguing and sniping at each 
other while we are fighting and dying? I would be thinking: If they are 
going to send us to Iraq to do a job, at least they could agree on what 
the job is.

We owe it to our troops and to our country to find a bipartisan 
consensus to support where we go from here in Iraq. We need a political 
solution in Washington, DC, as much as we need a political solution in 
Baghdad.

The announcements today by four more Senators, each well respected--
Senators Pryor, Bennett, Casey, Gregg--suggests the recommendations of 
the Iraq Study Group is the way to do that. Three Republicans, three 
Democrats from the North, South, East, and West, some relatively new 
Senators, some who have been here a long time, fresh voices, a fresh 
approach for a fresh attitude for this debate. Before the end of the 
week, I believe there will be two more Senators--one Democrat, one 
Republican. Then in June when we return to Washington, the six or the 
eight of us intend to offer the legislation Senator Salazar and I have 
drafted to implement the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study 
Group.

Today we are only six, perhaps eight--a modest beginning. But even we 
six or eight are a more promising bipartisan framework of support for a 
new direction in Iraq than we have seen for some time in the Senate. 
Those who know the Senate know we usually do our best and most 
constructive work when a handful of Senators cross party lines to take 
a fresh look at a problem, embrace a new strategy, and try to do what 
is right for our country.

We are not going to put hundreds of thousands of American troops into 
Iraq. We are not going to get out of Iraq tomorrow, and the current 
surge of troops in Baghdad, which we all hope is successful, is not by 
itself a strategy for tomorrow. The Iraq Study Group report is a 
strategy for tomorrow. It will get the United States out of the combat 
business in Iraq and into the support, equipment, and the training 
business in a prompt and honorable way. It will reduce the number of 
troops in Iraq. Those who stay will be less in harm's way--in more 
secure bases, embedded with Iraqi forces. Special forces will stay to 
counter al-Qaida. The report says this could--not must but could--
happen in early 2008, depending on circumstances.


The report allows support for General Petraeus and his troops by 
specifically authorizing a surge, such as the current surge. Because 
there would still be a significant long-term presence in Iraq, it will 
signal to the rest of the Middle East to stay out of Iraq.

It aggressively encourages diplomatic efforts. The President of the 
United States has spoken well of this report recently, and embraced 
parts of it, but it is not his plan. The Democratic majority has 
borrowed parts of the Iraq Study Group report, but it is not the 
Democratic majority plan. That is why the report has a chance to work. 
It has the seeds of a bipartisan consensus.

We six or eight, or hopefully more, will introduce our legislation in 
June, making the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group the policy of 
our country and inviting the President to submit a plan based upon 
those recommendations. I hope President Bush will embrace this 
strategy. I hope more Senators will.

It is ironic for the oldest democracy, the United States, to be 
lecturing the youngest democracy, Iraq, about coming up with a 
political consensus when we, ourselves, can't come up with one. This is 
the foremost issue facing our country. The Iraq Study Group report is 
the most promising strategy for a solution: getting out of the combat 
business in Iraq and into the support, equipping, and training business 
in a prompt and honorable way.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
