Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I do have a question, and it involves 
what I believe to be an utter failing by Congress on behalf of our 
Nation's military men and women. My question to my colleague from Texas 
is this. I know in Kansas we are at risk of losing $365 million in 
regard to BRAC construction. My question would be to the Senator 
whether the same thing is true in Texas.

I think, probably to put it in perspective, I need to get a little 
background information so the Senator could reply. That brings 
attention to why I am bringing a question to the distinguished Senator 
and why I wished to take the floor for 15 minutes. I hope we don't get 
into an objection. I certainly have no problem with Senator Kennedy 
speaking on any subject. I think he does that very well--and often.

Basically, let me say, with apologies to the Lizzie Borden family, 
that:




 The Democrat House took a continuing resolution axe,



 and gave the military 40 whacks,



 and when they saw what they had done,



 then they gave Kansas 41.


I don't think that is right. I am not here to speak about our 
military presence in Iraq. We have moved away from the debate on our 
presence in Iraq. We must now address the issue of support for our 
troops at home, and that is why I am going to ask the Senator a 
question, as soon as I give the background in regard to the question I 
have.


As we have heard some of my colleagues already state today, we are in 
danger of underfunding military construction associated with BRAC by 
over $3 billion--actually it is $3.1 billion. Should the Senate let 
this occur, we will have failed our Nation's soldiers and their 
families.

Why did this occur? Because there was $6 billion within the military 
budget, within the Department of Defense, who wanted $6 billion for 
BRAC construction. Is that not correct, I ask my distinguished friend?
