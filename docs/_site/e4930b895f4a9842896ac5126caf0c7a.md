`Mr. LAUTENBERG â€” 11 July 2007`

---


Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, more time has passed, and more 
American troops have lost their lives overseas. I feel very strongly 
that we should take a few moments in the U.S. Senate to honor them.

Outside my office here in Washington, we have a tribute called 
''Faces of the Fallen.'' Visitors to the Senate from across the country 
have stopped by the memorial. I encourage my colleagues to come see 
this tribute on the third floor of the Hart Building.

I last came to the Senate floor to honor our fallen troops at the end 
of May. And between that time and the end of June, the Pentagon 
announced the deaths of 165 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. I want them 
to be remembered. So today, I will insert their names into the Record:

Staff Sergeant Weiglein was killed after an IED, or ''improvised 
explosive device,'' blew up while he was on patrol. He was 31.

Sergeant Snell died after his unit came under fire from insurgents in 
Baghdad. He was 35.

Specialist Elazzouzi was killed by an IED, after it exploded outside 
his vehicle. He was 26.

Private First Class Bentz was also killed by an IED, after it 
exploded outside his vehicle. He was 20 years old.

And Sergeant Moretti died of injuries sustained in combat. She was

To date, more than 3,500 American men and women have lost their lives

will not forget them and the Nation will not forget their sacrifice.
