# RECOGNIZING DAY OF THE AFRICAN CHILD

`Ms. McCOLLUM â€” 31 July 2009`

---


Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 550, a 
resolution recognizing the Day of the African Child.

Each year more than half a million women die in pregnancy and 9 
million children die of preventable causes, half of whom are in Africa. 
This resolution recognizes the need to reduce maternal, newborn, and 
child deaths in


Africa, and recognizes the Day of the African Child which is held 
yearly on June 16th, and the importance of the U.S. partnership with 
African Leaders.

At this moment millions of boys and girls across the continent of 
Africa are struggling to survive. In Sub-Saharan Africa roughly 1 in 
every 7 children fail to reach their fifth birthday--the highest rate 
of under-five mortality in the world--and 9 out of 10 African mothers 
will lose a child during their lifetime.

But the picture in Africa is not hopeless. Eritrea, Ethiopia, Malawi 
and Mozambique, for example, have made significant progress in child 
survival and have reduced their under-five mortality rates by 40 
percent or more since 1990. The African Union has made child survival a 
theme for their 15th Ordinary Session in 2010 and the G8 Summit leaders 
have also made a commitment to ensure all children have access to free 
basic healthcare by 2015.

On June 16, 2009 I held a briefing with the Global Health Caucus and 
the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health to commemorate the Day of 
the African Child to explore the challenges remaining and actions to 
improve the well being of Africa's children. I was pleased to co-host 
this event Congressman Payne, the African Union, and several other 
organizations.

I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to make children and 
mothers in Africa and the developing world a priority.

Madam Speaker, on July 14, 2009 I had the opportunity to speak at the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) to discuss the 
development of a comprehensive strategy for improving the health of 
newborns, children, and mothers in the developing world. I would like 
to enter my remarks from this event into the Congressional Record.




Advancing Maternal and Child Health in the Developing World




 Good morning. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to be 


 asked by CSIS to speak about global health and specifically 


 the health needs of women and children in the world's poorest 


 countries.



 Let me start by thanking and congratulating CSIS and Steve 


 Morrison for the on-going commitment to elevate the 


 importance of global health. The work here is essential to 


 the examination of U.S. foreign policy and the health 


 investments our country is making around the world. CSIS's 


 global health effort is impressive and really important.



 Many of you are here today because you are working to 


 improve basic health care for women and children across the 


 developing world. Thank you for all that you do. Your work 


 may be to prevent needless deaths or to create opportunities 


 for tens of millions to achieve a basic quality of life in 


 which extreme poverty, hunger, disease, and suffering are 


 defeated. It is all important work and we need you to keep 


 fighting.



 Let me open my remarks with a single sentence from last 


 week's G8 Global Health Experts Report: ''Women and children 


 are among the most vulnerable groups and progress toward the 


 MDGs related to maternal, newborn and child health remains 


 too slow.''



 Let me repeat that last part again . . . ''progress toward 


 the MDGs related to maternal, newborn and child health 


 remains too slow.''



 Let me rephrase that in another way, 25,000 newborns and 


 children under-five died yesterday, are dying today, and will 


 die tomorrow--and everyday for the foreseeable future. One 


 thousand-five hundred mothers will die during pregnancy or 


 after delivery today, tomorrow, and everyday for the 


 foreseeable future.



 Is progress to end needless, preventable deaths progressing 


 too slowly?



 Of course it is. We don't need a G8 global health report to 


 tell us this.



 What the G8 should do is ask the mother and father of one 


 of the more than nine million children who died last year if 


 progress has been too slow. Or, they could ask the orphaned 


 children whose mother was one of the more than half million 


 women who die every year from a pregnancy related death.



 So what are we--the richest nation and the other donor 


 nations--doing to significantly reducing child and maternal 


 mortality while investing in building sustainable health 


 systems?



 Unfortunately, not enough in my opinion.



 Taking on the challenge of achieving MDG 4 to reduce 


 children mortality (by two-thirds) and MGD 5 to reduce 


 maternal mortality (by three-quarters) is a goal that could 


 be accomplished if the world community invests and acts.



 The goals are doable. But the fate of millions of women and 


 children cannot be just a talking point in a speech or a 


 summit declaration. We need to do more than just talk about 


 the MDGs.



 With regard to maternal and child health inspiring action 


 may be our biggest challenge. Ministries of Health in Sub-


 Saharan Africa and South Asia understand that women and 


 children are dying in massive numbers in their countries. The 


 development and global health community understand the 


 problem. Everyone in this room understands the situation.



 We don't need to wait for a miracle drug or a great 


 technological breakthrough to deliver an essential package of 


 interventions that can save the lives of millions of children 


 and hundred of thousands of women every year. We are 


 delivering those interventions today. And it is being done 


 all around the world right now, but it does need to be scaled 


 up and sustained.



 We know skilled birth attendants are needed at all births 


 and we know how to recruit and train them.



 We know expanding access to family planning and child 


 spacing improves the health of women and their children.



 We know exclusive breast feeding, immunizations for 


 measles, Vitamin A, and bed nets have combined to save 


 millions of lives over the past decade.



 We know the work of GAVI, the Global Fund, UNICEF and UNFPA 


 are saving lives.



 And, we know USAID has been making major contributions to 


 maternal and child health, as well as reproductive health, 


 for decades. Tens of millions of people are alive today 


 because of the child health programs implemented by USAID and 


 paid for by the American people over the past forty years. We 


 need to celebrate this tremendous success.



 All of you here today know every imaginable statistic and 


 fact about the lack of maternal and child health care, the 


 medical consequences, and the human cost. A lack of data is 


 not the problem.



 So let's look at maternal and child health from a different 


 perspective. What don't we know?



 This is a harder question.



 Something must be missing if we know how to solve such a 


 serious problem, save lives, and yet, children and moms are 


 still dying needlessly.



 Let me throw out a few questions for you to think about, 


 because I am looking for answers myself.



 Where is the urgency to save the lives of children and 


 mothers?



 Where is the political will to invest in the lives of 


 children and mothers?



 And does anybody know or care to know the names or the 


 faces of those babies and women who are dying needlessly at 


 this very moment?



 These are the questions we need to answer if we are going 


 to translate the endless reports, policy papers and strategic 


 plans into the advocacy, inspiration, investments, and action 


 needed to save lives.



 I am looking for answers and I am looking to you to help 


 find them.



 I am one voice and vote in the House of Representatives--


 there are 434 other voices and votes as well. Is child or 


 maternal survival a priority issue for Congress? We know it's 


 not but can it be much more of a priority?



 Imagine the possibility of a terrorist attack in which 5 


 million children were at risk, but we knew how to prevent the 


 attack and we knew it would cost $5 billion to save those 


 lives. Would Congress spend the money? Of course we would--


 even the Blue Dogs would vote for it.



 Unfortunately, the terror that strikes millions of parents 


 who watch their children die from malnutrition or malaria is 


 not the same terror that inspires Congress. The real sense of 


 urgency may need to start beyond Washington, in the very 


 countries in which women and children are dying at 


 unacceptable rates.



 For example, India and Pakistan have billions of dollars to 


 spend on advanced military hardware including nuclear 


 arsenals and yet tens of millions of their citizens live in 


 abject misery and die for no reason other than they are poor.



 Nigeria, a petroleum exporter, leads the African continent 


 in the number of mothers and children dying each year. This 


 should be a source of shame for such an African power.



 Where is the urgency in India, Pakistan, or Nigeria to 


 invest in their own citizens' lives? And, if they aren't 


 willing to make their own children's lives a priority, how do 


 I convince my constituents to make their kids a priority?



 Clearly the lack of urgency from the very countries where 


 women and children are dying translates directly into a lack 


 of political will.



 Since the whispers of dying moms and children are not heard 


 by politicians in Ethiopia, Zambia, Afghanistan, or the 


 United States, there should be no expectation that preventing 


 these deaths will be a political priority any time soon.



 For example, where is the urgency among nations of Sub-


 Saharan Africa to lobby Congress to save the lives of their 


 own citizens? If Africa's presidents are not prioritizing 


 maternal child health their ambassadors in Washington will 


 not be knocking on Congress's door asking for increased 


 appropriations.



 No urgency translates into a lack of political will which 


 in turn means limited resources and more needless deaths--a 


 self-perpetuating cycle.



 How will the NGO, think tank, and advocacy community help 


 to break this cycle? I want to hear your ideas.



 Here at home, is there the political will for the U.S. to 


 be the global champion for women and children?



 The Obama Administration has demonstrated the ability to 


 understand and articulate a global health vision. There have 


 been numerous positive statements regarding maternal child 


 health.



 The Administration's leadership would be essential for any 


 major increase in investments for maternal child health in
