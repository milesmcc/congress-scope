Mr. MILLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I too rise in support of the defense authorization act for 2011 as it 
was passed out of the full committee. I do think we have taken some 
important steps on protecting those who work


every day to protect the people and protect those of us in the United 
States.

The language that we had inserted into this bill, one of the things 
that it does is require the Department of Defense Inspector General to 
investigate the alleged misconduct and practices of certain lawyers for 
terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay.

Unanimously, the committee approved this amendment, whereby we have 
said that these lawyers may very well have engaged in illegal actions 
by seeking to ''out'' covert agents to the very terrorists that these 
particular agents took off the battlefield.

If this indeed is true, I can't think of a more offensive, 
unpatriotic and terrible act to be committed by the Americans that did 
this against fellow Americans.

I also do stand with the ranking member in opposition to the repeal 
of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. I agree, we also need to allow the Department 
of Defense to complete its study before we jump the gun to a rash, 
premature decision, one that diverts our military's attention from its 
true priorities. Those priorities are succeeding in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and also in keeping terrorists from harming Americans and 
its citizens.

Unfortunately, if the Murphy amendment does pass and we do repeal 
Don't Ask, Don't Tell, I will have to vote against H.R. 5136. But I 
trust this body will reject the Murphy amendment and allow our forces 
to remain focused on the task at hand--defending America.
