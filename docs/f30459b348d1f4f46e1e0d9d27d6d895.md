`Mr. WEBB â€” 19 September 2007`

Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes and clarify, 
from my perspective, the intention of this amendment in the context of 
a number of the things the Senator from South Carolina spoke about. 
That was quite a lengthy speech. There was a lot of material in it.

This amendment is a very narrow amendment. It is talking about a 
minimal adjustment in terms of troop rotation ratios. That is all this 
amendment is doing.

When the Senator from South Carolina mentioned we should not have the 
politics of the next election being the driving force in these sorts of 
situations, I hasten to clarify that my election occurred last year. It 
is going to be a while before that decision is faced again. The 
principal cosponsor on the Republican side, Senator Hagel, has 
indicated he is retiring from the Senate. These issues we are 
attempting to put before the Senate have nothing to do with the 
politics of being reelected.

Another point that I think needs to be made is that no one I know of 
is trying to push a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. The Senator from 
South Carolina made a lot of comments about if you want to end the war, 
if you believe it is the worst strategic error we have ever made, we 
should call for cutting off the funding. There are a lot of us, 
including myself, who believe this was a huge strategic blunder and 
said so before we went in. As I said to General Petraeus when he was 
testifying: That was then, this is now.

We have to find a way out of Iraq, for those of us who want to remove 
our residual forces eventually. That doesn't include everybody in this 
body. For those of us who want to remove all residual forces 
eventually, we have to do so in a way that will not further increase 
the instability in the region and will allow us to focus on 
international terrorism and our other strategic interests around the 
world. There is no debate on that. That is not what this amendment is 
about. We must do that through a proper, regionally based diplomatic 
solution. That will only take place with the right sort of leadership 
out of the administration. But that is not on the table. That is not 
what we are trying to address in this amendment.


There have been questions on the constitutional issues. Again, I go 
to article I, section 8. The Congress has the power ''To make Rules for 
the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces. . . .''

There has been some discussion about how this should not apply to 
movement of forces during a time of war. I don't see this as a movement 
of forces in a time of war, and I do see precedent, again, from the 
Korean war. This is a very similar situation; it is on the other end of 
it.

In the Korean war, an administration was sending our troops into 
combat before they had been properly trained.


The administration would say that is proper. The Secretary of Defense 
would come in and say that is proper, we need these troops in Korea. 
But the Congress decided it was not proper, that once our people step 
forward and take the oath of enlistment or oath of office, there is 
some protection that should come if there is a belief from the Congress 
that the executive branch has not used them properly.

This is an intrinsically limited power. It is limited by the nature 
of this process. All one has to do is take a look at the votes we need 
today to move it forward. But it is a power that belongs in the 
Congress when the right vote is taken.

Senator McCain and Senator Graham had a lengthy colloquy about 
service. Believe me, I am indebted to both of them and to the others 
who have served our country for the service they have given. Thirty 
years ago this year, I started as a committee counsel in the Congress. 
I was the first Vietnam veteran to work as a full committee counsel. At 
that time, two-thirds of the Members in the Congress had served in the 
military. That number is a very small percentage today. So it affects, 
in some cases, the ability of people to understand the movements on the 
ground, but it also increases the importance of people such as Senator 
McCain and Senator Graham, both of whom I respectfully disagree with on 
this particular amendment, but it increases the importance of what they 
are saying and the insight they are bringing. I greatly respect both of 
them for their service.

I know there is going to be a sense of the Senate submitted after our 
vote is taken--I assume after our vote is taken. I wish to say again 
this is basically a figleaf. This is not a time for the Congress to be 
giving advice. It is a time for the Congress to step in and put a floor 
under those people who are serving us.

This is a very minimal adjustment, but it is, in my view and in the 
view of others, an essential adjustment in terms of how we are handling 
the welfare and well-being of people who are going again and again.

On that point, I again remind the Senate that for the first time in 
all the years we have been involved in Iraq, we are seeing people from 
the administration and from the other party openly saying they expect 
we might be in Iraq for the next 50 years. I was warning 5 years ago 
this month, in an editorial in the Washington Post, that there was no 
exit strategy from the people who wanted us to go into Iraq because 
they didn't intend to leave. Now we are seeing graphic evidence of 
that. That is a debate we are going to have. That is a debate we are 
going to have separate from this amendment. The only purpose of this 
amendment is to provide some stability in the rotational cycles, 
particularly of our traditional ground forces in the Army and Marine 
Corps, so we can have that debate in a way that calms down the 
instability in the forces.

I yield the floor.
