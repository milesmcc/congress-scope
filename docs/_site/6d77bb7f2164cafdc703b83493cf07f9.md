Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about 
some important legislation that honors the sacrifice and courage of our 
women who have served and are currently serving in our armed forces.

The Veteran's legislation we considered today provides an opportunity 
for each of us, regardless of political views, religion, ethnicity, 
gender, or background to come together, and to recognize and honor our 
Nation's heroes.

We gather here today, in the midst of ongoing conflict and warfare, 
to celebrate the dedication of our men and women in uniform. Though we 
may be divided by our positions on the war in Iraq, we stand together 
to support our veterans. Our Nation has a proud legacy of appreciation 
and commitment to the men and women who have worn the uniform in 
defense of this country. We must be united in seeing that every 
soldier, sailor, airman, and marine is welcomed back with all the care 
and compassion this grateful Nation can bestow.

All too many of our veterans are left without the help and support 
they need to transition from the horrors they bravely face on the front 
lines of battle to successful civilian life. According to the Veterans 
Affairs Department, as of 2006, on any given night, 196,000 veterans of 
all ages were homeless.

The V.A. also reports 400 veterans of the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan alone have already become homeless, and this figure only 
takes into account those who have sought services from V.A.-sponsored 
programs. Experts have predicted that the trauma resulting from the 
extreme horrors of these modern wars could lead to a surge in homeless 
veterans in the coming years.

I chose to celebrate one of our heroic daughters of Texas, Specialist 
Monica L. Brown of the United States Army with House Concurrent 
Resolution 320 for her efforts earlier this year.

Spec. Brown was the first woman in Afghanistan and only the second 
female soldier since World War II to receive the Silver Star, the 
Nation's third-highest medal for valor. This solider from Lake Jackson, 
Texas is only 19 years old.

On April 25, 2007, Specialist Brown was part of a four-vehicle convoy 
patrolling near


Jani Kheil in the eastern province of Paktia on April 25, 2007, when a 
bomb struck one of the Humvees.

When Spec. Brown saw her fellow soldiers were injured, she grabbed 
her aid bag and started running toward the burning vehicle as 
insurgents opened fire. All five wounded soldiers from her platoon 
scrambled out. Under this commotion, she assessed her patients and 
moved them to a safer location because they were still receiving 
incoming fire.

The Pentagon's official policy is to prohibit women from serving in 
front-line combat roles in the infantry, armor or artillery, but 
the nature of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with no real front 
lines, has seen women soldiers take part in close-quarters combat more 
than previous conflicts.


According to the army four Army nurses in World War II were the first 
women to receive the Silver Star, though three nurses serving in World 
War I were awarded the medal posthumously in 2007. Sgt. Leigh Ann 
Hester, of Nashville, Tenn., was the first to receive the Silver Star 
in 2005 along with two fellow male soldiers for her gallantry during an 
insurgent ambush on a convoy in Iraq.

The Army has stated that Spec. Brown's ''bravery, unselfish actions 
and medical aid rendered under fire saved the lives of her comrades and 
represents the finest traditions of heroism in combat.''

Though I have opposed the war in Iraq from its inception, I remain 
absolutely committed to ensuring that we recognize, celebrate, and 
honor the service of our sons and daughters returning from Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Our troops in Iraq did everything we asked them to do, and 
I firmly believe that we must commend the men and women of our military 
for their exemplary performance and success in Iraq.

I am proud to be a cosponsor on H. Res. 1054--Honoring the service 
and achievements of women in the Armed Forces and female veterans 
(Representative Davis (CA)--Armed Services) and H.R. 3819--Veterans 
Emergency Care Fairness Act of 2007 (Representative Space--Veterans' 
Affairs).

We are providing for our Veterans with legislation such as:

H.R. 6081--The Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 
(Representative Rangel--Ways and Means).

H. Res. 986--Recognizing the courage and sacrifice of those members 
of the United States Armed Forces who were held as prisoners of war 
during the Vietnam conflict and calling for a full accounting of the 
1,729 members of the Armed Forces who remain unaccounted for from the 
Vietnam conflict (Representative Boehner--Armed Services)--Recorded 
Vote

H.R. 2790--To establish the position of Director of Physician 
Assistant Services within the office of the Under Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs for Health as amended (Representative Hare--Veterans' Affairs).

H.R. 3681--Veterans Benefits Awareness Act of 2007 (Representative 
Boozman--Veterans' Affairs).

H.R. 3889--To require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a 
longitudinal study of the vocational rehabilitation programs 
administered by the Secretary (Representative Boozman--Veterans' 
Affairs)--Passed

H.R. 5554--Veterans Substance Use Disorders Prevention and Treatment 
Act of 2008 (Representative Michaud--Veterans' Affairs)--Passed

H.R. 5664--To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to update at 
least once every six years the plans and specifications for specially 
adapted housing furnished to veterans by the Secretary (Representative 
Rodriguez--Veterans' Affairs).

H.R. 5826--Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 
2008 (Representative Rodriguez--Veterans' Affairs)--Recorded Vote

H.R. 5856--Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Facility 
Authorization and Lease Act of 2008 (Representative Michaud--Veterans' 
Affairs).

H.R. 6048--To amend the Service members Civil Relief Act to provide 
for the protection of child custody arrangements for parents who are 
members of the Armed Forces deployed in support of a contingency 
operation (Representative Turner--Veterans' Affairs).

I firmly believe that we should celebrate our veterans after every 
conflict, and I remain committed, as a Member of Congress, to both 
meeting the needs of veterans of previous wars, and to provide a 
fitting welcome home to those who are now serving. Veterans have kept 
their promise to serve our Nation; they have willingly risked their 
lives to protect the country we all love. We must now ensure that we 
keep our promises to our veterans.

Currently, there are over 25 million veterans in the United States. 
There are more than 1,633,000 veterans living in Texas and more than 
32,000 veterans living in my congressional district alone. I hope we 
will all take the time to show appreciation to those who have answered 
the call to duty. As Winston Churchill famously stated, ''Never in the 
field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.''

Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting our 
troops of yesteryear and our troops of today.
