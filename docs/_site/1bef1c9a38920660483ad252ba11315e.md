`Mr. SPECTER â€” 10 September 2007`

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am cosponsoring the amendment offered 
by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota because I believe there 
are very serious safety issues involved here which have not been 
answered sufficiently by the Department of Transportation.

Here we have a situation where the Secretary of Transportation 
announced a pilot program on February 23 of this year to allow up to 
100 Mexican trucking companies to ship goods to and from the United 
States. The Iraq supplemental appropriations bill delayed 
implementation of this program until there was a report by the 
inspector general and a response by the Department of Transportation. 
The inspector general released his report and the Department of 
Transportation submitted responses on the same day--on September 6. As 
I read these documents, it is insufficient to have the requisite 
guarantees of safety. And of no little concern to me is that all of 
this should be done on the same day, without taking into account some 
very serious underlying problems.

There are safety concerns here which include the database 
deficiencies that prevent the Department of Transportation inspectors 
from being able to accurately gather information on truckdriver 
convictions and driving violations, vehicle accident reports, and 
insurance records. The inspector general confirms that these databases 
are still under development. The Department of Transportation report 
does not respond to these issues.

The inspector general report also states that the Department of 
Transportation has not developed and implemented adequate plans for 
checking trucks and drivers participating in the demonstration project 
as they cross the border. The DOT report responded by stating they 
created border-crossing plans with the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection. Well, that is hardly an assurance of safety.

We do want to have good relations with Mexico. We do not want to 
impede legitimate commerce. But safety is a very vital factor, and 
there are good reasons to insist on safety and verification before we 
permit this pilot program with 100 trucking companies, which we can 
obviously expect to be supplemented in a very substantial number. When 
you are dealing with issues on truckdriver convictions and driving 
violations and vehicle accident reports, you are talking about 
something which is very probative on whether it is a safe program. When 
you are talking about insurance records, those are necessary in order 
to be sure that if there are accidents, and there is liability, there 
is adequate insurance to protect Americans from these trucks which are 
coming into our country.

We have had a fair amount of experience here. I believe there is 
ample time to reevaluate this program if and when this database is 
updated and there is sufficient record documentation to guarantee the 
requisite safety. But on this date of the record, it seems to me this 
program ought not to go forward, and the amendment which Senator Dorgan 
has advanced is very sound. I


intend to support it and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for yielding me 
time at this stage of the debate.
