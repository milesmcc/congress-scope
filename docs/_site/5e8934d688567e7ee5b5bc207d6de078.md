`Mr. WESTMORELAND â€” 28 June 2007`

Mr. WESTMORELAND. I just want to tell Mr. Chairman that I hope Mr. 
Price is listening because it is going to take a lot of truth squad to 
straighten this out.

The chairman over here mentioned the Iraq spending and wanted to see 
how much we would cut it. Well, when the President sent down the 
emergency Iraq spending bill the Democrats went ''Yee-Haw,'' let's add 
$23 billion to it.

So I want to quote what the chairman and the subcommittee chairman 
has said. ''Don't lecture me on spending on the war.''
