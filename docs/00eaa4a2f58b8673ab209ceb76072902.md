Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to thank my good friend and colleague, 
Congressman Carol Shea-Porter, for working with me on this amendment. 
Before I speak about this important amendment, I'd like to thank all of 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their great expression of 
support for me and my family over the last several days. It means so 
much to me and to my family that all of you have kept us in your 
prayers.

I'd like to say on behalf of this amendment my gratitude to the 
chairman and to the ranking member for their support for our troops, 
our Guard and Reserve, who are carrying the brunt of this battle in 
Afghanistan and in Iraq, and for whom we are just trying to extend this 
24-hour suicide hotline so as to provide them the same extensive care 
and outreach that we have now provided those others of our veterans who 
now have benefited from such a hotline in our VA.

I think this is an appropriate addition to this DOD bill, and I am 
glad to see that it's adopted in this bill. I thank the chairman for 
including it in this bill.
