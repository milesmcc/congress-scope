Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the Congress is at a low point in terms of 
its ratings with the American public, but I want the American public to 
know that I am proud to be a Member of this Congress. Congress is part 
of a system of government that involves the executive and a two-part 
legislature that includes the Senate and the House. Our system of 
government is the best ever known to man, and it's working; although 
slowly, it's working.

The country has told the Congress and the President what the American 
people want, and that is to bring our troops home from Iraq, or to 
redeploy them to fight al Qaeda in Afghanistan and other places where 
there is terrorism.

We have increased the minimum wage. We have put more money into Pell 
Grants. We have reduced the cost of college loans. We are going to try 
to pass a bill, which I think we will today, on stem cell research to 
give people with catastrophic illnesses hope for the future.

This Congress is doing things to make America better. We are doing it 
in a responsible way with a balanced budget.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a Member of this Congress, and I want 
this country to know that this Congress is working hard and doing its 
job to put America on the right course. We are draining the swamp to 
make this a more ethical place.
