Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life 
and the memory of PFC Katie Soenksen, who graduated from Davenport 
North High School in 2005 and died in an explosion on May 2 in West 
Baghdad, Iraq, while conducting a security mission in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom.

Katie was a 19-year-old woman from Davenport, Iowa, who was a member 
of the 410th Military Police Company from Fort Hood, Texas. She left 
behind a loving family, including her parents, Ron and Mary Ann 
Soenksen, a brother, Matthew, from Davenport, and a sister, Sarah, from 
Blue Springs, Missouri.

Katie's friends and family remember her as a fun-loving, energetic 
young woman who loved bowling, playing softball and spending time with 
her friends.

Mr. Speaker, as we come to the floor every day and decide important 
public policy issues that affect the lives of people like Katie 
Soenksen, I hope we all remember that this is something we are all in 
together, and the lives of future generations of Americans are affected 
by the policies that we set on this floor.
