`Mr. LATTA â€” 7 December 2009`

---


Mr. LATTA. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, it is very appropriate that we assemble here today on 
December 7, ''a day that will live in infamy,'' words that were spoken 
by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on this House floor 68 years ago 
tomorrow. On that December 7, the United States lost many courageous, 
dedicated, heroic, compassionate men and women when the Pacific fleet 
was attacked at Pearl Harbor by forces of the Imperial Japan Navy.

I rise today in support of House Resolution 940, which I introduced 
last week on December 1.

As it has already been pointed out very eloquently about the 
background of the National Guard, the Guard dates its origins back to 
December 13, 1636, when the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony ordered existing militias to be organized into three regiments. 
Since then, the National Guard has fought in every major American 
conflict. From the shot that was heard around the world at Lexington 
Green and later at Concord Bridge in April of 1775 to our men and women 
who are standing strong today and fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, the 
National Guard and its citizen soldiers have been there for us no 
matter what, always ready, always there.

The National Guard is the oldest component of the Armed Forces of the 
United States. The National Guard's number one priority is the security 
and defense of our homeland at home and abroad. Americans have relied 
on their National Guard for more than three-and-a-half centuries, even 
before the United States existed.

I want to thank all past and present members of the National Guard 
for their service and response to the attacks on September 11, 2001, 
and their continuing role in homeland security and military operations 
around the world.

In today's world, it is essential that we honor and support all of 
our servicemembers who have sacrificed so much for us to ensure that 
our freedoms and liberties are secure in the United States. We need to 
support and provide our men and women of the National Guard and all the 
Armed Forces with the necessary resources to ensure their readiness and 
success.

As the National Guard's official song goes, ''Defending freedom, 
protecting dreams, this is the spirit of what it means to me. For my 
God and my home that I love: I Guard America, Guarding America, 
America.''
