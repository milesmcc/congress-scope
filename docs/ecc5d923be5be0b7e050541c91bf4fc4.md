`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 24 January 2007`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know how difficult of a decision this 
is for Senator Kerry to make. And today, I say to the people of the 
country how proud all of us in Massachusetts are of John Kerry, and his 
outstanding service in the United States Senate for our State and for 
our country. Throughout his career, he has been a true hero in every 
sense of the word.

He has been my colleague since 1984, and I have deeply valued the 
opportunity to work side-by-side with him, but most of all I'm proud to 
call him my friend. Over the years, Vicki and I have grown so close to 
John and his wonderful wife Teresa and his loving daughters Vanessa and 
Alexandra. They are a special family, and their friendship is one we 
cherish.

We heard just a few moments ago why he was able to galvanize the 
country, and earn such tremendous support, in the 2004 Presidential 
campaign. The eloquence, the passion, the insight, the knowledge of 
history, and awareness of public events--these qualities we saw on 
display just moments ago in this Chamber--these are the qualities that 
characterize and define the career of John Kerry.

Now John has decided to continue to devote his passion, his interest, 
and his energies toward bringing our troops home from Iraq safely, and 
how fortunate they are to know that he will devote all of his energies 
to that cause over the next months--hopefully not years. All of us in 
Massachusetts look forward to his continued service in the United 
States Senate for years to come and to his voice and his vote working 
here for the working people of Massachusetts, for their jobs, for their 
health care, for the education of their children, for the betterment of 
their environment, and for their hope for a better quality of life. 
He's been there for us in the past on so many of these critical 
concerns, and we take comfort in knowing he'll be there for all of us 
in the future as well.

I know this has been a difficult time for John. I congratulate him on 
an outstanding presentation this afternoon, and for his courage and 
determination. I congratulate him for continuing to want to make a very 
important difference on the overarching and overriding issue of our 
time, and that is how we can remedy this catastrophic mistake of Iraq 
and bring our servicemen home safely.

I'm grateful to be able to call John Kerry my colleague and friend, 
and look forward to working with him for years to come.
