Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1/1/2/ minutes.

Mr. Speaker, we have heard significant discussion tonight about al 
Qaeda. And people seem to think that Iraq, the Iraq war was necessary 
in order to tackle al Qaeda. Well, that's backwards.

I can recall being out at CIA headquarters after 9/11. I can recall 
sitting out at CIA headquarters watching the Predator aircraft as they 
flew over Afghanistan, transmitting pictures back here in the search 
for bin Laden and al Qaeda. And I remember what those CIA people out 
there said, and the frustration they expressed because half of their 
resources were being diverted from the search for bin Laden and al 
Qaeda to prepare for the attack on Iraq.

It isn't that the war in Iraq was necessary to get at al Qaeda. The 
war in Iraq diverted us from concentrating on al Qaeda and bin Laden.



And we are still suffering the consequences today.

So let's keep the facts straight. Let's keep history straight. And 
let's keep our heads straight. The fact is that Iraq got in the way of 
our effort to get at al Qaeda and we have been suffering from that fact 
ever since.
