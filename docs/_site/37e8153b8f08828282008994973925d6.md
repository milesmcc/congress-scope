# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `37e8153b8f08828282008994973925d6`
`Mr. SMITH of Washington â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I would just first observe 
that none of these soldiers who died in Iraq, no matter what happens 
from this point forward, died in vain. No soldier who dies fighting for 
his country and his comrades dies in vain, regardless of the politics. 
I hope we would all understand that.

Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. Maloney).
