Mr. HUNTER. Taking my time back, I would just say to the gentleman, I 
put my initiatives, and I don't call them earmarks because I don't 
think they are illegitimate, I put them on the Internet. As I learned 
in my ill-fated national campaign, people aren't paying a lot of 
attention to my Internet site. But I had it there for millions of 
people to see. And I think that is the appropriate thing to do.

I just want to assure the gentleman of something so that he rests 
easy, to some degree. The people of this committee are really 
hardworking people. I think we have got one member who's been to 
Afghanistan and Iraq something like 13 times. I haven't been there that 
much, but I have been there a lot. They spend a ton of time working for 
the uniformed people of the United States. They make lots of notes and 
they do lots of analysis.

Let me tell you, the way you put together a defense budget is you 
have got somebody sitting in the Pentagon, and somebody comes over and 
sits next to him and says, You know, here's a system that the company I 
am working for would like to have in the defense budget. And they make 
a case for it.

None of this stuff is derived through a stainless process. We are all 
people. The only thing that really makes this government go is 
accountability, and people should be held accountable for the things 
that they put in the bill. The vast number of folks that put things in 
the defense bill put out press releases with respect to what they put 
in. They don't hide that. People put in provisions that have a value to 
the military. If you go down the line and analyze them, I think that 
you would concur with that.

So I want you to know this is a committee that really does its 
homework. It's got a great staff that works very hard, and we have done 
a lot of things that have saved soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines on 
the battlefield, who


would not have been saved if we just rubber-stamped the President's 
budget. I guess that is my point.

I thank the gentleman.

I withdraw my reservation.
