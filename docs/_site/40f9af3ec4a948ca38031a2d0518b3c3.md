`Mr. DOGGETT â€” 12 July 2007`

Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, we were reassured that ''progress'' was 
being made in Iraq 500 deaths ago, 1,000 deaths ago, 2,000 deaths ago, 
and 3,000 deaths ago.

Like the boy who cried wolf, this President cries ''progress.'' What 
progress?

With all this talk about benchmarks, I think it's time to get off the 
bench and bring our troops home now, with an immediate, responsible, 
and safe redeployment.

President Bush says as we approach five years of being in Iraq, he 
says ''listen to the generals.''

Well, we've listened to them, and his top general says if we followed 
his course, if we stay his course, we'll be in Iraq fighting for 
another five to ten years.

Real progress would begin by adopting today's very modest proposal 
and moving forward united so that our troops are not caught up in a 
final disastrous position in Iraq, and that we responsibly redeploy to 
protect our families, rather than generating one generation after 
another of jihadists.
