Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I represent Guam, a small little island in the Pacific 
where we have today more active National Guardsmen reservists serving 
in Afghanistan and Iraq per capita than any other State in the Union.

Just last month I led a codel to Pakistan, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and 
Iraq and found 181 National Guardsmen and reservists from Guam deployed 
in Afghanistan serving in the most dangerous provinces in that country.

I want to speak to this bill because on Guam, because of the numerous 
soldiers deployed all over the world today, the support group is 
exceptional, made up of family and friends. I have visited their 
headquarters, and it's made up of housewives, families, and friends all 
supporting our soldiers. And I want to go on record to say that I 
applaud our soldiers and families on Guam for their dedicated support 
and loyalty, and I go on record as supporting this bill.

Mr. Speaker, at this time I have no further requests for time, and I 
am prepared to close after my colleague has yielded back his time.

I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
