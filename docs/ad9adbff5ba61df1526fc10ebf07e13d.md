Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, on September 16th, 
General Ray Odierno took command of Multi-National Force--Iraq. His 
predecessor, General David Petraeus will soon assume the role of 
Combatant Commander of the United States Central Command.

By any measure of success, General Petraeus' leadership of allied 
forces in Iraq has been extraordinary. Under his command and the surge 
of U.S. forces last year, the Iraqi military, its civilian leadership, 
and its economy have begun to turn around. Violence is down. Relative 
order has been restored to cities and towns across Iraq. And Al Qaeda 
has been dealt tremendous psychological and military setbacks.

The recent handover of Al Anbar Province to Iraqi control and the 
announcement from President George W. Bush that American troop levels 
in Iraq could be reduced in the beginning of next year are signs that 
our strategy is working. However, there is a difficult road ahead for 
the Iraqi people. I am grateful that General Odierno will be leading 
our forces and helping this young democracy overcome external and 
internal threats. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines under his 
command and American families all around this Nation can be confident 
of General Odierno's proven record of steady and sound leadership.

Iraq is a different country today than it was just a little over a 
year ago. This is due to an Iraqi people who are fed up with the 
hopeless terrorism of militant extremists and have stood up against it. 
And, just as importantly, it is due to the incredible sacrifice of our 
troops under the command of General Petraeus. I know his wisdom and 
strength will serve him well and our Nation well as he assumes the 
command of CENTCOM.

The sacrifice of our troops on the ground in Iraq has been 
tremendous. The loss of life in the pursuit of a stable and secure Iraq 
has been difficult to bear for this Nation and, in particular, our 
military families. Americans should be eternally grateful for our brave 
troops and their families and for the freedoms and blessings they 
protect and defend. The best plan to protect American families and 
Iraqi families is to defeat terrorism overseas at the source.
