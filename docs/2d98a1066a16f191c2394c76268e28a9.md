`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 23 January 2008`

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on January 3, 2008, MAJ Andrew Olmsted of 
Northborough, MA, was killed in Iraq. He was the first American 
servicemember to die in Iraq this year. During his service there, he 
wrote a number of essays about his service that he posted on the 
Internet. His final essay, written in anticipation of his possible 
death, is an eloquent farewell that I believe will be of interest to 
all of us in Congress, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed 
in the Record.
