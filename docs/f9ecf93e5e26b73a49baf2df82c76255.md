# EXECUTIVE SESSION F_____
## `f9ecf93e5e26b73a49baf2df82c76255`
`Mr. LEAHY â€” 4 August 2010`

---


Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on that subject, I would like to note a 
letter of support the Judiciary Committee received from 1LT David 
Tressler. He was at Harvard Law School when Solicitor General Kagan 
served there as dean. He is currently serving in harm's way in 
Afghanistan, and he strongly supports Solicitor General Kagan for this 
nomination.

Here is what the lieutenant writes:




 I believe that, while dean of Harvard Law School, [Elena 


 Kagan] adequately proved her support for those who had 


 served, were currently serving, and all those who felt called 


 to serve, including those like me who joined upon graduation 


 as well as those patriots who were not permitted to do so 


 under the policy of ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''


Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lieutenant Tressler's 
letter of support be printed in the Record.
