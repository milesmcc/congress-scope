Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment 
offered by the gentlelady from California and the gentleman from 
Florida.

With the fall of the Taliban, Afghan women came back from the brink. 
But the gains made since 2001 have been fragile. We recognize that any 
prospect of better lives for the women of Afghanistan and girls are 
inherently linked to the success of the development and reconstruction 
of their country.

Furthermore, we all desire greater levels of accountability, quality, 
and impact from foreign development assistance to Afghanistan, all 
aimed at creating the enabling environment necessary to sustain women's 
development successes, their security, and their basic rights.

Mr. Chairman, this amendment has that noble purpose. It would require 
the Inspectors General of the Department of State, the Department of 
Defense, the United States Agency for International Development, and 
the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction to include 
the impact that U.S. development assistance has on the social, 
economic, and political empowerment of Afghan women as part of their 
auditing and reporting requirements.

I support this amendment.

I yield back the balance of my time.
