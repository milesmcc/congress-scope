Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Chiropractic 
Care Available to All Veterans Act, H.R. 1017, as amended, which 
emphasizes the critical need for robust chiropractic services within 
the Department of Veterans Affairs.

In the theater today, Madam Speaker, servicemembers may carry up to 
55 pounds of combat equipment and armor. Consistently supporting such a 
heavy load places a serious strain on the backs and joints of our 
servicemembers, thereby causing musculoskeletal injuries. In fact, the 
VA reports that musculoskeletal disorders are the single most common 
ailment facing returning veterans. Among veterans of Operation Enduring 
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom who have received treatment from 
the VA, over 52 percent have been diagnosed with such a disorder; 
however, the VA is not presently equipped to serve this clear need.

Current law specifies that the VA must have at least one chiropractic 
care program in each of the 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks, or 
VISNs. Today, in-house chiropractic care is available at just 32 major 
VA facilities. This leaves veterans living near the remaining 121 
centers without access to chiropractic care at a VA facility.

Madam Speaker, H.R. 1017 would make chiropractic care available to 
all veterans at all VA medical centers by phasing in the establishment 
of such chiropractic care programs. The VA would be required to offer 
chiropractic care at 75 medical centers by the end of 2011 and at all 
VA medical centers by the end of 2013. This bill provides an 
opportunity to significantly expand access to chiropractic care for one 
of the most prevalent disorders facing veterans returning from Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

I urge the support of my colleagues and reserve the balance of my 
time.
