Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Massachusetts that two 
out of three Americans support an increase in the tobacco tax for this 
purpose. It is a clearly positive thing for us to do. So unlike the 
Iraq war, which we are not paying for at all in this instance, we are 
paying for children's health insurance with a tobacco tax, and I think 
that is a much more responsible approach.

Mr. President, I have a statement here on the hate crime issue, but I 
see two other colleagues on the floor, and I don't know what their 
schedules are.
