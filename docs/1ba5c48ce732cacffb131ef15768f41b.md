`Mr. EMANUEL â€” 3 May 2007`

Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to hate and discrimination, 
America speaks with one voice, ''no.'' Zero tolerance. You cannot be a 
beacon of freedom around the world and fail that test here at home.

President Kennedy was moved on the civil rights movement because he 
understood, in the battle of the Cold War, you could not be a beacon 
for freedom against intolerance around the world if we weren't free 
here at home. You could not. And as we talk, all our colleagues always 
say, as we battle on the issues on the war in Iraq, Islamic fascism, 
the whole world will watch what we say here in Congress.

People will watch this vote and understand, most importantly, whether 
America remains true to its principles on freedom or not. People will 
watch this vote. And I would hope my colleagues will remember, as we do 
this today, that every time America widens the circle of democracy to 
protect more of its citizens who sit in the shadows, it is true to its 
principles.

I would hope people will vote ''yes'' on this legislation.
