# PRESERVING UNITED STATES ATTORNEY INDEPENDENCE ACT OF 2007
## `fa504dc84caddac6caf00edfa978cdc7`
`Mr. DURBIN â€” 19 March 2007`

---


Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to speak on two timely issues. 
I would like to first speak on the issue of S. 214, the bill pending 
before the Senate.

I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate who followed this 
debate over the firing of eight U.S. attorneys to reflect a little bit 
about history. It was over a century ago that the U.S. Department of 
Justice undertook plans to fire certain Federal prosecutors in the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Alabama for political reasons. It was August 9, 
1904, when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt wrote a letter to 
his Attorney General, William H. Moody. In this letter, President 
Theodore Roosevelt opposed the political firing of Federal prosecutors. 
This is what he said:




 Of all of the officers of the Government, those of the 


 Department of Justice should be kept most free from any 


 suspicion of improper action on partisan or factional grounds 


 . . . so that there will be gradually a growth, even though a 


 slow growth, in the knowledge that the Federal courts and the 


 representatives of the Federal Department of Justice insist 


 on meting out even-handed justice to all.


Those words were spoken over 100 years ago. They ring true today. Our 
democracy is based on the rule of law. It is based on meting out 
evenhanded justice, as President Theodore Roosevelt said.

The forced firing of eight U.S. attorneys, nearly all of whom had 
been judged qualified and favorably reviewed, calls into question the 
credibility and integrity of Federal prosecutors. It calls into 
question our Nation's commitment to even-handed justice.

I have heard my colleagues on the floor today and in committee say: 
This is much ado about nothing because whenever a new President comes 
along, they replace all of the U.S. attorneys; that is clearly 
political. They are replacing those serving as U.S. attorneys with 
people of their own choosing after they have replaced the Attorney 
General. There is truth to that.

The fact is, with the new Attorney General, a new team is in place. 
We have 93 U.S. attorneys. As President George W. Bush took office a 
little over 6 years ago, he replaced all of those U.S. attorneys 
appointed by President Clinton with his own. No one called for an 
investigation. No one screamed


''scandal.'' It is a tradition. It is one we accept. A new President 
has that chance. But we know those U.S. attorneys serve at the 
President's discretion and can be removed at any time for any reason.

We have an unusual circumstance we face right now. Never before in 
history has a President and an Attorney General fired a group of U.S. 
attorneys en masse, in a group, other than the expected turnover, as I 
mentioned, with the change of administration.

We asked the Congressional Research Service if they could undertake 
an analysis of U.S. attorney firings that occurred other than the 
changeover of a Presidency. This is what they found: Only 2 U.S. 
attorneys out of 486 confirmed by the Senate over the past 25 years 
have been fired in the middle of a Presidential term for reasons 
unrelated to misconduct--2 out of 486. So for some to argue that this 
is routine, to fire those attorneys, the facts say otherwise. Only 2 
out of 486 have been fired in the midst of their term.

Why is that the case? Why have U.S. attorneys been insulated from 
Presidential politics? Because Federal prosecutors are supposed to be 
independent. They are nominated by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate, but, unlike other Federal public servants, they have a measure 
of independence.

Former Supreme Court Justice and Attorney General Robert Jackson once 
said: The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and 
reputation than any other person in America.

Discussing Justice Jackson's words, a scholar of the Justice 
Department named Lincoln Caplan has written:




 The power of law enforcement to tarnish reputations, end 


 people's liberty and ruin lives, in other words, is so great 


 that it has to be exercised judiciously and, above all, 


 nonpolitically. That's one basic element of the rule of law.


That is what is at stake here. Eight U.S. attorneys who did not play 
ball with the political agenda of this White House were dropped from 
the team. Members of Congress have a responsibility to ask: What was 
that political agenda? Why were they dismissed? Does this scandal rest 
at the feet of the Attorney General, Mr. Gonzales; Harriet Miers, the 
former counsel to the President; Karl Rove, the President's political 
adviser; or does it reach the President's office itself?

Over the next several weeks, we are going to look into this. Passage 
of S. 214, the bill we will vote on at the end of this debate, will not 
end the inquiry. We have a lot more work to do. We need to learn 
whether Attorney General Gonzales and his deputies told Congress the 
truth when they testified just a few weeks ago. We need to have Karl 
Rove, Harriet Miers, and other top administration officials testify 
under oath about their role in these firings. I hope they will come 
voluntarily. If they do not, the Senate Judiciary Committee should 
subpoena each and every one of them. I am a member of that committee. 
We plan to vote on these subpoenas this Thursday.

The White House is reluctant to have senior officials testify. That 
is understandable. But when the shoe was on the other foot--a 
Democratic President and a Republican Congress--administration 
officials testified all the time. Under President Clinton, 47 White 
House officials testified before congressional committees during their 
service. We need to hear the truth--all of it and nothing but the 
truth--about the firing of the eight U.S. attorneys.

There is a second question we have to ask which is equally important: 
How many other U.S. attorneys were approached by the White House and 
asked to play ball and did play ball? Of the Nation's 93 U.S. 
attorneys, how many of them kept their jobs as a result of political 
cooperation?


We gained some insight into this question from a new study by two 
professors, John Cragan of Illinois State University and Donald Shields 
at the University of Missouri. They compiled a database of Federal 
indictments and investigations undertaken by U.S. attorneys against 
elected officials and political candidates since President Bush took 
office in 2001. Here is what their study found: U.S. attorneys across 
the Nation have investigated 298 Democrats and just 67 Republicans--
nearly 5 times as many Democratic officials as Republicans. These 
statistics are troubling, and we have to look into them. The firings of 
the U.S. attorneys and documents that have been turned over to Congress 
really call into question the legitimacy of all prosecutions brought by 
the U.S. attorney in cases involving partisan interests.

This is regrettable. There is no place for politics when it comes to 
prosecution, especially when it comes to public corruption and voting 
rights cases. If there is belief that people in the White House in 
either party are pushing for prosecutions to seek a political 
advantage, we have seriously undermined the integrity and credibility 
of our system of justice.

As President Teddy Roosevelt warned: Even the appearance of political 
interference in the process of justice is damaging to public faith in 
Government. Last night, as I left a Chicago restaurant, a young man and 
his wife were sitting at a table. He asked me to come over. He 
introduced himself and said he was an assistant U.S. attorney in 
Chicago. That is a hard job to get. It is not a political job at all. 
In fact, you have to be really talented to be qualified to serve in the 
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois.

He said to me: Senator, I would like to ask you to do your best to 
get to the bottom of this. We think we are doing a professional job. 
This suggestion that some U.S. attorneys were fired for political 
reasons really casts a shadow over all of us who are trying to 
represent the people of the United States effectively through our 
Department of Justice.

We owe it to him. We owe it to the U.S. attorneys across this country 
who have been independent in their judgment and all of the assistants 
who work with them to get to the bottom of this and ask the important 
questions. I hope the Senate Judiciary Committee will be able to move 
this week, perhaps next week, to get to the bottom of this and call 
these witnesses before us.

Mr. President, today marks a somber milestone. It was 4 years ago 
today that President Bush ordered our military to launch a preemptive 
invasion of Iraq. I can recall the vote on the Senate floor--I have 
spoken of it many times--which led to that decision by the President. 
We cast thousands of votes as Members of the Senate, the House, and 
most of them are hard to remember. One can never forget a vote cast 
about war. You know people will die as a result of that decision. We 
focus on eliminating the enemy--as we do in our war in Afghanistan--but 
we know good American soldiers will give their lives as well, and 
innocent people will die.


I can remember well that decision. It was a tough one, a very 
difficult one. But now we face 4 years of this war having been 
completed. As of today, we start the fifth year of this war, a war that 
has lasted longer than World War II.

Yesterday, on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Stephen Hadley, the 
President's National Security Adviser, was asked: If the President had 
known 5 years ago how much this war would cost--in dollars and in 
lives--would he have still ordered this invasion of Iraq?

Mr. Hadley replied:




 I think he would. The point is, this war has made the U.S. 


 safer.


Those were the words of Stephen Hadley. Unfortunately, they are 
wrong.

A National Intelligence Estimate released last spring warns that the 
war in Iraq has helped create a whole new generation of terrorists 
around this world.

The latest report from the Defense Department confirms our troops are 
now trapped in a civil war. For the longest time, we danced around 
using the words ''civil war.'' But even that term does not adequately 
express the complexity of the deadly situation we find ourselves in 
today.

Before our military was diverted to fight this war of choice in Iraq, 
they had driven the Taliban from power in Afghanistan and splintered 
the leadership of al-Qaida. We were in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. We 
knew who was responsible for 9/11, and we were determined to get him 
and those who worked for him. We were on track to demolish the 
terrorists who brought such grief to our Nation on 9/11.

What is the story today? According to Mr. Hadley in his comments 
yesterday on television, the war has made us ''safer.'' The fact is, 
today al-Qaida is regrouping and the Taliban is still fiercely fighting 
for control of Afghanistan.

Our military--especially the Army--is stretched to the breaking 
point.


There is not one Active or Reserve Army combat unit outside of Iraq and 
Afghanistan today that is rated ''combat ready''--not one. If we were 
called on to respond to another military emergency in the world with 
our great military, they would be hard pressed to respond because they 
have been depleted in terms of personnel and resources and training and 
equipment by this war in Iraq.

National Guard units in Illinois and across the Nation have about 
one-third of the equipment they need to respond to a domestic crisis or 
to train for an overseas mission. A recent audit by the Department of 
Defense inspector general found the Pentagon has failed to properly 
equip the soldiers it already has in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many 
soldiers have found themselves short on guns and ammunition, body 
armor, communications equipment, armored vehicles, and electronic 
jammers to disable IEDs.

Two hours ago, I was at Walter Reed Hospital. I make visits there and 
try to meet with soldiers and talk to them about how they are doing. I 
go to the rehab unit where amputees are trying to learn to walk. Some 
have lost one leg, some two. Some have lost an arm. They are struggling 
to get their lives back together. These are real heroes for America, 
and they are profiles in courage, as they struggle every single day to 
try to put their lives back together again.

I sat down with a group of these soldiers, all of whom had lost a 
leg, in this rehab room. I went around, and I said: What happened to 
you? Each one of them said the same thing: Well, it was an IED that hit 
my humvee. It was an IED that hit my humvee. It was an IED that hit my 
humvee.

I thought to myself: When this war started, in my first visit to 
Walter Reed, I met a member of the Ohio National Guard who lost his 
left leg. He could not wait to get back to his unit. I doubted if he 
ever would. I asked him what happened? He said: Well, this homemade 
bomb, this IED, hit my humvee. That was 4 years ago, and we still have 
soldiers coming into our hospitals with similar injuries without the 
protection they need.

The President's response to this terrible situation is to order 
30,000 more troops into battle.

We will pay for this war for the rest of our lives. But the people 
who have paid the highest price, by far, are the men and women of the 
military and their families. Many soldiers and marines, sailors and 
airmen in Iraq are on their second, even their third or fourth tour of 
duty. We are pushing them to the absolute limit. They have endured 
great danger. Their families have endured great hardships.

As of this morning, it is sad but must be reported that 3,210 
American soldiers, including 123 from my home State of Illinois, have 
given everything. They have given their lives in Iraq.

This is a hallowed rollcall. These are the names of every Illinois 
servicemember killed in Iraq since the start of this war. As we begin 
the fifth year of this war, I ask unanimous consent to honor these 
great men and women by having printed immediately after my remarks in 
the Congressional Record this list of those Illinois brave soldiers and 
marines, airmen and sailors who have given their lives in Iraq.
