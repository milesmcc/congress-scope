`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 6 February 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as my good friend on the other side 
of the aisle frequently reminded us last year, the Senate is not the 
House. It is not possible in this body for the majority to dictate to 
the minority the contents of this debate. What we are asking for, by 
any standard, is reasonable: One alternative--just one--to the proposal 
on which my good friend, the majority leader, is seeking to get a vote. 
We don't object to having this debate. We are ready and willing to have 
this debate, anxious to have this debate, but we insist on fundamental 
fairness.

The Gregg amendment is about the troops. How can we have a debate on 
Iraq and have no debate about the troops? Do we support them or don't 
we? That is what the Gregg amendment is about, and Senate Republicans 
insist that we consider those who are being sent to Iraq, over and 
above the current troops deployed there, in our debate, which is 
entirely about the additional troops going to Iraq.

I assume the whole genesis of this debate this week is the question 
of additional troops going to Baghdad under the direction of General 
Petraeus to try to quiet the capital city and allow this fledgling 
democracy to begin to take hold. And the Gregg amendment--Senator Gregg 
is right here on the floor of the Senate and is fully capable of 
explaining what the Gregg amendment is about. I ask the Senator from 
New Hampshire, what is the essence of the Gregg amendment which we seek 
to have voted on in the context of this Iraq war?
