Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, every day that the Defense appropriations 
conference report is delayed, it delays a $40 billion increase for the 
Department of Defense, delays $11.6 billion for mine-resistant vehicles 
for our troops in Iraq and a $2.9 billion increase for our veterans.

The Defense appropriations conference report passed the House of 
Representatives 400 to 15. I urge all Senators to support the 
conference report and send the measure to the President of the United 
States today.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
