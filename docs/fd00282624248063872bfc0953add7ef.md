Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, during a speech at the Republican National 
Convention in 2004, President Bush said, ''In a new term, we will lead 
an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are 
eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance 
programs.'' But instead the President, just minutes ago, vetoed health 
insurance for 10 million low-income children.

The President's objections were without merit and did not warrant a 
veto. The bill does not expand the CHIP program. Instead, it maintains 
current eligibility requirements while enrolling more uninsured 
children. It is not a move towards ''socialized health care.'' States 
will continue to receive funding through block grants, which nearly all 
States use. And this investment in the health care of our Nation's 
children is fully paid for, unlike the President's ongoing Iraq funding 
requests.

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely had hoped the President would have a change 
of heart and fulfill his promise to enroll children in this health care 
program. But he failed to do so. Now every Member of this House must 
vote to override the President to provide for the health care of 
America's children.
