Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have a number of issues I want to 
bring up today for the record to explain a lot of the things we are 
faced with here as we wind down before Christmas Eve--maybe.

The first thing I am going to do is ask to have printed in the Record 
a list of the California-connected servicemembers who have died in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. I have put their names in the Record continually. 
And sometimes, if I have time, I read them. I want to say this: Since 
August 5, 52 more California-connected servicemembers have died in 
Afghanistan, and 2 more have died in Iraq.

I ask unanimous consent to have their names printed in the Record.
