Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased to grant the 
gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) 2 minutes, noting that 
in the Iraq war he has lost more than any other Member, more members 
from his district than any other district in the United States.

Therefore, I know he feels strongly about Lane, who devoted his 
entire time in the Congress to focusing on veterans and their needs.

(Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA asked and was given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.)
