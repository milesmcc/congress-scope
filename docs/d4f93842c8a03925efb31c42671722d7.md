Mr. PUTNAM. Mr. Speaker, our troops in combat deserve to be sent the 
resources and reinforcements that they need to be successful in their 
mission in Iraq, without strings and without delay.

Putting in place an inflexible timeline that culminates with a date 
certain time for withdrawal micromanages our commanders in the field 
and undermines the efforts of our troops on the ground. The Washington 
Post describes the Democrat plan as ''an attempt to impose detailed 
management on a war without regard for the war itself.''

The L.A. Times called for the bill to be vetoed saying, ''It's absurd 
to try and micromanage the conflict, and the evolution of Iraqi 
society, with arbitrary timetables and benchmarks.''

I urge my colleagues to stand up for our troops. Our troops deserve a 
clean bill, not one bulging with add-ons and political statements.
