`Mr. KAGEN â€” 17 November 2010`

Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I received a message from one of my 
constituents, one of my bosses, Mr. and Mrs. Elmo Roach, from northeast 
Wisconsin, which reads, in part: ''Do not waver on beginning to bring 
our troops out of Afghanistan, saving more of wasteful spending. 
Redirect all accrued military savings to veterans, to paying our troops 
and supporting their families.

''Sorry to say, but we may be ready to retreat to the comfort of our 
well-earned retirement if the President blinks or compromises.

''He promised, we delivered, now we expect him to act like Truman or 
Roosevelt.''



You see, in northeast Wisconsin we still believe that people are more 
important than corporate profits. We still believe that one single 
family on Main Street is more valuable than all of the corporations on 
Wall Street. We also believe that our freedoms will be ours for only as 
long as we can hang on to them.
