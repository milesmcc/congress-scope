Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Globally, women work two-thirds of the world's 
working hours and produce half of the world's food, and still we earn 
only 1 percent of the world's income and own less than 1 percent of the 
world's property.

Of the 300 million people living in poverty, 70 percent are girls and 
women. Millions of women and girls are trafficked, physically abused, 
sexually abused, or face the threat of violence every day.



Although Congress passed the PROTECT Act to prevent trafficking in 
Iraq, Darfur, Afghanistan and many other places around the world, we 
still see that women and girls tend to be the targets of extreme 
violence, brutality, and intimidation.

So, Mr. Speaker, it's important that Congress recognize the 
importance of March 8. I am so glad that we passed this resolution. I 
am grateful to the Congress for recognizing International Women's Day, 
which we just celebrated on March 8.
