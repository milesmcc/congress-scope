`Mr. POE â€” 23 October 2007`

---


Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Lance Corporal Jeremy Burris, 22, was buried 
last week in Liberty, Texas, after being killed in Iraq. This young 
marine was honored at a funeral by the entire town for his heroism.

But a few days after his funeral, outlaws desecrated Jeremy's grave 
site. Some reports indicate the suspected criminals may have been 
antiwar peaceniks that commit violence in the name of peace. They 
disrespect and dishonor the dead by their vandalism.

But whoever committed such dastardly deeds should be quickly captured 
by the local sheriff. After these grave-desecrating criminals are 
convicted, they should be sentenced to serve time at Gitmo prison in 
Guantanamo Bay. After all, that is where America houses other war 
criminals.

So, Mr. Speaker, those that commit crimes against the graves of our 
fallen war dead are nothing more than war criminals and should be 
treated as such, because justice is the one thing we should always 
find.

And that's just the way it is.
