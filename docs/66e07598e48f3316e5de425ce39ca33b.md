# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the supplemental appropriations bill 
for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In Iraq, the American people were misled into a war that has cost our 
country almost $670 billion, with over 4,300 American lives lost and 
estimates showing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed. While 
President Obama's plan to scale down the troop levels in Iraq is a move 
in the right direction, I simply cannot justify any more spending for 
an illegitimate war.

In Afghanistan, over 600 Americans have been killed and more than 
4,000 have been wounded. After years of mismanagement by the Bush 
Administration, we lack a clear objective and have no exit strategy.

At a time when our country is facing serious economic peril at home, 
it is unconscionable that we would be sending almost $100 billion to 
further fund war efforts that have no clear goals and continue to 
undermine America's standing abroad.

President Obama is moving America's foreign policy in a better 
direction, and he has shown superior judgment to President Bush on when 
we should send our troops into harm's way. However, I cannot support 
any more funding for these wars.
