Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank 
our Nation's veterans and their families for their dedication, their 
service and their sacrifice.

As we approach Veterans Day, I commend the Democratic leadership for 
working with our Senate colleagues to pass a Veterans appropriations 
bill last night. This bill is the largest increase in veterans funding 
ever, $3.7 billion over what the President asked.

This bill will provide our veterans with desperately needed health 
care services, including funds specifically allocated to treat the 
rising number of veterans with traumatic brain injury and PTSD.

To date, we have lost more than 4,000 troops and 30,000 troops have 
been wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq. We must do everything we can to 
take care of our servicemembers when they come home to their families 
and their communities, and we will bring them home. But until that day, 
this Congress will do everything we can to take care of our veterans 
and their families.
