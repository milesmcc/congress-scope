Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, the President's fiscal year 2008 budget 
requests funding for the Iraq war through 2009. The Democratic budget 
accepts that timeline. It includes $145.2 billion


for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as requested by the 
President for fiscal year 2008. It requests $50 billion for fiscal year 
2009. That is in addition to the $510 billion we have already spent on 
the war and another $97 billion pending in the supplemental, according 
to the CRS. The total, if approved, would be over $800 billion for war, 
while our schools, our health care and the quality of our environment 
are in decline. The budget should reflect the mandate Democrats were 
given in November, yet we are mirroring the President's plan for the 
war and his budget request to fund the war.

The supplemental calls for withdrawal by August 2008. Why does the 
budget encourage the war to continue into 2009? If we were serious 
about trying to stop the war, the budget should not contradict the 
supplemental language.

This budget does not end the war, it continues it through the end of 
President Bush's term. The American people want the war to end now, not 
in 2008, not in 2009, but the people want the war to end now.
