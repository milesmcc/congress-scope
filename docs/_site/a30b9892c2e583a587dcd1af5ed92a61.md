Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues raising the 
issue of Congressional oversight in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the 
debate here today. I share their deep reservations about our engagement 
in the region, though I disagree with their invocation of the War 
Powers Act in this case. In fact, the targeted cooperation and training 
that U.S. Special Forces are said to be conducting in the mountainous 
border area of Pakistan will likely do more to help us in the long run 
than doubling down with a troop surge in Afghanistan.

Though I cannot support this resolution, I support the spirit of 
oversight and accountability behind it. Because I believe our strategy 
in Afghanistan is fundamentally flawed and cannot succeed without a 
credible partner in the Afghan government, I hope we can have a serious 
and vigorous debate about this--the real issue--in the coming months.
