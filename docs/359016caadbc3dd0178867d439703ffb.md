Mr. PERLMUTTER. I have to agree with my friend, Mr. Lewis from 
California. You're right, there will be other supplementals. The 
purpose is that these supplementals are not going to become a regular 
course of business as they have been as it applies to Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

With respect to your points about the housing of these prisoners, 
nobody wants these particular prisoners in their State or in their 
prison system; but on the other hand, we have very unsavory characters 
from time to time in various prisons across the country. Fort 
Leavenworth might be an appropriate place. But the amendment, as Mr. 
Obey has projected it, is no money within this appropriation will be 
used for release or transfer. And so the amendment is an attempt to 
strike a compromise between your concerns and the concerns of our 
caucus, and that's what this whole process is about.
