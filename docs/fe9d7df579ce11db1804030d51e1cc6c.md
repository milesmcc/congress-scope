Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote 
at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow on the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to 
S. 2340, the Senate Iraq Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill; if 
cloture is not invoked, the Senate then vote on cloture on the motion 
to proceed to H.R. 4156, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment 
Appropriations bill; if that cloture is not invoked, the Senate then 
vote on cloture on the substitute amendment to the farm bill; I further 
ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on H.R. 2419, the 
underlying bill, be delayed to occur, if needed, upon the adoption of 
the substitute amendment; I further ask unanimous consent that the time 
for debate prior to the first vote be equally divided between the two 
leaders or their designees; that the last 10 minutes be reserved for 
the two leaders, with the majority controlling the last 5 minutes; and 
that there be 2 minutes for debate before the second and third votes.
