`Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts â€” 19 December 2007`

Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, let me clear up what the 
gentleman said as the Democrat he quoted previously. They have decided 
to borrow the money for Iraq, almost all $800 billion of it on the 
Republican side, $800 billion.

Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 1 minute to a leader in the Blue 
Dog Coalition, a friend, and on this issue in particular I think a 
voice of great reason, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Boyd).

(Mr. BOYD of Florida asked and was given permission to revise and 
extend his remarks.)
