Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at the outset, this the penultimate DOD 
authorization bill for the distinguished Senator from Virginia. What a 
leader he has been on defense issues for his 30 years in the Senate. He 
will have an opportunity to do one more before he rides off into the 
sunset, much to our regret.

I also would like to congratulate Senator Levin for his work on this 
important conference report, which is, indeed, a bipartisan 
achievement. I was particularly pleased to see that the committee 
provided full authorization for the supplemental funding for our troops 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was pleased to see the committee recommended 
no policy changes to the Petraeus plan.

The Wounded Warriors legislation, which we passed earlier in the 
year, is also included. The Wounded Warriors bill is vitally important 
to our men and women in uniform and important to the people of the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky.

So I thank the managers of the conference report. This is an 
important accomplishment for our men and women in uniform, who we can 
all agree are deserving of this body's full support and our deepest 
gratitude.
