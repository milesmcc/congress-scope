# THE BUDGET, DEBT AND THE BLUE DOG'S IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY LEGISLATION
## `5fccfb96aea8ef3e87515b2bdb1d9de8`
`Mr. SCOTT of Georgia â€” 27 February 2007`

Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. If the gentleman would yield, you bring up a 
very good point. The waste that has happened in Iraq with our military 
is just astounding. It is very important that the American people 
realize this is the trust of our legislation. We are going to support 
the troops. We are going to have a military and we are going to spend 
more on our military. We are going to enlarge our military. Under our 
Democratic leadership, we are going to make our military stronger.

In order to do that, there are two important points, as the gentleman 
pointed out, in our legislation that will address and act as a catch to 
stop some of this waste, and that is under our legislation, we will 
require that the Inspector General in the Defense Department report to 
Congress quarterly on exactly how the money that Congress is allocating 
is being spent. And the Inspector General in Iraq for the 
Reconstruction of Iraq will also report to Congress on how that money 
is being spent.

So our financial accountability act for Iraq accountability is very 
important, and I want to just take a minute to point those things out 
that address how we are going to respond to the concerns of waste and 
fraud that you have just spoken about.
