Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, as President Bush moves forward with his 
unpopular plan to send an additional 22,000 troops to Iraq, it is 
crucial that this Congress take a hard look at how this surge affects 
our national security throughout the rest of the world.

Last week, General James Conway, the Marine Corps Commandant, told 
the House Armed Services Committee that if troops were needed somewhere 
else in the world, the response would be a lot slower than we might 
like. Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker went as far as saying that 
pooling resources for troops in Iraq limits our ability to respond to 
emerging strategic contingencies.

Mr. Speaker, after hearing all these warnings from military officials 
about the President's escalation plan, Congress must step in and voice 
its opposition in the name of protecting our national security. The 
days of rubber stamping the President's war plans are over.
