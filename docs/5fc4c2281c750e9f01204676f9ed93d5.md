Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, this is drawing to a close. I think that so much has 
been said, not nearly enough. I appreciate my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle who have done such a good job of making this a 
bipartisan piece of legislation.

Additionally, I would like to echo the last speaker because the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania, rightfully so, reminded us that the men 
and women in our Armed Forces, in which he served and in which I 
served, know the rules; they know the rules that we operate under, and 
we know the penalty if we break those rules. We know that if our 
country were to, in fact, torture somebody, we would both punish those 
who did it and compensate those who were treated in any inconsistent 
way with the rule of law. We only ask that the post-Saddam Iraq, if 
they're paying compensation and apologizing to others, they do the same 
to the men who suffered at their hands.

So I think that for all the men and women serving in the Armed Forces 
today and those who have served in the past, this Congress, on a 
bipartisan basis, is taking a giant step toward saying we will hold 
others accountable as we have always held our own accountable.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
