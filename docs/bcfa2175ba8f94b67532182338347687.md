`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 7 February 2008`

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, let me just get 
this right. So we have spent billions upon billions of dollars, another 
170 this year, on the war in Iraq, which is feeding the international 
terrorist movement, and this isn't our saying it, that's the 22 most 
important national intelligence organizations through the National 
Intelligence Estimate, that is feeding the frenzy of international 
terrorism and is growing the ranks of the people who want to do harm to 
us. So we're spending money in Iraq to increase the ranks of people who 
might do harm to us, and then we are cutting the money here at home 
that would make sure that none of them lands on our soil and does harm 
to us. That is a very odd thing for the President or the Republicans or 
anyone who supports that policy to have to explain to somebody.
