Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, you know, one of the questions that I 
never hear asked and certainly don't hear answered by those who want to 
pull out of Iraq, like Harry Reid, who says the war is already lost, I 
have a question for him and others who say that the war is lost. As 
soon as America pulls out, the people like al Maliki, or Deputy Prime 
Minister Saleh, who was here in the Capitol last week, it would be a 
death sentence to them. All those folks who stepped forward who bought 
into the American and international concept of freedom and self-
government and democracy, they will be executed.


Now, what are we going to do? Are we going to give amnesty to 
political refugees, 50,000, 100,000? Maybe those on the left have an 
estimate of how many people we would open our border to.

But I can say this: There is no question about it, these folks who 
stepped forward to try to build a new government will be executed. 
Their children will be executed. Their spouses will be executed. Their 
grandparents will be executed. So inevitably we will open up the 
borders to them as political refugees. My question is, how many of 
those will we let in, and can we do that now on a bipartisan basis?
