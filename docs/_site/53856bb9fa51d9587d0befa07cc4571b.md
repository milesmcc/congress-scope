Mr. PLATTS. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 793, which, as 
was well delineated, reauthorizes this very important legislation, the 
Traumatic Brain Injury Act.

I am honored to join with Representative Bill Pascrell in introducing 
the House version of this legislation, which expands support systems 
for individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury. As the 
gentleman from New Jersey referenced, for the past 3 years, I have had 
the privilege of serving with him as cochair of the Congressional TBI 
Task Force.

I am pleased to recognize my distinguished colleague from New Jersey 
for his tremendous leadership and dedication related to TBI research 
and treatments over the course of many years. I have been delighted to 
serve as cochair for 3 years, but, long before that, the gentleman from 
New Jersey has been leading this effort and been a real champion of the 
importance of this work. I have been honored to work with the gentleman 
from New Jersey to bring awareness to the unique issues that surround 
TBI, such as frequent misdiagnoses and barriers to adequate and 
meaningful treatments.

Most Americans do not fully understand the amount of devastation 
caused by TBI each year. Most people do not realize that the incidence 
of TBI is greater than the incidence of breast cancer, HIV/AIDS, 
multiple sclerosis and spinal injuries combined.

Additionally, TBIs can manifest themselves in various manners, from a 
small behavioral change to complete physical disability and even death. 
Brain injuries affect the whole family emotionally and financially, 
often resulting in substantial medical and rehabilitation expenses.

The TBI Act of 1996 produced extensive research at the National 
Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
regarding the incidence, detection and diagnosis of TBI. The time has 
come to better use these results and translate them into more extensive 
treatments. This is an important part of what Senate bill 793 aims to 
do.

In addition to expanding the research of NIH and CDC, this 
legislation will build on the support systems that States have already 
implemented to increase the independence and productivity of 
individuals living with TBI.

Soldiers returning from Iraq have brought much-needed attention to 
the variety of symptoms associated with TBI. Thanks to the state-of-
the-art body armor with which our men and women overseas are equipped, 
these heroic individuals are able to survive violent attacks while 
receiving blunt force to the head. Studies have found that over 60 
percent of all soldiers wounded in an explosion, vehicle accidents, 
gunshot wound to the head or neck sustain a traumatic brain injury.

This legislation provides additional support for States to integrate 
veterans into community-based treatments after these heroes return home 
from combat.

This is a bill aimed at helping individuals who, due to traumatic 
experiences, may never live their lives the same way again. Senate bill 
793 builds on current research and support systems to help vulnerable 
individuals lead a more comfortable, productive and independent life.

I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and, I, 
again, commend my colleague from New Jersey for his great leadership in 
advancing this cause.
