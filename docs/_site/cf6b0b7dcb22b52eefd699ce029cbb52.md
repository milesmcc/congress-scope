`Mr. BRALEY of Iowa â€” 27 July 2010`

Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this 
bill but also to voice my strong concerns with the direction of the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. While I fully support ensuring the safety 
of our Nation's troops, I have serious concerns over the provisions of 
this bill related to the funding of the conflicts. I have long 
advocated a responsible withdrawal from Afghanistan and believe that 
the continued funding of these wars outside of the appropriations 
process without a plan in place for withdrawal is reckless and 
wasteful. I firmly believe that Congress must require a responsible 
exit strategy from Afghanistan and work to ensure that the withdrawal 
of U.S. forces from Iraq remains on track.

Over the weekend, severe weather across Iowa caused heavy rains, 
thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes, and flooding that devastated numerous 
communities in my district. I support this bill today for the $5.1 
billion included to replenish the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
Disaster Relief Fund, which has been operating at a dangerously low 
level since the beginning of this year, halting recovery projects in 
Iowa and across the country from past disasters. With the recent 
disasters in my district, I believe this continued funding is vital to 
ensure that my constituents and other citizens who are faced with 
disaster have the necessary assistance to recover and rebuild from 
these devastating storms.

I applaud the House and Senate for acting today to ensure appropriate 
funding is available for disaster recovery and for other provisions in 
support of veterans, but I do not support another blank check for the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
