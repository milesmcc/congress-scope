Mr. YARMUTH. Well, certainly. And again, I referenced the fact that 
not only are we being allowed to, or being asked to write a blank check 
for hundreds of billions of dollars, as we've been writing for some 
time now, somewhere over $500 billion total in direct appropriations 
for the war in Iraq, but we're also being asked to give the Iraqi 
government a blank check; do whatever you want, no accountability, you 
get to it when you get to it, you'll decide when things are right for 
us to be able to leave. It's all up to you. We're helpless.

It's a very uncomfortable position for us to be in.
