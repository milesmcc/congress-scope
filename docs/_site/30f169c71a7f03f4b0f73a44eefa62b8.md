Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to pick up where my colleague, Senator 
Lieberman, left off. The question to ask is, how did the Taliban regain 
momentum? How do a bunch of fighters, who do not have one airplane, no 
navy, no heavy weapons to speak of, how could they have regained 
momentum and begun to reoccupy parts of Afghanistan?

The only answer I can come up with is a vacuum has been created. That 
vacuum has two components to it: the lack of governance and not enough 
troops to prevent the Taliban from coming back in some areas of 
Afghanistan.

I would submit this: If we wait to train the Afghan Army as the only 
way to stabilize Afghanistan, we are going to waste 2 or 3 years. It is 
going to get so bad we cannot stand the casualties, and the American 
people will not tolerate a 2- or 3-year period of where we are just 
training the Afghan forces, sending them from the training cycle into 
combat. They are going to fold, just like they did in Iraq. We cannot 
train an army and have them fight at the same time. We need a little 
bit of breathing space.

So this idea that we are going to train the Afghan Army, that is the 
way we will regain momentum against the Taliban, quite frankly will not 
work. I think Admiral Mullen understood that. What will work is to send 
more combat power to clear the Taliban from the areas that the Taliban 
have reoccupied. The Marines are telling us in no uncertain terms, with 
the right mix of troops they are delivering punishing blows to the 
Taliban. But we can send 1 million troops to Afghan and still not deal 
with the fundamental problems they face and the world faces, the 
legitimacy of the Afghan Government in the eyes of the Afghan people. 
That is why the Taliban have come back because the Afghan Government 
has failed. They have failed in almost every respect to give the Afghan 
people the governance and the hope they need to stand up to the 
Taliban.

So this is one Senator who believes the way to regain lost momentum 
is to add more combat power and, yes, train the Afghan Army and police 
force with a new strategy which we now have in place.

It is labor intensive. It is going to take a lot of time. We have to 
understand, if we get the Afghan Army up to 400,000, the whole budget 
of Afghanistan is $800 million a year. It will take $5 billion a year 
to maintain that army. We are going to end up paying. I hope the 
American taxpayer understands that. But it is cheaper for us to do that 
than it is for us to be the 400,000-person army.

So when it comes to cost, it is better to train them and help them 
with their training and funding than it is for us to stay over there in 
large numbers forever. But we are going to have to plus up to regain 
lost momentum. Then we are going to have to focus on the real cause of 
the deterioration--governance.

The Karzai government has failed in many ways. Corruption is rampant. 
If, in the next 6 months, some major figures in Afghanistan are not 
prosecuted for ripping off the Afghan people, then nothing will ever 
change over there.

I have been a military lawyer serving as a reservist in Afghanistan. 
I can tell you that everyone who has looked at the Rule of Law Programs 
will tell you that corruption, narcotics corruption,


is rampant in that country. They need a legal system in Afghanistan 
that can stand up to the corruption. That means we have to protect the 
judges from being assassinated; we have to build capacity.

There are less than 500 lawyers in all of Afghanistan. There are 
16,000 people in jail. Most of them went to jail without ever seeing a 
lawyer. We have our work cut out for us. We need benchmarks and 
measurements so I can go back to South Carolina and every Senator can 
go back to their constituents and say: We are not throwing good money 
after bad. We are going to push the Afghan Government to prosecute 
corruption, to provide security for judges, to find a way to empower 
the economy beyond the drug trade, and start making hard decisions 
about how tribal justice systems can be incorporated into the formal 
justice system.

There are so many decisions that politicians in Afghanistan have 
failed to make that have allowed the Taliban to come back. We need to 
put them on notice that with new resources and new troops, a new 
dynamic will be in place, and they will be making the decisions 
necessary to provide governance to their people. If they fail to do 
that, then they will not have our support because, at the end of the 
day, they have to want it more than we do.

Senator Lieberman is right about this. The good news amidst all of 
this bad news is the Taliban is very much reviled and hated in the 
country. But put yourselves in one of these villages out in the middle 
of Afghanistan. What would you do, knowing that by night the Taliban 
comes in and rains terror? We have to replace that dynamic and give the 
people assurance that we are not only going to provide them security 
but the Afghan Government is going to provide them schooling and 
education, health care, and some hope.

Finally, I cannot tell you that we will succeed with more troops. I 
can tell you, we will fail if we do not send more troops. It is so much 
harder in Afghanistan than in many ways it is in Iraq. We are not the 
Russians. We are not the British. This is not Vietnam. This is not 
Iraq.

This is Afghanistan where 9/11 was planned and executed. We can get 
this right.
