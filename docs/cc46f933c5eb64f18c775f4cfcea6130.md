Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I know our good friend from Rhode Island wants 
to talk about H.R. 3, which we will be considering tomorrow. But the 
Iraq Study Group, which you briefly touched on a few minutes ago. It is 
amazing how that just almost has faded into oblivion; that their 
recommendations, the number of months they worked, the expertise that 
was put together, led by former Secretary of State Mr. Baker and Mr. 
Hamilton, very well respected.

Nowhere in their recommendations, am I right, was there an escalation 
of troops. Was there any indication in the Iraq Study Group, who 
arguably is the finest group of experts that could have been put 
together to make recommendations, nowhere in there was an escalation of 
troops. At least from what I noticed, and you can correct me if I am 
wrong, the President essentially just dismissed their recommendation 
and moved on and went in the direction that he chose to go.

I would like to take this opportunity to yield to my good friend, to 
our good friend, the gentleman from Rhode Island, because we are 
dealing with an important piece of legislation tomorrow that has 
already been put on the President's desk once. And as part of the new 
direction for our Six in 2006 agenda, we are going to put it on his 
desk again, because maybe he will get it right a second time.
