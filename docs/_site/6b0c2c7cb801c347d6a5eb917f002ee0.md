Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it has been commonplace for critics of the 
war in Iraq to minimize, if not actually dismiss entirely, the links 
between Saddam Hussein and terrorists generally and al-Qaida 
specifically. This is part of a systematic effort by some, especially 
now that there are irrefutable signs of progress from the military


surge in Iraq, to change the narrative on the war. Instead of debating 
the way forward, they prefer instead to relitigate the past. In fact, 
earlier this month the distinguished majority leader stated:




 Prior to the invasion of Iraq, there was not a terrorist in 


 Iraq. And now, of course, there are lots of them.


It is true that there are a lot of terrorists in Iraq which, of 
course, is the reason why we are still there fighting them and need to 
stay there until they are defeated. But it is not true that there were 
no terrorists in Iraq prior to our invasion. In fact, Saddam's ties to 
terrorists are well known and were confirmed yet again in a recent 
report commissioned by the Pentagon's Joint Forces Command. This report 
found that Saddam Hussein actively supported and financed terrorist 
activities during the years he controlled Iraq. The report, entitled 
''Iraqi Perspectives Project: Saddam and Terrorism: Emerging Insights 
from Captured Iraqi Documents,'' was released on March 13. It was the 
product of the analysis of over 600,000 documents captured in Iraq 
since 2003. It concluded that Saddam's security forces and Osama bin 
Laden's terrorist network ''operated with similar aims (at least in the 
short term).''

According to the report:




 Though the execution of Iraqi terror plots was not always 


 successful, evidence shows that Saddam's use of terrorist 


 tactics and his support for terrorist groups remained strong 


 up until the collapse of his regime.


The report found that Saddam Hussein worked with several different 
terrorist groups, including groups with direct ties to al-Qaida. Many 
were engaged in a jihad against the United States and its allies. It 
wasn't necessary to read with excruciating detail the entire 1,600-page 
report to find proof of these links; all of the above was available for 
all to see in the brief abstract that accompanied the report.

Stephen Hayes offers extensive analysis of the entire report by the 
Joint Forces Command in the Weekly Standard magazine on March 24, 2008.

I ask unanimous consent to have his article printed in the Record.
