Mr. REID. For the information of all Members, we are working--Senator 
McConnell and I--on a consent agreement to deal with the Iraq debate 
tomorrow. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve the Iraq debate. 
Thursday, we will be able to deal with the U.S. attorneys bill and some 
judicial nominees. We do not have that worked out yet, so everyone stay 
tuned.

This will be the last vote today.
