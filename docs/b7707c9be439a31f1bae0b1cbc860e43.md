Mr. SKELTON. Gathering information, Madam Chairman, on Iraq's nuclear 
program is an important priority for our Congress. The November, 2007, 
National Intelligence Estimate provided the needed reappraisal of 
Iran's nuclear intentions and capabilities. This amendment is sure that 
that assessment process continues.

Given the differing conclusions between the then-NIE and its 
predecessor and their analysis of the status of Iran's nuclear program, 
it's appropriate that we continue to receive reports. This amendment 
details specific information necessary for congressional oversight, 
which we have been stressing in our committee all year long. This 
amendment replaces and improves on the text of our committee, which was 
of course approved on a bipartisan basis in our committee markup last 
week. This amendment appropriately identifies the Director of National 
Intelligence as the official to provide that assessment.

I think it's an excellent amendment. I thank the gentleman from South 
Carolina for clarifying the text and replacing it with this amendment.
