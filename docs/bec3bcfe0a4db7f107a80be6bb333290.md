Mr. WU. And most individuals agree that there are three reasons why 
the price is $128 a barrel rather than $60 a barrel. The three reasons 
are our presence in Iraq, instead of lowering the price of oil, it 
increased the price of oil; the permission from Wall Street to 
speculate on a purely financial basis in commodity futures; and the 
third reason is the lowering of the value of the U.S. dollar. Two of 
those policies are intentional policies, and the third policy was 
passed by the Republican Congress.
