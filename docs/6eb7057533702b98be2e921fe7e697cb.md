Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from New Mexico, a veteran 
and a C-130 pilot himself, and now a passenger in C-130s over in Iraq, 
year to year picking up firsthand information, veterans, active-duty 
personnel, just this last weekend. That's the level of involvement that 
you see here on the part of a lot of Members of the United States 
Congress, Mr. Speaker.

One of those other individuals who has had a high level of 
involvement is an individual who led codel Burgess in the last weekend 
of July over to Iraq, a number of stops, Bayji, Balad, Baghdad and 
Ramadi, those places come to mind. And I very much appreciate the 
leadership and the initiative it took to put that together and to lead 
that trip over there.

I would be happy to yield all but the last 3 or 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas, Dr. Burgess.
