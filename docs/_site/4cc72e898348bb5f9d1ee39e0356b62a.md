Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am very supportive of 
our troops around the globe and in particular those who are in harms 
way in Iraq. I wholeheartedly support H. Con. Res. 63.

Mr. Speaker, in the President's January 29, 2002, State of the Union 
address, in regards to protecting America, responding to the terrorist 
threat and capturing Osama bin Laden, he said (meaning Iraq): . . . 
This is a regime that agreed to international inspections--then kicked 
out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from 
the civilized world.

States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of 
evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of 
mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They 
provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their 
hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United 
States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be 
Catastrophic.

Secretary Rice, after being named Secretary of State to succeed Colin 
Powell, Secretary Rice warned six months before the invasion of Iraq 
that Saddam Hussein could deploy a nuclear weapon, saying that the 
administration did not ''want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.'' 
according to the Washington Post. We now know that these assertions 
were a fiction created by this administration to justify the 
unjustifiable.

U.S. Central Command Gen. Tommy Franks, the war's operational 
commander misjudged the interests of our Afghan allies. He ran the war 
from Tampa with no commander on the scene above the rank of lieutenant 
colonel. According to another Washington Post April 17, 2002, article; 
The first Americans did not arrive until 3 days into the fighting.

As a representative from NY whose constituents resent the lies and 
deception thrust upon us to justify this war and creating a distraction 
away from the homeland security we all desire the question is: When 
will Osama bin Laden be brought to justice.

The article continues by identifying that Osama bin Laden slipped 
through the cordon ostensibly placed around Tora Bora as U.S. aircraft 
began bombing on Nov. 30. More precisely, bin Laden was in Tora Bora on 
Nov. 26, spoke to his fighters about ''holy war'' then, as quickly as 
he had come, bin Laden vanished into the pine forests with four of his 
loyalists walking in the direction of Pakistan. bin Laden escaped 
according to the Christian Science Monitor, somewhere between Nov. 28 
to Nov. 30 as confirmed by Arabs and Afghans in eastern Afghanistan.

Mr. Speaker, I support our troops and that is why we must commence 
the redeployment of our troops today. Thus far:

There are 135,544 troops in Iraq today. 3127 or 2.3 percent of U.S. 
soldiers have been killed in service to our country.

Seventeen percent or 23,279 U.S. soldiers have been seriously wounded 
in service to our country.

Twenty percent of the troops wounded have received serious brain or 
spinal injuries; 30 percent of U.S. troops develop serious mental 
health problems within 3 to 4 months of returning home.

During the President's tenure, he has requested a cumulative total of 
more than $700 billion to pay for the war effort in Iraq; $9 billion of 
U.S. taxpayers money is unaccounted for.

The State of New York has lost 143 soldiers, 16 from Brooklyn. U.S. 
troops continue to die from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have 
been sent to Iraq with poorly constructed and poorly armored equipment. 
Pentagon war planners have created a high level task force that has 
spent $6.7 billion on how to combat IEDs.

Thousands of Americans are dead, thousand more will die if we don't 
get our troops home and get them redeployed today. I oppose the 
President's call for 21,000 more troops to go to Iraq. I support our 
troops and that's why I want them home where they belong.
