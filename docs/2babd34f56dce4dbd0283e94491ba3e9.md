Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, today I rise in honor of a man who 
dedicated his life to helping others, Mr. John Gaffaney of San Diego, 
California. Tragically, John was killed on November 5, 2009, a victim 
of the horrible events at Fort Hood.

John was a man of sacrifice and devotion who spent his life 
counseling others. After 15 years in the Army National Guard, he went 
on to work for the San Diego County Department of Health and Human 
Services. After spending the last 22 years investigating cases of 
elderly abuse and neglect for San Diego County, John once again 
answered the call of duty and re-enlisted in the Army Reserves. He 
arrived at Fort Hood only a few short weeks ago to prepare for 
deployment to Afghanistan to help other soldiers cope with the trauma 
of war.

Madam Speaker, John Gaffaney was a man of integrity and will be 
greatly missed by all of San Diego, especially his wife Christine and 
son Matthew. I ask that this body honor John and the rest of the fallen 
at Fort Hood for their dedication and sacrifice to this country.
