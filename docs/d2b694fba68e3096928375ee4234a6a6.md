Mr. REID. Madam President, I say, through the Chair to my friend, I 
want to legislate on this bill. If someone can come up with a better 
way that we do it, I am happy to do that.

As we know, if this vehicle is here, standing alone, anyone can offer 
any amendment on anything. I do not think that is helpful to the 
process. I do not want to stop them. If there are amendments over here 
to offer, I have said once, twice--this is the third time--more power 
to you, offer them. I don't wish to stand in the way of anyone offering 
an amendment. I don't want to be dealing with the war in Iraq, abortion 
or anything else which are some things that are very difficult to deal 
with. That is my whole purpose in doing this. I want to deal with FAA 
or anything within the realm of transportation. I hope everyone 
understands that. I will be happy--if somebody can figure out a 
different way to do this, let me know, and I will be happy to 
cooperate.


Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.
