Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for his introduction here and I 
thank you for your leadership. The gentleman from Kentucky is taking 
us, hopefully, on what will be a bipartisan effort to restore the 
responsibilities of this Congress has under article I and just sort of 
bring that back to the forefront because checks and balances are very 
important in this government. I also want to commend the leadership of 
our president, Tim Walz, the gentleman from Minnesota, who is an 
outspoken advocate for the people that he represents, and, frankly, 
that's what article I is all about.

As you point out, when we were elected to Congress, we were elected 
to represent the people of our districts. Not lobbyists on K Street and 
not operatives at the White House or even the President himself. Our 
responsibility and our loyalty are to the Americans, the people, first 
and foremost, who sent us here. That means we have to do the job that 
they asked us to do. And that job is important, and we know exactly 
what that job is because article I in some ways is a job description. 
As you point out, it's not about really just authority; it's about 
responsibilities. Nowhere in that job description in article I does it 
say we have to protect egos or political interests of the executive 
branch. Nowhere does it say that we have to do only things that the 
President tells us to do. And nowhere in that job description does it 
say that Congress answers to anyone but the American people.

There has sort of been a slope here where past Congresses have ceded 
legislative power to the executive branch, and, frankly, I believe that 
when that happens, Congress is falling down on their job. I am really 
glad that we are here tonight to reinvigorate and rededicate ourselves 
to make sure that we are fulfilling our obligations and our function 
under article I because it is vitally important to so many issues, from 
the war in Iraq to all these judiciary issues.
