Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have heard this week in 
publicized reports of the activities that are going on around the world 
with respect to al Qaeda. The National Intelligence Estimate has 
indicated publicly, nonclassified information, that this group is 
franchising. It means that they are able to spread without leadership 
around the world. And those who have followed the Iraq war recognize 
that it is a training ground for those terrorists who would then leave 
and spread their viciousness around the world.

We heard this week Prime Minister Maliki indicating that our soldiers 
could leave. He ultimately said he was misinterpreted. But, frankly, I 
believe, Mr. Speaker, it is time for our soldiers to be redeployed out 
of Iraq and that an appropriate and directed decision needs to move all 
of our soldiers home to America.
