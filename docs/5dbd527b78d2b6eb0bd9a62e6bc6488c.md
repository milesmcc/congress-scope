# IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING BILL
## `5dbd527b78d2b6eb0bd9a62e6bc6488c`
`Mr. McDERMOTT â€” 22 March 2007`

---


Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, those elected to serve in the people's 
House sometimes must decide matters of war and peace, in other words, 
matters of life and death, and nothing is more important.

Today we stand at the crossroads of one such momentous decision, and 
let


no one doubt that the lives of American soldiers and Iraqi civilians 
hang in the balance.

This is a vote of conscience and one of the most important votes I 
will ever cast in the House of Representatives.

I wish we were debating the language of the 1970 McGovern-Hatfield 
amendment. It called for directing funds only for the safe and orderly 
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Indochina. I enter into the Record at 
this point the Iraq version of the McGovern-Hatfield that I want to 
offer.

Proposed McDermott Amendment to H.R. 1591, Modeled on McGovern-Hatfield




 After April 30, 2007, funds herein appropriated may be 


 expended in connection with the activities of American Armed 


 Forces in or over Iraq, Iran or Syria bordering Iraq only to 


 accomplish the following objectives:



 (1) the orderly termination of military operations and the 


 safe and systematic withdrawal of remaining armed forces by 


 December 31, 2007 and



 (2) provision of humanitarian and reconstruction assistance 


 to the people of Iraq.
