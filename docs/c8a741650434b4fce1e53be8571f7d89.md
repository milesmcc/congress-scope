Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, moments before we opened this session, I 
had the privilege of witnessing a historic moment. Our distinguished 
Speaker, a lady who has just returned from a bipartisan visit to 
Kuwait, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, met the distinguished Speaker, 
another lady, another statesman, another political leader of 
outstanding qualities, the Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament.

When these two women met, Nancy Pelosi and Katalin Szili, history was 
made. We saw two great democratic republics, with parliaments headed by 
outstanding women, exchange views and plan the future of stronger and 
even better relations between the Republic of Hungary and the United 
States of America.

I salute Speaker Pelosi and Speaker of Parliament Katalin Szili and 
wish both of them the very best.
