Mr. GREGG. Madam President, obviously, I have an amendment which is 
caught up in this effort. I would hope we could vote on it. I think it 
is the right approach that we fund LIHEAP but that we also pay for that 
funding so we do not pass the bill for LIHEAP on to our children, so we 
do not put ourselves in a position where we are paying today's energy 
bills with our children's dollars 10 years from now, plus interest.

But I understand, having heard the majority leader come to the floor 
earlier and say he did not want this bill filibustered or slowed down, 
that this is sort of part of an exercise by the leaders of this bill on 
this bill--because this is the Indian health bill--to try to, I guess, 
clear the table so amendments which are not directly relevant to Indian 
health do not end up slowing down this bill.

I do not think this decision can be laid at the feet of either party. 
It appears it is a joint decision by the leadership of the committee of 
jurisdiction on Indian health. That is why this proposal, which Senator 
Sanders has laid out, which I am perfectly amenable to--and I would 
actually support the unanimous consent request that he propounded. It 
has been objected to.

I understand an amendment from our side dealing with the fact that 
the city of Berkeley has said the Marines there are unwelcome and has 
offered protesters a free parking site in front of the Marine 
recruiting headquarters, with a megaphone to yell at the marines--men 
and woman who have served us in war in Iraq--that proposal, which would 
have basically laid out the objection of the Senate to that despicable 
act by the city council in Berkeley relative to the treatment of our 
marines, is also not going to probably be offered because there is an 
attempt to move this bill forward.

I guess I appreciate the fact that the Indian health bill is a good--
I don't know if it is a good bill; I don't know enough about it, but it 
appears to be supported by both sides here, and they want to move it 
forward. It is unfortunate the LIHEAP issue, which I think should be 
addressed in the context I am proposing, which is that it be paid for, 
will not be able to be addressed at this time. But I understand the 
situation, and I understand why it has happened. But I do not think it 
can be laid at the feet of either party.
