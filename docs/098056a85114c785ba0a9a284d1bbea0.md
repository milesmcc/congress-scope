Mr. BIDEN. As I understand, the distinguished ranking member of the 
Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, suggested that instead of 
'' . . . Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary cause of 
increasing violence in Iraq,'' he wished the word ''increasing'' be 
struck from the language. It now reads: '' . . . settlement is the 
primary cause of violence in Iraq.''

So we have struck that. To the best of my knowledge, I say to my 
friend from Virginia, I think we have accommodated all the changes that 
were suggested.
