Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose the fiscal year 2008 Defense 
authorization bill because it authorizes $189.5 billion for the war in 
Iraq but does nothing to end the President's misguided, open-ended Iraq 
policy. That policy has overburdened our military, weakened our 
national security, diminished our international credibility, and cost 
the lives of thousands of brave American soldiers.

There are certain provisions of the bill that I support strongly, 
including a pay raise for military personnel, Senator Webb's amendment 
creating a Commission on Wartime Contracting to examine waste, fraud, 
and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Senator Lautenberg's amendment 
to create a Special Investigator General for Afghanistan 
Reconstruction.

But on balance, I cannot vote to support a bill that defies the will 
of so many Wisconsinites--and so many Americans--by allowing the 
President to continue one of the worst foreign policy mistakes in the 
history of our Nation.
