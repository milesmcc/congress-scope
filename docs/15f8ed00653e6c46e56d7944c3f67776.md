# LEVIN-REED AMENDMENT
## `15f8ed00653e6c46e56d7944c3f67776`
`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 13 July 2007`

---


Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate has now had a full day to 
debate the Levin amendment. The questions I raised about it yesterday 
remain unanswered. Americans need to know what they are being asked to 
consider. The troops fighting al-Qaida in Iraq also need to know. I 
will ask my questions again.

The Levin amendment says the Secretary of Defense shall ''commence 
the reduction of the number of United States forces in Iraq not later 
than 120 days after the date of enactment of this act.'' What would 
this reduction involve? The Levin amendment calls for U.S. forces in 
Iraq to have a limited presence after the reduction. What is a 
''limited presence''? The Levin amendment says our Armed Forces should 
only be used to protect U.S. personnel, to train Iraqis to fight, and 
to engage in ''targeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida.'' 
What does ''targeted'' mean? The Levin amendment says the Secretary of 
Defense shall complete the transition of U.S. forces in Iraq to a 
limited presence and missions by April 30. How does the author define 
''complete''?

A number of papers across America reported this morning that 
yesterday's House vote means that most U.S. troops will be out of Iraq 
by April. I ask the authors of the Levin amendment, is this true?

This 1/1/2/-page amendment is the centerpiece of the Democratic 
leadership's strategy for Iraq. They want us to choose this over the 
Petraeus plan. Listen to General Petraeus. Just before we began this 
debate, he made a simple request. He said:




 I can think of few commanders in history who wouldn't have 


 wanted more troops, more time, or more unity among their 


 partners. However, if I could only have one thing at this 


 point in Iraq, it would be more time.


Our Democratic-led Senate voted 81 to nothing to send General 
Petraeus into Iraq. A bipartisan majority of 80 Senators told him in 
May that he had until September to report back on progress. His 
strategy has led to what even skeptics describe as an encouraging 
turnaround against al-Qaida in Anbar, a province which accounts for


about one-third of Iraq's territory. Yesterday, just 1 month after this 
strategy became fully manned, Democrats are declaring it a failure and 
asking us to rally behind a 1/1/2/-page alternative that raises more 
questions, frankly, than it answers.

We have been down this road before. When the President decided to 
change course in Iraq last year, Democrats said his new strategy 
wouldn't work. They called it a failure before it began. Now just 1 
month after that strategy became fully manned, they are calling it a 
failure again, even as it has started to show signs of military 
success.

The Iraq Foreign Minister told us what would happen if America walks 
away from this fight right now: a sharp increase in violence, thousands 
of civilian deaths, and a regional conflict that could involve several 
other countries in that area. Yet the Democratic leadership has yet to 
address the consequences of withdrawal. Here is their response to 
concerns about a victory by al-Qaida, genocide, and a regional war in 
the Middle East: Blame Bush. That may work on the stump, but it is not 
a very sophisticated foreign policy, and it is not going to solve the 
great problems we face in Iraq and in the broader Middle East.

Fortunately, many brave people are facing this problem head-on. Our 
top commander in Iraq says he can win this fight. He told us he 
wouldn't risk a single American life if he didn't think he could. All 
he is asking for is time. Can we at least give him what we agreed to in 
May?

This amendment is not a responsible alternative to the Petraeus plan. 
It is a page and a half of vague proposals.

Now, look, all of us are frustrated with the war, but we have 
committed to listen to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. We did 
so through legislation. We need to listen to our top commander in the 
field. He deserves 60 days. More than 160,000 American soldiers and 
marines are fighting in Iraq right now. They believe in this mission. 
They are executing the plan, and they have a leader. He is asking for 
more time. Let's be fair and honor the legislation we passed in May. 
Let's wait for the report.

I yield the floor.
