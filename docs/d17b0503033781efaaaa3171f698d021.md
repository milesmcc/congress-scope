Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. My remarks will be confined to the 
importance of the point of order and its germaneness.

Director of National Intelligence McConnell recently said in 
testimony to this House that we are actually missing a significant 
portion of what we should be getting. That is true not only in Iraq and 
Afghanistan but for the war on terror in its whole.

This is critical to the security of this country.
