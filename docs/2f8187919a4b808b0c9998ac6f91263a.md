Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, this morning I come to the floor of 
this House to honor Army Sergeant Chris Davis. Sergeant Davis died 
Saturday defending liberty in Iraq. Serving in the United States Army 
was a life-long dream for Sergeant Davis. His 8 years in the Army 
included four tours of duty in Iraq. His devotion to America's security 
earned him numerous medals for his achievement, service and defense of 
his country.

A native of Lubbock, Texas, Chris was a brave soldier, a devoted 
husband and a loving father. This morning, my thoughts and prayers go 
out to his family: His parents, Ray and Hermina, his three sisters, his 
wife, Debbie, the children, Kasey, Blade, Jacob, Taylor and Dillon.

As we celebrate this Fourth of July week, may we remember the 
sacrifices of many that have gone before us and particularly this young 
brave soldier, Sergeant Davis from Lubbock, Texas.
