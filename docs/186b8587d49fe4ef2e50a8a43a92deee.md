Ms. SOLIS. Last November, the American people demanded a dramatic 
change at home and abroad. Now in the majority, Democrats in Congress 
are delivering on that promise. With the State of the Union address to 
be held tonight, President Bush can demonstrate that he has listened to 
the American public and is ready to work with the Congress on these 
priorities. On critical issues from Iraq to energy independence, it is 
time to take America in a new direction.

On security and Iraq. President Bush likes to make promises in the 
State of the Union addresses, he just doesn't always keep those 
promises. The President has promised the American people to strengthen 
America's security. Unfortunately, his policies have made the world 
more dangerous and America less safe. Now he wants to escalate the war 
in Iraq over the overwhelming opposition of the American public and 
many of his own generals. Unfortunately, President Bush's plan to 
escalate the war in Iraq will not bring success in Iraq or make America 
safer. It will receive an up-or-down vote in both chambers of Congress. 
We will always put our troops first, and that means holding the 
President accountable for those changes that he wants to provide.

Democrats have a plan for success that will make America safer and 
bring our troops home. Shifting the principal mission of our forces 
from combat to training, logistics, force protection and activities to 
counter terrorism; beginning the phased deployment of our forces in the 
income tax 4 to 6 months; and implementing an aggressive diplomatic 
strategy both within the region and beyond to help the Iraqis achieve a 
sustainable political settlement, including amending their 
constitution.

On economic security. Last November, the American people demanded 
real results to improve their everyday lives and strengthen middle-
class families. Today, President Bush has the opportunity to talk about 
a change of action there and work in a bipartisan way with those of us 
that are here serving in the House.

In its first 100 hours, the House of Representatives succeeded in 
passing legislation to raise the minimum wage, expand Federal funding 
for stem cell research, implement recommendations of the bipartisan 9/
11 Commission, require negotiations for lower prescription drug costs, 
make college more affordable for many, many families, and end subsidies 
for Big Oil to invest in clean renewable energy. These 100-hour bills 
are just the beginning. The new Congress will do more to take America 
in a new direction.

On health care. President Bush's health insurance proposal is a tax 
hike on the middle class of our country. It will do little to help the 
uninsured and will undermine the health insurance of those lucky enough 
to have it already. In the same year that President Bush is once again 
submitting a budget making his tax cuts permanent--tax cuts that go 
overwhelmingly to the richest Americans--he is proposing to shift more 
of the cost of health care onto working families. Under President 
Bush's leadership, the Nation's health insurance crisis has actually 
worsened, costs are up and the number of uninsured Americans has grown. 
This latest proposal is another step in the wrong direction.

On energy independence. Key to our national security and our economic 
security is energy independence. Last year in the State of the Union 
address by the President, he declared that we were addicted to oil. One 
week later in his annual budget, he shortchanged the development of 
alternative fuels and technologies needed to make America energy 
independent. As you know, Democrats are already putting America on a 
path to energy independence by cutting huge subsidies to Big Oil and 
investing in the alternative fuels and technologies needed to protect 
our national security, our economy and our environment. The science of 
global warming and its impact is overwhelming, as you know. The 
American public understands the urgency of the problem. We want to work 
with President Bush in a bipartisan fashion but we can't wait for him 
to put science before special interests.

Democrats will listen to what President Bush has to say today and we 
hope he will listen to the American public. It is time for all of us to 
work together for a new direction for all Americans.
