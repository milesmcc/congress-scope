Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.

This is the conclusion of Senator Webb's statement:




 The consequences of a failed U.S. national strategy should 


 be raised at a far higher level than General Casey's in Iraq.



 Mr. President, I urge my esteemed colleagues to support 


 General Casey's nomination to be the next Chief of Staff of 


 the U.S. Army.
