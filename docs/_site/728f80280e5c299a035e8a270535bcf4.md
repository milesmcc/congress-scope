Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, this House last night, about 11:30 p.m., 
authorized money for some absurd projects, including the study of bison 
hunting on the prehistoric Great Plains and, get this, the study of the 
sex lives of the Phayre's Leaf monkeys.

Meanwhile, our troops in Iraq are running out of money to fight the 
bad guys. Why? Because some Members of Congress think they know more 
about conducting the war in Iraq than the Generals do. So this 
congressional surrender group refuses to send more money without also 
demanding the day the United States will retreat and quit the fight.



This Nation is at war with the people of hate. Those ill-informed 
people who are determined that we lose this conflict by keeping a tight 
fist on the war money have their priorities wrong.

Money for the study of monkey business, but no money for the troops 
is a mockery. Money for our troops is more important than investigating 
the sex lives of the Leaf monkeys and the study of prehistoric bison 
anyplace in the world.

Mr. Speaker, we need to work as late tonight to provide money for our 
U.S. warriors as we did last night to send money to the monkeys.

And that's just the way it is.
