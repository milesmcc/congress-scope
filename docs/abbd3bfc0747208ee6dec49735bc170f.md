Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, September 8, 2010, Southern 
Indiana lost another of its brave sons. Marine Corporal John Bishop was 
killed in Helmand Province, Afghanistan after sustaining wounds from 
enemy small arms fire. He was 25 years old, and born in Batesville, IN.

Cpl. Bishop wanted to be a Marine from a very young age. After 
graduating from Southwestern Shelby High School in 2003, he immediately 
enlisted in the Corps. After joining he and his brother, Tyson, also a 
Marine, would often taunt each other as to who was the ''tougher'' 
Marine.

It was in the Marines that John met his wife, Cristle. The two were 
recently married and expecting their first child together, a daughter, 
next month. After his tour in Afghanistan--his third combat tour 
already having served twice in Iraq--Bishop planned to separate from 
the Marines, go to college to become a conservation officer, and start 
a life with his new wife and daughter, and his son K-Sean. Bishop's 
mother described her son as being ecstatic about starting a new chapter 
in his life. Sadly, that dream was cut short.

Cpl. John Bishop is the epitome of a true American hero. He and his 
family's sacrifice deserve our most sincere and heartfelt gratitude. 
Though I did not have the pleasure of meeting Cpl. Bishop, I mourn his 
death. His loved ones are in my prayers.
