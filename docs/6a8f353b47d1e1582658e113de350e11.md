Mr. LEVIN. We are going to move to the Iraq legislation immediately 
after the disposition of the Dorgan amendment, subject to the Cornyn 
amendment, which will be next which is being figured out in a UC. We 
are then going to go to the Iraq legislation, the Levin-Reed 
legislation, so I cannot tell the Senator from Vermont how long the 
debate on that legislation is going to last. There are many people who 
wish to be recognized thereafter, and I cannot at this time tell him 
which one from our side will be the one to be selected. I don't want to 
make that choice now.
