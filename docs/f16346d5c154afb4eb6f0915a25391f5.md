## `f16346d5c154afb4eb6f0915a25391f5`
`Mr. STARK â€” 18 October 2007`

Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.

I hope that we can find, as we close today and we come to this vote, 
enough people on both sides of the aisle who will vote to override the 
veto. It doesn't make much sense. There is no cost, there are no 
illegal aliens, there are no rich people, unless the Republicans choose 
to make it possible for them. It's a bill that is paid for, unlike the 
war, which the Republicans don't mention.

What are you going to do for that 200 or 300 billion bucks, folks, 
that you're spending to kill these kids when they grow up? You can't 
answer that, can you? You look at your shoes, look up here, you don't 
know.

So you don't even want to talk about $200 or $300 billion to kill 
innocent Iraqis and young men and women. There is no Member of this 
House that has an enlisted child over there. There is no risk for you 
guys.
