Ms. WATSON. Thank you very much, Chairman Lantos. And thank you, 
Chairman Skelton, for crafting this resolution and giving us the 
opportunity to discuss the war. And I want to thank our Speaker, Nancy 
Pelosi, who has been steadfast in moving this Congress and this country 
towards an honorable exit from our occupation of Iraq.

We are now 6 months into President Bush's vaunted escalation of the 
war in Iraq, and we are not seeing progress. Recently, the Washington 
Post reported that U.S. military commanders are increasingly relying on 
Sunni militias to fight insurgent groups. Our military officers are 
giving these militias weapons and intelligence and setting them loose.

Mr. Speaker, just a few months ago, the President told us he needed 
to escalate the commitment of the United States soldiers to Iraq to 
disarm ethnic militia. Now, we are arming them? Just a few months ago, 
the President told us that ethnic militias were undermining the 
security and stability of Iraq. Now, they are the guarantors of the 
stability and security of Iraq?

When the President's strategy for victory involves arming the people 
who, just a few months ago, were our sworn enemies, it becomes 
difficult for any of us to explain to our constituents what our troops 
are still doing there in Iraq.

The troops have done their job, and in an honorable way, but they 
will not be successful if the President cannot decide what the mission 
really is. And I remember him several years ago saying ''mission 
accomplished.'' I am sure we will hear from a number of people here 
that we need to give the escalation more time, that we need to wait 
until September. I'm not willing to do that, Mr. Speaker. I'm not 
willing to explain to the families of the soldiers who will die between 
now and September that it took an extra 3 months to figure out the 
President's plan, and there has been no strategy given to us for 
success.
