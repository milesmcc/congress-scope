# RECOGNIZING ECHO COMPANY OF 100TH BATTALION OF THE 442D INFANTRY
## `7bb6aa7e5a9bf67062e746b79e5f4da0`
`Mr. SABLAN â€” 7 December 2009`

Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, our Nation can never say ''thank you'' too 
frequently to the men and women who put their own lives at risk in 
military service. So I rise today as the sponsor of House Concurrent 
Resolution 199 thanking the men and women of Company E, 100th 
Battalion, 442nd Infantry Regiment for their service, their dedication, 
and their sacrifice.

I ask that the House adopt House Concurrent Resolution 199 honoring 
Company E--Echo Company, as we call it in the Northern Mariana 
Islands--in this year, the 10th anniversary of this distinguished band 
of soldiers. This year also marks the completion of Echo Company's 
second tour of duty in Iraq where they have distinguished themselves 
for their fortitude and bravery, always living up to the company motto, 
''Go for broke.''

I appreciate the support of the distinguished gentlelady from Guam 
and the other 25 members of the House Armed Services Committee who are 
cosponsors of House Concurrent Resolution 199. I also want to thank the 
additional 29 Members of this House from both sides of the aisle, 
including my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from Florida, who 
stepped up to say ''thank you'' to Echo Company.

Most of all, I want to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member 
McKeon for their leadership and their commitment to our men and women 
in uniform and for working with me to bring this resolution to the 
floor today.

As the first person to have the honor to represent the people of the 
Northern Mariana Islands here in Congress, one of my duties, I believe, 
is to educate this House about the people I represent. One 
distinguishing trait of the people of the Northern Mariana Islands is 
our devotion to the United States of America. We're unique, I believe, 
in modern times to have chosen as a society to become a permanent part 
of the United States. We could have become an independent nation, but 
instead, we chose to be part of this Nation.

Perhaps nothing exemplifies our commitment to serve our new Nation 
more than our participation in military service. Thirty percent of our 
graduating class from our public high schools enlisted in military 
service this year. And obviously, of course, with this out-of-
proportion participation in our military, there is an out-of-proportion 
level of risk. Our community, our small community of some 65,000 
people, has suffered the loss of 12 of our people in military service 
since the commencement of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is 
certainly one of the highest per capita rates of death in service of 
any community in our Nation.

I would like to read their names and honor them today: Army Sergeant 
Yihjya ''Eddie'' L. Chen; Army Sergeant Jesse J. Castro; Marine Lance 
Corporal Adam Q. Emul; Army Specialist Leeroy A. Camacho; Army Private 
First Class John D. Flores; Army Private First Class Victor M. 
Fontanilla; Army Specialist Joe G. Charfauros, Jr.; Navy Seaman 
Anamarie San Nicholas Camacho; Senior Airman Audra P.M. Winkfield; and, 
finally, the three members of Echo Company who gave their lives in 
combat for their country: Army Staff Sergeant Wilgene T. Lieto, Army 
Specialist Derence W. Jack, and Army Staff Sergeant Julian F. Manglona.



Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to say that by honoring 
specific individuals or a specific unit of the military, we in no way 
are forgetting all the men and women from communities all across our 
Nation who serve in the armed services. There are, in fact, many people 
from the Northern Mariana Islands who are not members of Echo Company 
in service throughout the world today. My prayers go out to them today 
and my thanks.

But Echo Company is the only unit from the Northern Mariana Islands 
composed solely of people from the Northern Mariana Islands and a 
platoon from Guam. So as the Representative of the Northern Mariana 
Islands and especially because this is the 10th anniversary of Echo 
Company in the Northern Mariana Islands, it is my honor and 
responsibility to take the floor and say ''thank you.''

Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize and am honored to have 
Representative and Senator-elect Ralph Torres of the Northern Mariana 
Legislature in the gallery today. Mr. Torres is here to join me in 
paying respect to our troops.

I would like to submit this letter of support from Representative and 
Senator-elect Ralph M. Torres into the Record.

 Hon. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,


 House of Representatives,


 Washington, DC.



 Dear Representative Sablan: I am proud and honored to write 


 this letter of support for H. Con. Res. 199, the concurrent 


 congressional resolution recognizing the outstanding efforts 


 of Company E, 100th Battalion, 442 Infantry Regiment for 


 their second deployment to Iraq; and to recognize




 their 10th Anniversary of being located on the Commonwealth 


 of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).



 As a current Representative and Senator-Elect in the CNMI 


 Legislature, I appreciate your efforts to honor the 


 dedication of our troops, and for recognizing the commitment 


 and challenges the spouses and families face when their loved 


 ones are deployed.



 Company E not only preserves our freedoms, but is a 


 valuable part of our community. They participate in many 


 community events, such as every July 4th as part of Island 


 Liberation Day, provide all funeral details on the CNMI and 


 participate in the Go for Broke baseball and canoeing teams.



 Go for Broke is the motto of Company E, and they live that 


 way in all they do and I am proud to support H. Con. Res. 


 199.





 Sincerely,


























 Ralph Torres,
















 Representative and Senator-Elect.


Godspeed to Company E, to all our men and women for your sacrifice 
and for all that you have done for our people and for the United States 
of America.
