Ms. COLLINS. It was a very illuminating trip with other Senators. It 
has shaped my views on the issues before the Senate.

One American commander in Baghdad told me a jobs program would do 
more good than additional American troops in quelling the sectarian 
violence. He told me many Iraqi men were joining the militias or 
planting roadside bombs simply because they had been unemployed for so 
long they were desperate for money and would do anything to support 
their families. This was an American commander who told me this.

Prime Minister Maliki, in mid-December, made very clear he did not 
welcome the presence of additional American troops and, indeed, that he 
chafed at the restrictions on his control of the Iraqi troops. So I 
didn't hear it from Iraqi leaders, either.

The only place where I heard a request for more troops was in Anbar 
Province where the situation, as we have discussed, is totally 
different than the sectarian violence plaguing Baghdad.
