Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I thank the gentleman. On Friday, what we said 
was no more blank checks, no more war without a strategy and a plan to 
get our men and women in uniform home, no more sending troops over into 
combat, into harm's way without the armor they need, without the 
preparation they need, without the rest they need. All of those items 
were in that Iraq War supplemental.

The alternative, what the President preferred, was just give me the 
money, just give me the money; do not ask me any questions. He was 
opposed to his own benchmarks. The benchmarks that he laid out on 
January 10 were in the bill, the ones that he said the Iraqi people 
have to meet, that the Iraqi leadership has to meet, and we added some 
that said, you know what, you have to make sure that you think about 
protecting the men and women we are sending over there.
