`Mr. OBAMA â€” 22 January 2008`

---

 Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wrote to Secretary Rice on 
September 11, 2007, out of concern for Iraq's Christian and other non-
Muslim religious minorities who appear to be targeted by Sunni, Shiite, 
and Kurdish militants. The severe violations of religious freedom faced 
by members of these indigenous communities, and their potential 
extinction from their ancient homeland, is deeply alarming in light of 
our mission to bring freedom to the Iraqi people.

In addition, such violence may be an indicator of greater sectarian 
violence. Such rising violence and the Iraqi internally displaced 
people and refugee crises potentially could serve as catalysts for 
wider regional instability. These crises demand an urgent response from 
our Government.

On January 11, 2008, I received a response from the Department of 
State to the questions I posed in my letter. I ask to have my original 
letter and the response from the Department of State printed in the 
Congressional Record.
