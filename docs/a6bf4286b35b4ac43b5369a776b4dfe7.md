Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate NAVSYS 
Corporation for receiving the 2007 Tibbetts Award given in recognition 
of the successful Talon NAMATH Program. The Tibbetts Award, named for 
Roland Tibbetts, honors organizations, individuals, and small 
businesses who demonstrate achievement in the area of Small Business 
Innovation Research.

Located in my hometown of Colorado Springs, NAVSYS Corporation was 
founded in 1986 by Dr. Allison Brown. Since its inception, this company 
has sought to promote the use of Global Positioning System in a variety 
of applications, both commercial and military. The Talon NAMATH Program 
for which


NAVSYS received the Tibbetts Award has provided crucial support to our 
military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I am proud to represent such an accomplished business and hope that 
this achievement by NAVSYS inspires other businesses in my district. 
Today, I offer my congratulations to NAVSYS and all those who worked so 
diligently on the Talon NAMATH Program. It is innovations by companies 
like this that will keep our country secure.
