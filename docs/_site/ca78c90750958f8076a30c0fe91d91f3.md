Mr. KAGEN. The reality is that it takes doctors and nurses to get 
into the room to get health care done. If you don't have a doctor and a 
nurse in the room, you don't have health care. And to get a child into 
a room, you need a parent. That is why in Wisconsin, by expanding in 
this State grant money, the State of Wisconsin sought to increase the 
enrollment of those children who are eligible, and thereby they covered 
the mother of these children who are close to poverty. By mothers being 
covered, the enrollment went up. It went up because they brought their 
children in.

I have practiced medicine for over 30 years, and I will tell you, I 
never saw a kid in the office unless the mother or one of the 
caregivers was there. So if you are going to get a child to a doctor, 
you have to include, in my opinion, the parent.

But this overarching theme is really about values. When the President 
vetoed this bill, it was a reflection of his values. And how you and 
your homes spend your money, your hard-earned money, is a reflection of 
your family values. How our Nation spends its money is a reflection of 
our national values. And there I come back to the $3.50 a day for a 
child and the $400 million a day making war and occupying Iraq.
