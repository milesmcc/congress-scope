`Mr. DODD â€” 17 May 2007`

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of 
myself and good friend, Senator Gordon Smith, the United States 
Commitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007.

This bill seeks to drastically reduce child and maternal mortality 
rates abroad. It is a goal entirely within our reach, relying on tools 
that are already within our grasp. We have the power to save millions 
of innocent lives; and there is no better measure for the success of 
our foreign aid.

The legislation would perform three simple yet vital functions. 
First, it would require the administration to develop and implement a 
strategy to improve the health of, and reduce mortality rates among, 
newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries.

Second, it would establish a task force to monitor and evaluate the 
progress of the relevant departments and agencies of our Government in 
meeting by 2015 the U.N. Millennium Development Goals related to 
reducing mortality rates for mothers and for children under 5.

Third, it would authorize appropriations for programs that improve 
the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. 
Specifically, it would increase funding for child survival programs 
from the current level of around $350 million to $600 million in fiscal 
year 2008, $900 million in fiscal year 2009, $1.2 billion in fiscal 
year 2010, and up to $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2011-2012.

I know that some of my colleagues will dispute the wisdom of such a 
large investment. None of them would deny this issue's importance; but 
some may question its priority. How can we answer them?

In a world of seemingly intractable problems, we have here an 
opportunity for quick and uncomplicated success. Each dollar we spend 
in this cause helps to save a vulnerable life.

And what is more, we have already given our word. As part of the 
Millennium Development Goals, the United States made an explicit 
commitment, along with 188 other countries, to reducing child and 
maternal mortality. But at current funding levels, we are set to renege 
on that promise by a wide margin.

On September 14, 2005, President Bush stated that the United States 
is ''committed to the Millennium Development Goals.'' I commend the 
President for his words, but they have not been matched with action.

As we reach the goals' halfway mark, the world's progress is 
distressingly slow. The leading medical journal The Lancet reports 
that, of the 60 countries accounting for 90 percent of child


deaths, ''only 7 are on track to meet the goal for reducing child 
mortality, 39 are making some progress, and 14 are cause for serious 
concern.''

Now what does that mean in real, human terms? It means each year over 
10 million children under the age of 5 die in the developing world, 
that's approximately 30,000 each day. About 4 million of those children 
die in their first 4 weeks of life. In many cases, they aren't even 
provided with a fighting chance. Preventable or treatable diseases such 
as measles, tetanus, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria are the most 
common causes of death.

Similarly, more than 525,000 women die from causes related to 
pregnancy and childbirth, more than 1,400 each day. Some of the most 
common risk factors for maternal death include early pregnancy and 
childbirth, closely spaced births, infectious diseases, malnutrition, 
and complications during childbirth.

Nearly every one of those deaths is entirely preventable. And that 
fact makes a poor American commitment inexcusable.

That commitment will not require new medicine. It will not require 
sophisticated technology. The tools we need are already at hand. Even 
now, simple measures are saving lives in the developing world.

Studies in the Lancet tell us that, for just over $5 billion, the 
world could prevent two-thirds of under-5 child deaths with proven, 
low-cost, high-impact interventions. For 6 million lives, that is a 
bargain.

How cheap are these lifesaving measures? Oral rehydration therapy for 
diarrhea costs 6 cents per treatment. Antibiotics to treat respiratory 
infections cost a quarter per treatment. Encouraging breastfeeding, 
providing vitamin supplements and immunizations, and expanding basic 
clinical care are just as cost effective.

This bill incrementally scales up U.S. funding for child and maternal 
health programs up to $1.6 billion by 2011. That is a third of the 
money the world needs to save those 6 million children's lives, and it 
is proportionate to our efforts against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. And 
it is less money than we spend in Iraq in just 1 week. Yes, 1 week.

To be clear, America is not new to this battle. We've had some 
significant successes: Between 1960 and 1990, U.S. investment in 
reducing child mortality in the developing world contributed to a 50 
percent reduction in under-5 deaths. Over the past 20 years, we have 
devoted over $6 billion to child survival programs.

But as I have noted, at current funding levels in the U.S. and 
abroad, the world will not meet the Millennium Development Goals. 
Certainly, America cannot meet them alone. But with a strong effort, we 
can galvanize other nations to do their part and come forward with the 
funds we need to save lives.

So I am proud to offer the Global Child Survival Act of 2007, a bill 
with widespread, bipartisan, bicameral support. It has been endorsed by 
Save the Children, the US Fund for UNICEF, and the One Campaign; is 
being jointly introduced with my good friend Senator Gordon Smith from 
across the aisle; and was introduced last week in the House in a 
bipartisan manner by Congresswoman Betty McCollum and Congressman Chris 
Shays.

For me it's simple. As the world's only superpower and largest 
economy, the United States is in a unique position to tackle the 
toughest challenges of our times. Where we can make a concrete 
difference, we must not fail to act. Where we have the tools to 
alleviate death and suffering, we must deliver them.

So I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Millions of lives are 
in the balance.

I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
