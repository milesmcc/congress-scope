Ms. FALLIN. Madam Speaker, Congress must immediately send our troops 
the resources that they need to win this war, without strings and 
without delay. But instead, the Democrat leadership is proposing to tie 
the hands of our troops and hamstring our generals with a misguided 
plan to micromanage the war effort. This is just unacceptable.

The Los Angeles Times has said, ''It's absurd to try and micromanage 
this conflict and the evolution of Iraqi society with arbitrary time 
lines and benchmarks.'' And I agree.

It is absurd to assume that this war can be planned by 535 Members of 
Congress instead of our generals and our Commander in Chief. War by 
committee is not an option. I encourage the Democrat leadership of 
Congress to bring forth immediately a clean bill that provides the 
necessary funds for our troops and leaves tactical decisions in the 
hands of our generals and those who are experts.
