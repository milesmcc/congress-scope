Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank the chairman and thank the chairman of 
the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee who has put this together.

My colleagues, a short while ago when President Bush was asked how 
long will this war last, he said: ''We will be in Iraq as long as the 
Iraqi people want us there.''

Well, this bill says that we will be in Iraq as long as the American 
people want us there. And the American people realize this is a war 
that is not worthy of the sacrifice of those men and women in uniform 
who are bearing the whole cost of this war.

This bill is about that young son who was told by his daddy one day 
that he has to leave him to go off and fight for our country. And day 
after day he asks his mommy: When is daddy coming back? And finally one 
day his mommy, with tear-filled eyes, has to say: Daddy is not coming 
back.

Well, we have to ask ourselves: Is this war worthy of that sacrifice? 
This bill says it is not because there has never been a strategy for 
success. This bill will bring our troops home as soon and as safely as 
possible.
