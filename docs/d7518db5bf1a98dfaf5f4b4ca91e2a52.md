Mr. REID. Madam President, following leader time, there will be a 
period of morning business for Senators, and they will be able to speak 
for up to 10 minutes each. There are no votes today, but this is going 
to be a very busy week. We have a certain number of things we have to 
do.

We are going to do as many circuit judges as we can. We will 
certainly at least do one. We have the budget conference report we have 
to complete. We hope to go to that on Thursday at about 4 o'clock. And, 
of course, the big one we have to do is the supplemental appropriations 
bill regarding the war funding in Iraq. Those things we have to 
complete before we leave here. The budget and the supplemental we have 
to finish before we leave.

As I indicated, we are going to have some things here on Wednesday in 
the Capitol regarding President Johnson. From 11 until 12 noon on 
Wednesday, there will be a time set aside on the Senate floor for 
tributes to the former President on the centennial of his birth.
