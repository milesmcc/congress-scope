Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, today is Tax Day, April 15, 
and that's why the Democrats have risen today to be able to tell the 
American people we're on your side. The Taxpayer Assistance and 
Simplification Act of 2008 may cost $22 million, but I can assure you 
that it pales in comparison to the money that my friends are spending 
on the unending war in Iraq.

I am glad to stand with the taxpayers of America, making sure that 
the elderly and the disabled are exempted from liability for employment 
taxes or payments to home care service providers. They deserve our 
respect, and today we give it to them.

I am glad that we are requiring a written notice to taxpayers of the 
eligibility of the earned income tax credit. It's a shame that so many 
think that there is so much fraud for hardworking Americans who don't 
file for their taxes who deserve it, and I'm delighted to stand with 
Americans to repeal the authority of the IRS to enter into private debt 
collection, those guys who have harassed the elderly, the shut-ins, 
hardworking Americans because they are private bounty hunters.

Today we stand with hardworking Americans. We will do so as well. And 
we honor our troops, declare the war's end, bring them home and 
reinvest in America.
