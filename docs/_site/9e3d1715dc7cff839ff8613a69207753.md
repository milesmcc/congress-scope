`Mr. YARMUTH â€” 14 June 2007`

Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, it appears that the House Republicans are


operating from the same playbook as President Bush.

Over the first 5 months of this year, this new Democratic Congress 
has approved more than 45 key measures, most of them with strong 
bipartisan support. Unfortunately, President Bush has been a stubborn 
opponent of our efforts to move this Nation in a new direction. He 
opposes or has threatened to veto 60 percent of the House's work.

The President threatened to veto a Defense authorization bill because 
he believed it gave our brave soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan 
too big a pay raise. His administration opposes a bill that would make 
college more affordable by cutting student interest rates in half. And 
he has once again threatened to veto legislation promoting life-saving 
embryonic stem cell research.

While the President has been obstructing our agenda for months, House 
Republicans have jumped on the bandwagon and are now delaying critical 
appropriations bills. Rather than obstructing the process, Republicans 
should join us in passing bills that will help us better secure the 
homeland and better serve our veterans.
