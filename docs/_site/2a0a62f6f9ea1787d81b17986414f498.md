Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to congratulate 
the House for moving on the issue of Iraqi translators. I am talking 
about translators who have worked for the American Armed Forces in 
Iraq. They have to follow a very detailed procedure, and then they get 
certified. Most of them have to work on it for more than a year.

These people have been particularly targeted by the terrorists. Their 
names are printed in mosques and other places of worship, and if they 
are found, they are executed. We have a limitation, I believe, of 50, 
and we have taken in 18. Many of these individuals have risked their 
lives for American service men and women and this legislation will be a 
very small downpayment in terms of their safety and their security. It 
is important, and I am hopeful we will be able to address this issue.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.
