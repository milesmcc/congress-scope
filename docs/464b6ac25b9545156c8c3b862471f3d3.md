Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation before us today 
because I believe it represents a safe and responsible way to bring our 
troops home from Iraq. The President has had more than four years to 
demonstrate leadership in Iraq, but at every turn his decisions have 
dragged us deeper into an ethnic and sectarian crisis that the 
President seems incapable of solving. Eleven months ago, the bipartisan 
Iraq Study Group released its report, which offered a comprehensive 
plan to build up the Iraqi government and create the political and 
security stability needed to bring our troops home. Unfortunately, the 
President rejected this bipartisan approach and instead implemented his 
troop surge. As a result, 2007 was the deadliest year for our troops 
since the beginning of the war, and we are no closer to a political 
solution to the problems in Iraq than we were when the troop surge 
began. Because the President refuses to take responsibility for his 
failed strategy, I believe it is time for Congress to act.

The legislation before us today provides our troops with the funding 
and equipment they need to safely do their job. This includes funding 
for our continued efforts to provide security and support for the 
government of Afghanistan. However, it is a far cry from the blank 
check that the President requested. It requires the President to begin 
redeploying troops out of Iraq within 30 days of enactment, and sets a 
goal for total redeployment by December 15, 2008. The bill also 
requires the President to undertake diplomatic efforts designed to 
engage other regional and international actors in providing for a 
secure Iraq. It includes important provisions that ensure the first 
troops sent home are the ones who have served in Iraq the longest, and 
that no more troops can be sent to Iraq unless they have all of the 
equipment and training that they need.

I had hoped that this bill would also include funding to address the 
growing refugee crisis in Iraq. While I am disappointed this issue is 
not being addressed today, I have been assured that Congress will act 
soon to assist the millions of Iraqis who have been displaced because 
of sectarian fighting.

This legislation is not perfect, but I believe that it is worth 
supporting because it will require the President to do something he has 
so far refused to do: explain to the public how he plans to get our 
troops out of Iraq. In fact, this bill would make it clear to the 
President that he will not get one more dime from Congress until his 
redeployment plan has been submitted. I applaud Chairman Obey for 
staying true to his pledge to send the President an Iraq spending bill 
with accountability and timelines built in. I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation because it represents an important first step 
towards holding the President accountable and safely bringing our 
troops home from Iraq.
