`Mr. NEUGEBAUER â€” 23 January 2007`

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, I rise today and I am proud to follow 
my good friend from Texas, Mr. Johnson, and support his bill, H.R. 511, 
to say to those men and women across the world that are defending 
freedom and democracy on our behalf, we will not let you down; we will 
support you.

One of the things that there is a lot of debate in this House on and 
will be is about whether our mission is the right mission or not. But 
let there be no mistake that we cannot fail in our mission, and we 
cannot afford for our young men and women to ever doubt that this 
United States Congress will support them.

Also, I rise to honor today a great American, Roy Velez, Jr., who 
will be my guest tonight for the President's State of the Union 
message. Roy paid the ultimate price for our country in that he gave 
two sons to our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Madam Speaker, we cannot let our men and women have any doubt of our 
support, nor can we let their families doubt the support of this 
Congress.

So I rise in support and encourage all of my colleagues to support 
H.R. 511, to say to the men and women and our troops, thank you, God 
bless you, and we will support you.
