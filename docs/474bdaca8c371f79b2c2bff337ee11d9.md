`Mr. UDALL of New Mexico â€” 29 June 2010`

---


Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to join my 
colleagues as we mourn the death and celebrate the life of a man who 
touched all of ours; a man who loved his country, loved the Senate, and 
dedicated his life to preserving its traditions; a man who above all 
cherished his State and who every day considered it his highest honor 
to represent her people.

On Monday morning, Senator Robert Byrd took his rightful place in our 
history books as a titan of the Senate. On Thursday we will honor him 
as his body lies in state in this Chamber where he served longer than 
any other Senator in our history. Today, we grieve his loss with his 
family and with the entire country.

My family's history with Senator Byrd goes back many years. My 
father, before he became Secretary of the Interior, served with Senator 
Byrd, then Congressman Byrd, in the House of Representatives. A half 
century later, my father's honor became my own. I am proud to have had 
the privilege of serving in this Chamber with Senator Byrd, of 
experiencing firsthand his distinguished service and remarkable career.

Senator Byrd will be remembered for many things. He will be 
remembered for his historic length of service; for his rise from humble 
roots to the pinnacles of political power; for his encyclopedic 
knowledge of Senate rules and procedure; and for his love of his wife 
of 68 years, Erma.

What I will remember Senator Byrd for is his willingness to stand up 
and fight for what he believed in. Two of the most pressing issues of 
the past decade are perfect examples--the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
From the very beginning, Senator Byrd was a voice of opposition to the 
Iraq war. He delivered what will become one of his most memorable 
speeches in the days leading up to the Senate's vote to authorize its 
funding. He spoke out against a war at a time when any opposition to 
the President's path meant putting his own political future in 
jeopardy. But he did not waiver.

Here is part of what he said:




 No one supports Saddam Hussein. If he were to disappear 


 tomorrow, no one would shed a tear around the world. I would 


 not. My handkerchief would remain dry. But the principle of 


 one government deciding to eliminate another government, 


 using force to do so, and taking that action in spite of 


 world disapproval is a very disquieting thing. I am concerned 


 that it has the effect of destabilizing the world community 


 of nations. I am concerned that it fosters a climate of 


 suspicion and mistrust in U.S. relations with other nations. 


 The United States is not a rogue nation, given to unilateral 


 action in the face of worldwide opprobrium.


Eight years and thousands of American lives lost later, his words 
read as prophetic.

But he didn't stop there. Last year--this time with his party holding 
the reins of power in both the White House and the Congress--he did the 
same thing. Seven years had passed, and Senator Byrd was older and more 
fragile than ever before. None of that stopped him from getting to the 
Senate floor that day. How did I know this? I had a front row seat as 
the presiding officer of the Senate that day.

This time, he questioned the proposed buildup of troops in 
Afghanistan--a proposal I myself had questioned many times as well. 
Here is what Senator Byrd said:




 I have become deeply concerned that in the 8 years since 


 the September 11 attacks, the reason for the U.S. military 


 mission in Afghanistan has become lost, consumed in some 


 broader scheme of nation-building which has clouded our 


 purpose and obscured our reasoning.


He continued:




 . . . President Obama and the Congress must reassess and 


 refocus on our original and most important objective--namely 


 emasculating a terrorist network that has proved its ability 


 to inflict harm on the United States.


Time will tell if Senator Byrd's concerns about Afghanistan prove as 
prescient as those he expressed about Iraq almost a decade ago. Time 
also will tell if we heed those concerns.

What is clear is that Senator Byrd understood the importance of 
asking the tough questions, regardless of their impact on himself 
personally or professionally. In this regard, we could all learn a 
little bit from Senator Byrd.

I know my Senate colleagues will agree with me when I say this 
institution, this country, this democracy lost a powerful advocate this 
week, and all of us in this Chamber lost a good friend.

Today I join with my colleagues in expressing my deepest sympathy to 
Senator Byrd's family for their loss and remembering a man whose legend 
and legacy will endure beyond us all.
