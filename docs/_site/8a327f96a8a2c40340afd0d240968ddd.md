`Mr. BAYH â€” 20 September 2010`

---


Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Corporal 
John C. Bishop of the U.S. Marine Corps and Versailles, IN.

Corporal Bishop was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marine 
Regiment, 2nd Marine Division. He lost his life on September 8, 2010, 
while serving bravely in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 
Helmand province, Afghanistan. He was serving his third tour of duty 
and was 25 years old.

John graduated from Southwestern Shelby High School in 2003 and 
immediately joined the Marines. John aspired to become a marine from a 
young age, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his older brother 
Tyson. Tyson joined the Marines in 1993, and each time he returned 
home, John would climb into his older brother's Marine uniform.

Today, I join John's family and friends in mourning his tragic death. 
He is survived by his wife Cristle Bishop, who is expecting their first 
daughter in October; his son K'Sean Bishop; his mother Sarah Thomas; 
his brothers William Bishop, Mike Bishop, Anthony Thomas, Eric Thomas, 
Jamey Bishop, and Tyson Bishop; and his sisters Nancy Braley and Amy 
Parker.

As we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we take pride in 
the example of this American hero. We cherish the legacy of his service 
and his life.

As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall 
President Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: 
''We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this 
ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have 
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world 
will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never 
forget what they did here.''

It is my sad duty to enter the name of CPL John C. Bishop in the 
official Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and 
for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.











Staff Sergeant Phillip Chad Jenkins


Mr. President, I also rise today to honor the life of SSG Phillip 
Chad Jenkins of the U.S. Army and Decatur, IN.

Staff Sergeant Jenkins was assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 27th 
Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. He was only 26 years old 
when he lost his life on September 7, 2010, while bravely serving 
during his second tour of duty in support of Operation New Dawn in 
Balad, Iraq. Staff Sergeant Jenkins' first tour was in support of 
Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

A Decatur native, Staff Sergeant Jenkins graduated from Bellmont High 
School in 2002 and joined the army soon after. While in high school, 
Staff Sergeant Jenkins enjoyed playing the saxophone in the school band 
and worked at Scott's Food & Pharmacy.

Staff Sergeant Jenkins was a dedicated soldier who always went above 
and beyond the call of duty. One of his fellow soldiers, Fritz 
Bultemeyer, described Staff Sergeant Jenkins as ''a great American 
fallen hero.''

Today, I join Staff Sergeant Jenkins' family and friends in mourning 
his death. He is survived by his wife Melissa; his two daughters Piper 
and Lindly; his mother and father Rose and David Jenkins; and his 
sister Cassie Jenkins.

We take pride in the example of this dedicated soldier and great 
American hero, even as we struggle to express our grief over this loss. 
We cherish the legacy of his service and his life.

As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall 
President Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: 
''We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this 
ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have 
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world 
will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never 
forget what they did here.''

It is my sad duty to enter the name of SSG Phillip Chad Jenkins in 
the official Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country 
and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.
