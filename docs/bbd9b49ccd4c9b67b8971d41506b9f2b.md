Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I would like to thank my colleague, Mrs. 
Tauscher, for her leadership on this committee and on this issue. When 
I went to Congress, I never thought that I would be deploying troops or 
welcoming caskets back to my congressional district. What I am learning 
is most of the young men and women who get killed in Iraq are on their 
second or third or fourth tour. Clearly it must indicate that they need 
some rest and down time.

I am here to say I understand, Mr. Leadership in the military, you 
think you know what you are doing, but I am telling you I sit with 
mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and aunts and uncles who 
have lost people in the military. If all it takes to help them save 
their lives is to give them some rest, give them some rest.

Does it need to be mandated? Apparently so. Let's mandate it. Let's 
give our young men and women the time they need, down time, to be able 
to do a good job. I support your resolution and am glad to stand up 
with you.
