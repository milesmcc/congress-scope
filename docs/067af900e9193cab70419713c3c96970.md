Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

I rise in support of House Resolution 1644, a bill expressing the 
support of the House of Representatives for the designation of a 
National Veterans History Week.

On October 27, 2000, Public Law 106-380 was signed by President 
William Jefferson Clinton to establish the Veterans History Project. 
The legislation before us supports the designation of a National 
Veterans History Project Week, recognizes National Veterans Awareness 
Week, and calls on the people of the United States to interview at 
least one veteran in their families or communities according to 
guidelines provided by the Veterans History Project, and encourages 
local, State and national organizations along with Federal, State, city 
and county governmental institutions to participate in support of the 
effort to document, preserve, and honor the service of United States 
wartime veterans.

The Veterans History Project is maintained by the American Folklife 
Center in the Library of Congress. It collects, preserves, and makes 
accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that 
future generations may hear directly from veterans and better 
understand the realities of war.

The collection features firsthand accounts of U.S. veterans who 
served in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, 
the Persian Gulf War from 1990-1995, or Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts, 
2001 to present.

It also contains the accounts of U.S. citizen civilians who actively 
supported war efforts such as war industry workers, USO workers, flight 
instructors, medical volunteers, defense contractors, and so on. 
Citizens can participate by obtaining a field kit from the Library of 
Congress which contains the tools necessary to conduct interviews or 
help veterans with the interview process.

Several Members of Congress have already participated in interviews 
relating to their military service. I am one of them. Other Members are 
Cliff Stearns, the deputy ranking member of the committee, who reported 
his experience as an Air Force captain during the Vietnam War; and 
Ranking Republican Steve Buyer , who recorded his experiences during 
the Persian Gulf War in Iraq.

Again, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 1644, and just to 
thank the gentleman. We had the Traveling Vietnam Wall in my hometown 
of Johnson City, Tennessee, a little over a year, a year and a half 
ago. We had thousands of people come by. I was able to participate 
myself as a veteran. We got hundreds of stories from during the Vietnam 
War.

In a small church in Sevierville, Tennessee, a small Baptist church, 
15 young men went off to World War II and three did not return. I asked 
them to record this history for their church and for their community.

My history professor in college, Dr. Preston Hubbard, wrote a book 
''Apocalypse Undone,'' recounting his capture in the Philippines, the 
Death March, and time as a slave laborer in Japan for 4 years, an 
incredible account.

I spoke recently to a 96-year-old veteran at the Mountain Home VA 
Medical Center in Johnson City about his experience before there was 
World War II when the U-boats wolf pack were sinking our ships taking 
supplies to England. He flew missions to bomb those before there was a 
war. I looked at his record and that part was inked out. That is a 
history that would have been lost without this.

My own father-in-law flew combat missions in Burma supporting 
Merrill's Marauders during World War II.

I was in a Hardees one morning campaigning, shaking hands. I sat down 
to talk to two gentlemen, and who did I talk to but two veterans who 
had survived the Battle of the Bulge, and they shared their stories 
with me.

One veteran in the same county the very same day had won a Silver 
Star after having a severe head injury. And I asked him how he was 
doing. He said he was cutting back on his farming a little bit; he was 
87 years old. That is the generation that built this Nation. To lose 
those histories, and I agree with you completely, how many times have 
we heard, I wish I had taken a note of it, I talked to someone who 
served and gotten their story.

It is not all, most of us veterans won't share everything we did. I 
want to make that clear, too, for the House tonight. There are some 
things that probably just need to be left unsaid. But those stories 
have meant a lot to me and my family, and I would encourage now that we 
have an opportunity for all veterans who can and are able to and are 
willing to, to share these stories and document them. They are very 
important, because as was stated, we are losing 1,500 to 1,700 World 
War II veterans per day.

I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for this resolution.

I yield back the balance of my time.
