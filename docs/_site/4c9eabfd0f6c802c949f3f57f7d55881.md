Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as part of our ongoing efforts to end 
the war in Iraq, H.R. 400 is an important step in standing up against 
those who defraud our troops or improperly profit at the expense of our 
troops. We must be vigilant in prosecuting war profiteers, using every 
tool available. The President should use his legal authority to cancel 
contracts with those that defraud the government and be aggressive in 
seeking to recover lost funds. If he is unwilling to do so, Congress 
will hold him accountable.
