Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Iraq defeat bill that this House has passed 
sets the day certain that American troops will leave Iraq. By doing so, 
Congress is trying to legislate ''defeat day'' no matter the 
consequences.

In other words, retreat, retreat, at any price, retreat. Quit, quit, 
at any price, quit. Withdraw, withdraw, at any price, withdraw. Flee, 
flee, at any price, flee. Surrender, surrender, at any price surrender.

Congress has changed the phrase, ''when the going gets tough, send in 
the U.S. Cavalry, send in the U.S. Marines,'' to, ''when the going gets 
tough, leave,'' leave in the darkness of the night and let the Iraqis 
go it alone.

I am sure there is joy in ''Desertville'' in the fanatical minds of 
the enemies of freedom. Mr. Speaker, war is hard. This war is hard. But 
we cannot neglect our duty because it is hard.

The stability of the region and our national security depend on our 
U.S. success in defeating the enemy. We need to make it hard on them. 
Give them a day to remember.

And that's just the way it is.
