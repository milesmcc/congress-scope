`Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas â€” 6 May 2008`

---


Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. May 1, just last Thursday, was the fifth 
anniversary of the famous words, ''Mission Accomplished.'' What a 
tragedy, when April was the most deadliest month in Iraq that we have 
seen in a number of months.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the administration to recognize 
that this unending war must end. And in the backdrop of a newspaper 
article that suggests that the administration is looking at a $500 
million development of hotels and restaurants and amusement parks in 
Baghdad, I ask the administration, do they get it? That's why it's 
important for us to support an amendment in the emergency supplemental 
that says we will bring our troops home with honor. This will go into 
effect one month after this legislation is passed.

Seven months, deadliest, April, troops dying. This kind of war cannot 
be an unending war. And so we refuse to give more blank checks to Iraq. 
We thank our soldiers on the front lines of Iraq and Afghanistan, the 
war we should win. Bring our troops home with honor. Vote for this 
amendment. And let's not focus on a $500 million development of hotels 
and restaurants in Iraq--what are we thinking about?--Let's bring the 
troops home!
