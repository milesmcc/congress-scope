`Mr. BAYH â€” 26 April 2007`

---


Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of 
gratitude that I honor the life of a brave young man from Munster. 
Shaun Blue, 25 years old, died on April 16 while deployed in Al Anbar 
Province on Operation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, 
Shaun risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to 
our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.

Shaun was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating among the top 10 students of 
his class from Munster High School in 2000. He joined the military 
because, as his high school principal said, ''He was one of those kids 
who did things everyone else was afraid to do.'' His valor over the 
course of his service in Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage. 
His track and field coach at Munster High described Shaun as a mentally 
tough kid saying, ''The fact that he chose the career path that he did 
didn't surprise me. It was perfectly suited for him.''

Shaun was killed by an improvised explosive device while serving his 
country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a member of the 2nd 
Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine 
Expeditionary Force, based in Twenty-nine Palms, CA.

Today, I join Shaun's family and friends in mourning his death. While 
we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride 
in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer 
place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will 
remember when they think of Shaun, a memory that will burn brightly 
during these continuing days of conflict and grief.

Shaun was known for his dedication to his community and his love of 
country. Today and always, Shaun will be remembered by family members, 
friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the 
sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.

As I search for words to do justice in honoring Shaun's sacrifice, I 
am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families 
of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:




 We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow 


 this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled 


 here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or 


 detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we 


 say here, but it can never forget what they did here. This 


 statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years 


 ago, as I am certain that the impact of Shaun's actions will 


 live on far longer that any record of these words.

It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shaun M. Blue in the official 
Record of the Senate for his service to this country and for his 
profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think 
about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain 
that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like 
Shaun's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, 
''He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away 
tears from off all faces.''

May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be 
with all of you, as I know He is with Shaun.










 Private First Class David Neil Simmons


Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude 
that I honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo. Neil Simmons, 
20 years old, was killed on April 8th while deployed in Baghdad, when 
his convoy encountered an improvised explosive device and insurgent 
fire. He had been in Iraq for less than 2 weeks. With his entire life 
before him, Neil risked everything to fight for the values Americans 
hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.

Neil attended Kokomo's Northwestern High School and followed the 
example set by his father and uncle by enlisting in the Army a few 
months before graduating in 2005. He enjoyed the structure of the 
military and felt a sense of duty to serve his community and country. 
His father described Neil as ''an avid outdoorsman who was happy and 
always had plenty of friends.''

Neil was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade 
Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, in Fort Benning, GA. Neil's father 
reflected on his son's death, asking, ''What's the odds of, among 
160,000 troops your only child is there 1 week and gets killed?'' 
Private First Class Simmons leaves behind his father, David, and uncle, 
Jim Simmons.

Today, I join Neil's family and friends in mourning his death. While 
we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride 
in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer 
place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will 
remember when they think of Neil, a memory that will burn brightly 
during these continuing days of conflict and grief.

Neil was known for his dedication to his family and his love of 
country. Today and always, Neil will be remembered by family members, 
friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the 
sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.

As I search for words to do justice in honoring Neil's sacrifice, I 
am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families 
of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:




 We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow 


 this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled

May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be 
with all of you, as I know He is with Neil.













Specialist Jason J. Beadles


Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude 
that I honor the life of a brave young man from La Porte. Jason 
Beadles, 22 years old, died on April 11th while deployed in Baghdad on 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, Jason risked 
everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, 
in a land halfway around the world.

Jason has been a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from La Porte High 
School in 2003. He had been interested in technical engineering 
throughout high school, earning his welding certificate from A.K. Smith 
Career Center before graduating. Army Specialist Beadles enlisted in 
the Army as an engineer after the attacks of 9/11. His valor over the 
course of his service in Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage. 
He decided to enlist because as his welding instructor put it, ''he was 
always concerned about other people.'' Jason enjoyed the military, and 
he believed that throughout all the hardships they faced he and his 
company were helping the Iraqi people.

Jason died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He 
was a member of the 887th Engineer Company, 326th Engineer Battalion, 
101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), in Fort Campbell, KY.

Today, I join Jason's family and friends in mourning his death. While 
we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride 
in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer 
place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will 
remember when they think of Jason, a memory that will burn brightly 
during these continuing days of conflict and grief.



Jason was known for his dedication to his community and his love of 
country. Today and always, Jason will be remembered by family members,

Private First Class Richard P. Langenbrunner


Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude 
that I honor the life of a brave young man from Fort Wayne. Richard 
Langenbrunner, 19 years old, was killed on April 17 while deployed in 
Rustamiyah, Iraq. With his entire life before him, Richard risked 
everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, 
in a land halfway around the world.

Richard was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from Northrop High School 
in 2006. He completed basic training this past January and was deployed 
just a few weeks later. He is remembered for his love of people, life, 
and adventure. ''He was so happy and excited about his future before he 
graduated,'' said a former classmate. ''He joined the military because 
he wanted to drive a tanker.'' Richard enlisted in the Army just before 
graduating high school. His valor over the course of his service in 
Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage.

Richard died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He 
was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 
3rd Infantry Division, stationed in Fort Benning, Georgia.

Today, I join Richard's family and friends in mourning his death. 
While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take

 Staff Sergeant Bradley D. King


Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude 
that I honor the life of a brave young man from Gas City. Bradley King, 
28 years old, was killed on April 2 while deployed in Al Amiriyah, 
Iraq, when a roadside bomb exploded near his Humvee. With his entire 
life before him, Bradley risked everything to fight for the values 
Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.

Bradley attended Mississinewa High School, enlisting in the National 
Guard in 1997, a year before his graduation in 1998. Bradley enjoyed 
the military and felt a sense of duty to serve his community and 
country. The day before he was deployed, Bradley told his mother that 
he felt ''called to serve in the military for his country.'' His aunt 
described Bradley as ''a responsible young man determined to do his 
best for the people he loved.''

Bradley was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 152nd Infantry Regiment, 
76th Infantry Brigade, Marion, IN. Master Sergeant Bill Wallen, King's 
supervisor, told local media, ''he was a heck of a human being, he's 
what everybody else needs to be in this world.'' Staff Sergeant King 
leaves behind his wife Adrian and 15-month-old son, Daethan.

Today, I join Bradley's family and friends in mourning his death. 
While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take 
pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer 
place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will 
remember when they think of Bradley, a memory that will burn brightly 
during these continuing days of conflict and grief.

Bradley was known for his dedication to his family and his love of 
country. Today and always, Bradley will be remembered by family 
members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we 
honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.

As I search for words to do justice in honoring Bradley's sacrifice, 
I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the 
families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:




 We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow 


 this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled

 Specialist Cody A. Putman


Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude 
that I honor the life of a brave young man from Lafayette. Cody Putman, 
22 years old, was killed on April 11th while deployed in Baghdad on 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, Cody risked 
everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, 
in a land halfway around the world.

Cody was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from Twin Lakes High School 
in 2003. He is remembered for his love of


people, life, and adventure. ''He was someone who was always looking to 
have a good time with others,'' said a former teacher. ''He joined the 
military because of the teamwork.'' Cody enlisted in the Army after 
high school, and his valor over the course of his service in Iraq 
exemplifies Hoosier values and courage. A month before he died, Cody 
had been home on leave for 2 weeks vacationing with his family in 
Florida. Cody is survived by his father, Harry Putman, and his mother, 
Pam Mow. He also leaves behind his wife, Molly Putnam, 20, and 3-year-
old daughter Madelyn.

Cody died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He 
was a member of the 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade 
Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, based in Fort Richardson, AK.

Today, I join Cody's family and friends in mourning his death. While
