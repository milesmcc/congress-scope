Mr. WEXLER. Thank you, Mr. Lantos.

Mr. Speaker, today I stand with the American people in support of 
this resolution and in opposition to the President's escalation of the 
Iraq war. I stand in opposition to a President that failed the American 
people by initiating an ill-conceived war; an administration that 
misled the Nation, vulnerable after 9/11, into believing that Saddam 
Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; an administration that 
invented links between Baghdad and al Qaeda; that ignored the views of 
the intelligence community, while convincing Americans that our brave 
soldiers would be greeted in Iraq as liberators; an administration that 
assured us that Iraqi oil money would pay for the reconstruction; and 
that through military force, rather than diplomacy, we would cultivate 
American values of freedom and democracy in Iraq.

The American people know that they have been taken down a false path 
by this administration, down a spiraling path of war under false 
pretenses into a quagmire with a President who will not change course, 
even in the face of a growing civil war. This resolution sends the 
President an unequivocal message that he must change direction of this 
war.

How did we arrive in this desperate situation? From the top down, the 
President, the Vice-President and the Secretary of State have 
manipulated evidence, broadcast half truths, and doctored intelligence 
through an orchestrated effort to smear and destroy those who have 
opposed their policies. Just last week, in a scathing report, the 
Defense Department's Inspector General concluded that the Pentagon took 
inappropriate action by advancing conclusions that were not backed up 
by the intelligence community.

The American people have judged the actions of this President, they 
see this war for what it is, and they spoke clearly in November, 
stating loudly that we must end our disastrous Iraq policy. Yet this 
administration continues its defiant disregard of the views of the 
American people. Not the voice of the American people nor the 
conclusions of the Iraq Study Group have


budged this administration from its stubborn and misguided path. And 
now, the President is doubling down on a bad bet that risks the lives 
of thousands more American soldiers on a misguided plan that ignores 
the recommendations of our military commanders on the ground.



Unbelievably, President Bush has already tried twice the strategy of 
escalation. It failed both times. To try again is to act in blind 
faith, ignoring the facts, ignoring the experts, ignoring the will of 
the American people, and, worst of all, ignoring the terrible 
sacrifices that will undoubtedly be endured by our soldiers and their 
families.

Mr. Speaker, our troops must be redeployed from Iraq. Instead of a 
surge of American troops entering Baghdad, there should be a surge of 
American soldiers back into every town and every city across our 
Nation. For our troops who have given so much in Iraq, for our military 
families whose lives have been shattered by this war, it is time to 
bring them home.

How do we honor our brave men and women? How do we honor over the 
3,000 who died, and thousands more who have been maimed? Instead of an 
escalation, we should honor these soldiers by bringing them home and 
giving them the best health care, the best mental health support that 
they have justly earned.

I applaud Congress for taking a stand on this war. I only wish we 
were voting on a binding resolution that mandates a redeployment of 
troops and cuts off funding for this tragic escalation. Each month we 
remain in Iraq, 100 more American soldiers die, hundreds more are 
maimed, and $5.5 billion is spent.

Mr. Speaker, we have endured 4 years of a failed Iraq policy, longer 
than we were in World War II, longer than we were in the Korean War, 
and we can afford no more blank checks for this President.

Today I stand with the American people, our soldiers in Iraq, with my 
fellow Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle in strong 
opposition to the President's escalation in Iraq and in support of our 
redeploying our troops and reversing, most importantly, our Nation's 
failed strategy in Iraq.
