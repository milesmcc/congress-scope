Ms. HOOLEY. Madam Speaker, I am here today in this hallowed hall with 
a heavy heart and troubled spirit.

Here, but a few hours ago, we assembled in keeping with an annual 
ritual that proclaimed our Union to be strong, our nation to be sound.

Sadly, I must contest that notion.

We are not as strong as we could be, as we should be, we are not what 
we would be without Private First Class Ryan Hill.

For this past week, Private Hill was killed in Baghdad, Iraq. As a 
member of the 1st Infantry Division, he and his unit were performing 
duties in keeping with our efforts to foster peace and stability.

America lost someone special when we lost Ryan. He represented the 
better angels of our nature, he was the kind of young American we need 
more, not less.

Immediately following high school, Private First Class Hill joined 
the military to fight for his country, his community--to fight for his 
family and friends.

Far too often we find ourselves standing here, recognizing the loss 
of heroes.

Private Hill died while on patrol. Using an improvised explosive 
device--a weapon without honor, without conscience--our enemies stole 
from us the America that would have been.

Right now, the community of Keizer, Oregon is seeking comfort in the 
life and noble sacrifice of Ryan Hill.

This we must do; he answered the call of service voluntarily and 
fulfilled his duty without hesitation, without complaint.

Private First Class Hill was a model soldier, he was the kind of 
young man that made everyone around him better.

In correspondence home, he recognized the dangers--he knew well the 
price of freedom--and yet he soldiered on despite his situation.

His enthusiasm and compassion made Ryan a beacon of hope for his 
comrades in arms in the shadow of the loss of several friends just a 
short time ago.

That shadow is now a little denser, a little darker--it reaches 
farther than before. And this shadow makes the future, our future, less 
than what it would have been.

I am here today asking us all to consider well the choices before us. 
We have an opportunity to ensure the life and death of Private Ryan 
Hill are not forgotten, that his sacrifice endures within our memory.

Let us recommit ourselves to making this Nation a place worthy of the 
gift Ryan Hill has given us; let us commit ourselves anew.
