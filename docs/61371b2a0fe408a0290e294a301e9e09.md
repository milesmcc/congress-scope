Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, over the recess I had the opportunity to 
have several public hearings back home, and Iraq was one on everyone's 
mind. The overwhelming consensus was that we need a new strategy in 
Iraq, a view shared by national security experts and illustrated by 
continued violence in the region. Today, we can chart a new path so 
that we can finally bring our troops home.

Americans know the Bush strategy isn't working, and today's Iraq 
status report confirms the lack of progress. The Iraqi Government has 
failed to promote political reconciliation, and our military is paying 
the price. Our troops have done a superb job, but they were not sent to 
Iraq to referee a civil war.

Today's bill requires our military to start redeploying out of Iraq 
within 120 days, to be completed by April 1, 2008. We will not abandon 
Iraq, but we must implement a new strategy based on political, economic 
and diplomatic initiatives.

I want to thank Chairman Skelton for his leadership on this measure, 
and I urge all my colleagues to support it.
