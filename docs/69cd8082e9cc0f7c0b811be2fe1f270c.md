Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, many in Congress and around this country 
insist that the President take the advice of The Iraq Study Group. 
Well, the President is doing just that. The report states, ''We could, 
however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat 
forces to stabilize Baghdad, or to speed up the training and equipping 
missions needed.''

Well, my colleagues, that is what the President is trying to do. The 
cochair of the study group, James Baker, had this to say: ''Setting a 
deadline for withdrawal regardless of conditions in Iraq makes even 
less sense today because there is evidence that the temporary surge is 
reducing the level of violence in Baghdad.''

Rather than support a bill that leaves our troops in harm's way for a 
cause Democrats believe cannot be won, Democratic leaders should be 
willing to vote to allow time to let the surge work and not signal 
defeat.
