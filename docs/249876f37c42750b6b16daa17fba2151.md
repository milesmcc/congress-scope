`Mr. DODD â€” 26 October 2007`

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have some comments I want to make about 
the FISA legislation. But before doing so, I commend my colleague from 
North Dakota. I have joined with him on so many occasions in the past. 
Once again, his eloquence and passion about these issues is evident 
this morning. We have worked together. We have sponsored legislation on 
a number of matters. I will join him in the efforts he raised today. He 
has described a situation that most Americans find horrific.

As to the point he makes on the issue of supporting our troops, I 
find it offensive that anyone would suggest, because we disagree with 
the policy, we are somehow putting our soldiers, sailors, marines, and 
airmen at risk. I strongly suggest, as does my colleague from North 
Dakota, that our continuing policy in Iraq has made us less safe, less 
secure, more vulnerable, more isolated in the world and, in fact, the 
very soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines we admire are in greater 
jeopardy because of a continuation of this policy. I will be joining 
with him and others as we try to bring this to a halt, not in 2009 or 
2013 but hopefully this year. I commend him for his comments.
