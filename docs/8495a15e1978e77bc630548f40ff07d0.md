# SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008

Mr. BOYD of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this bill was brought to the floor 
in a fiscally responsible manner. By fully funding this GI Bill for the 
next 10 years and paying for it up front, we have made this legislation 
better for our veterans and better for the American people.

We are asking those who benefit the most from living in a strong 
country to pay to take care of those who risk their lives to defend it 
instead of borrowing the money from China or bucking the costs to our 
children and grandchildren.

Supporting this bill is the right thing to do. And I want to thank 
Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha for also including the Iraq loan 
provisions which will require the Iraqis to pay for the security 
training of their own people and the reconstruction efforts.
