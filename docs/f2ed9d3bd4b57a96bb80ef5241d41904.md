Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, this is a straightforward amendment with a 
simple purpose: To ensure the video recording of each strategic 
intelligence interrogation of any person in the custody of the 
Department of Defense, except for personnel and troops in the field 
conducting battlefield interrogations. The video recordings would be 
kept at the appropriate level of classification and could be used to 
get maximum intelligence benefit of the interrogation, and the judge 
advocate general would develop guidelines for the recording and 
retaining of the recordings. I think it is important for our national 
security that we make this provision law.

I yield 2 minutes to an Iraq war veteran, a former officer in the 
Judge Advocate General Corps who understands this very well, the need 
for it, and will speak, Mr. Patrick Murphy from Pennsylvania.
