Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank Mr. Dee Cork for 
his years of service in the United States Armed Forces, and for his 
continued service to our country by building a memorial to veterans 
from Denton County, Texas.

Working along with Mr. Monty Slough, Mr. Cork identified the names of 
nine fallen service members and created a personal way to memorialize 
their service. Without prompting or financial support, Mr. Cork began 
building a granite tiled memorial to Denton County soldiers, sailors, 
airmen and marines who died in service in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Mr. Cork has taken up the honorable but unfortunate task of paying 
respect to fellow veterans who pay the ultimate price while serving our 
country. In his own eloquent words Dee said, ''It would be nice to see 
no one else on it, one is too many.''

The mobile memorial built by veterans Monty Slough and Dee Cork is an 
example of why we hold our nation's veterans in such high esteem. I 
believe the character displayed by Mr. Slough and Mr. Cork should be 
highlighted as an example of American civic duty and community support; 
I rise here today to show them that courtesy.

It is with great honor that I recognize Mr. Dee Cork for his 
dedication to veterans and their families. I thank him for his work, I 
support his mission, and I am honored to have the opportunity to 
recognize him today.
