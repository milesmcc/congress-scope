`Mr. KING of Iowa â€” 10 September 2007`

Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his 
delivery. And I reflect that General Petraeus' last part of his 
prepared testimony said, in closing, it remains an enormous privilege 
to soldier again in Iraq with America's new Greatest Generation. Our 
country's men and women in uniform have done a magnificent job in the 
most complex and challenging environment imaginable. All Americans 
should be very proud of their sons and daughters serving in Iraq today.

He also said that he believes that this is perhaps the most 
professional military to ever take to the field. And I recall a 
discussion that we had in Baghdad just about 5 or 6 weeks ago, and the 
statement was made that this is not only the most professional but the 
best military that's ever been put into the field, that's ever gone to 
war.

And one of the remarks they made, in addition to well-trained and 
brave and dedicated and well-equipped and patriotic and all of those 
adjectives that we use, one of the other ones was and the most 
perceptive. The most perceptive.

And that caught me off guard, Mr. Speaker. I didn't expect that. But 
I understood what that meant; to have the perception to know the 
difference on when to shoot and when not to shoot, when to be the 
ambassador and when to be the soldier. That's one of the hardest 
things, and sometimes a decision has to be made in a split second. And 
that's what they meant by the


most perceptive military to be sent off to war.

And again, much was said today, much will be said about today. But at 
this point, I'd be happy to yield as much time as he may consume to the 
chairman of the Policy Committee from Michigan, Mr. Thaddeus McCotter.
