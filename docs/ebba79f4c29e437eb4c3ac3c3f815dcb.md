`Mr. ISAKSON â€” 17 July 2007`

---


Mr. ISAKSON. Then, secondly, at the end of the article, I think a 
paragraph that all of us should hear: Lucy said the following:




 We're talking about boots on the ground, real people. When 


 I think about my son who could have done anything with his 


 life, but he fought because he believed in his country and 


 what we are doing in Iraq. . . . I just don't want it to have 


 been in vain.


Well, I want to say to Lucy Harris and the parents of every soldier 
and the loved ones of every soldier who has been deployed, and 
especially those whose lives have been lost, we don't want them to be 
in vain, nor do we want them to be deployed in an endless occupation. 
We have a benchmark going to September 15, a general who had the 
unanimous support of this body, and operating under a funding mechanism 
that received an 80-vote margin in May.

Let's end the quibbling at this moment on what we do and give the 
plan a chance to have its final merits judged and weighed by the man 
who is on the ground.

As I said at the outset of my remarks, I can completely respect the 
statements everybody made and the opinions of everybody here. But this 
is a very serious question. And we should vote, and will vote, tomorrow 
at 11. When we do, I will not vote for cloture because I want to 
continue the commitment that was made by this body in the middle of May 
on the funding of the Iraq supplemental, the timetable for reports to 
come back, and the conditions upon which we would change, a new way 
forward, if and only if, those benchmarks were not met and progress was 
not being weighed.

I think we owe it to Lucy Harris. We owe it to the legacy of the 
sacrifice her son made and the sacrifice made by the countless men and 
women who are in Iraq and those who have served before them.

I yield the floor.

 Senators Grapple With Iraq Policy













 (By Halimah Abdullah)




 For Rick and Lucy Harris and the small town of Ellijay, 


 Ga., the Iraq war isn't just some policy debate raging on the 


 floor of the U.S. Senate. It's about the frailty of life and




 the power of one young man's sacrifice to spur others into 


 action.



 First Lt. Noah Harris's death two years ago while serving 


 in Iraq brought the conflict home to that community. Now, the 


 Iraq war dominates conversations.



 ''It's the discussion in classes. It's the discussion in 


 town. Everyone is very interested in what is going on,'' said 


 Noah's mother, Lucy Harris.



 So it's with no small degree of annoyance that the Harris 


 family has watched the back and forth in the Senate over 


 changing Iraq war policy.



 ''They should just defer to Petraeus,'' Lucy Harris said of 


 Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of forces in Iraq. ''It's 


 a political game.''



 Republicans leaders such as Georgia Sens. Saxby Chambliss 


 and Johnny Isakson are in a tough position as they try to 


 assuage the concerns of people at home, like the Harris 


 family, while helping the GOP navigate the debate on funding 


 an increasingly unpopular war backed by a president whose 


 support is also on the wane.



 A recent Gallup poll showed President Bush's approval 


 rating at 29 percent, and 71 percent of Americans favoring a 


 proposal to remove almost all U.S. troops from Iraq by April 


 2008. The president's job approval rating in a recent AP-


 Ipsos was 33 percent.



 As Chambliss and Isakson consider changes to the Iraq war 


 policy they do so amid a climate of several high ranking 


 Senate Republican defections, Including that of Sen. Richard 


 lugar, R-Ind., the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign 


 Relations Committee. The departures have included Sen. John 


 Warner, R-Va., and the moderate-leaning Sen. Olympia Snowe, 


 R-Maine.



 For Republicans, the signs of strain are starting to show.



 ''It is Important for us to continue to pursue the goals of 


 the surge, and have a debate not in advance of the facts but 


 after we know the facts as they stand,'' Isakson said on the 


 Senate floor Wednesday.



 The White House has urged Republican lawmakers to wait 


 until Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, 


 gives a report on the war's progress in September before 


 voting on any major policy changes.



 While most Republican leaders have agreed to do this, 


 they've also acknowledged that congressional and public 


 patience for the war effort is growing thin.



 ''I think what's happening is that we've come to a critical 


 point,'' Isakson said,



 Jennifer Duffy, a political analyst and managing editor 


 with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, put it bluntly.



 ''There's just so many bullets for a lame duck president--


 especially an unpopular one, that (Republican leaders) can be 


 expected to take,'' she said.



 ''Georgia, like most of the South is still more supportive 


 of the war in Iraq than the rest of the nation,'' said 


 Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the 


 University of Georgia and author of the book ''The New 


 Politics of the Old South.''



 The Harris family and the folks in Ellijay could not care 


 less about the politics behind the war, or how Senate votes 


 and defections will impact politicians. As a community that 


 has watched their young people go off to war, they are 


 intensely interested in seeing just how military leaders will 


 define victory In Iraq.



 ''We're talking about boots on the ground, real people,'' 


 Harris said. ''When I think about my son who could have done 


 anything with his life, but he fought because he believed in 


 his country. In what we were doing in Iraq . . . I just don't 


 want it to be in vain.''



 That range of emotions surrounding military sacrifice isn't 


 lost on Chambliss and Isakson.



 Recently, Chambliss made sure a measure to provide wounded 


 soldiers better medical care was included in the defense 


 authorization bill currently being debated by Senate.



 Such efforts are welcome news to Harris, who often speaks 


 at public events about her son.



 ''My son's mantra was 'I do what I can,' '' she said, her 


 voice trailing off.
