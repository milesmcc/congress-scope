`Ms. CASTOR â€” 12 July 2007`

---


Ms. CASTOR. I thank the distinguished chair of the Rules Committee 
for yielding me this time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor of the Responsible Redeployment 
from Iraq Act under this rule, and urge my colleagues to pass it today, 
because in this summer of 2007, in the fifth year of the Bush-Cheney 
war in Iraq, it is imperative that we chart a new direction for our 
national security and be more strategic in the defense of America.

As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, it is clear to me 
that the reckless White House policy and now the escalation of the war 
is undermining our country's readiness and ability to respond to other 
global


threats to our national security. Indeed, in testimony before our 
committee, top commanders have testified that America runs a strategic 
risk by staying on the same course in Iraq.

The generals confirm that because our personnel and equipment are 
tied up in Iraq, our ability to handle future threats and contingencies 
is reduced. In my State of Florida, for example, the National Guard 
does not have all of the equipment it needs to train and deploy 
soldiers. They are only 28 percent equipped. In effect, President 
Bush's war in Iraq is impairing our country's ability to prepare for 
any other threat to our national security.

Florida also feels the pinch of multiple deployments because, time 
and again, our brave men and women are being asked to go back, to leave 
their families, leave their jobs, return to the field of battle after 
inadequate rest at home. Florida currently has the second highest 
number of troops out of the 50 States deployed in Iraq, over 23,000. 
And 172 Floridians have been killed and over 1,200 have been wounded 
since military operations began there over 4 years ago. Hardly a week 
goes by that my office is not contacted and informed of another sad but 
heroic death in this cause. In fact, last week, two more Tampa Bay area 
brave, heroic soldiers were killed by IEDs.

People ask me, why are our young American men and women refereeing 
the ongoing Shiite-Sunni civil war? American troops cannot resolve the 
Iraqi sectarian and religious conflict; only Iraqis can find the 
political resolution required to stabilize Iraq. America has now spent 
over $450 billion in Iraq. When will the Iraqi government take 
responsibility for the future of their country?

President Bush's war in Iraq has been very costly. Over $10 billion a 
month now, costly not just in terms of degradation of our Nation's 
readiness, the waste and fraud due to the lack of oversight, but 
President Bush is sacrificing the health care of our children and our 
seniors and investments in our towns and neighborhoods while continuing 
this war without end.

So after 4 years of war and over 3,500 American lives, and the Bush-
Cheney failure to aggressively pursue a political solution, we demand a 
new direction and a comprehensive strategy for our great Nation.
