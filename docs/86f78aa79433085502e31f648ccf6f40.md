Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Yes, just moved to Dubai. You would think that with 
all of the taxpayer money they get, they would at least stay in the 
country.

But all of this is not just coming out by coincidence.



There have been 104 hearings related to the Iraq War. Oversight and 
accountability. One of the key responsibilities of the United States 
Congress is to provide oversight to the executive branch agencies, and 
we did not hear about any of this stuff for 6 years when the Republican 
House and the Republican Senate sat on their hands while all of this 
was going on. This is not stuff that is on the news. This is not stuff 
that just happened. This is stuff that happened when the Republican 
Congress was in charge.

Now, I understand that we are all loyal to our political parties, but 
at some point, when it begins to hurt the American people, you need to 
provide the oversight of their tax money and the kind of inadequacy 
that has been going on in Iraq.

Now all of the sudden they want to change course. Now all of the 
sudden


the commander in the Middle East is running around saying that we do 
not have time. You know why they do not have time? Because we are 
putting the heat on them to get things done. 104 hearings on oversight. 
That is our responsibility.
