Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Armed Services 
Committee in the Senate to support this bipartisan bill in front of us 
that is critically important to our national security.

I applaud Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for their 
leadership in guiding this bill to the floor today. They have done a 
tremendous job. I also want to acknowledge the expert staff they have 
been ably supported by who serve on the committee the Acting President 
pro tempore and I are both so honored to be a part of.

I am particularly grateful to them for including provisions important 
for Colorado, including $560 million in authorized military 
construction.

I would like to highlight in particular the military construction 
dollars for Fort Carson, which is in the wonderful city of Colorado 
Springs and the County of El Paso. Millions of dollars have been 
allocated to Fort Carson for military construction projects to prepare 
to expand the post so it could house a 47th Brigade Combat Team, and 
millions more are in the pipeline for fiscal year 2010.

But the future of that funding was put in doubt when Defense 
Secretary Gates announced earlier this year that the Army would not 
create a new brigade combat team at Fort Carson.

I remain disappointed that brigade will not be coming to Fort Carson, 
at least in the near future. But I understand Secretary Gates's concern 
that we need to fill out the brigades we have, expand the amount of 
dwell time service members have between deployments, and meet readiness 
requirements before we create new brigades.

Still, I wanted to ensure that Fort Carson and the Colorado Springs 
community are not punished because of the Army's decision. Many of the 
soldiers at Fort Carson live and work in substandard buildings. They 
still need new barracks, mess halls, vehicle maintenance shops, and 
other infrastructure--even if that new brigade combat team will not be 
located there.

A number of faculties were scheduled to be replaced in future years 
anyway, so with the dollars we have kept in the bill, the 43rd Brigade 
Combat Team will get its updated facilities a few years early. I am 
pleased the committee worked with me to preserve the most important 
construction dollars at Fort Carson. This ensures the soldiers at Fort 
Carson will have the quality of life they deserve.

The bill also includes language I offered in the committee with 
Senator


Lieberman that studies the benefits and risks of reducing the planned 
number of BCTs from 48 to 45. The relationship between the number of 
brigades and dwell time and demands on specific military occupational 
specialties, so-called MOSs, is complicated. I want to make sure the 
reduction of BCTs results in the upsides we expect and does not present 
unforeseen problems or downsides.

Staying on the topic of what is important in the bill to Colorado, 
there is $246 million in funding to keep the cleanup of the Pueblo 
Chemical Depot on track. This will allow the destruction of weapons 
there and the cleanup at the depot to be completed by the 
congressionally mandated date of 2017. Significantly, the bill funds 
the disposal, onsite, of these hazardous wastes left after the chemical 
treatment of the mustard agent. I worked with the people of Pueblo to 
fight a proposal to ship this waste offsite, so I am glad the bill 
underscores the DOD's commitment to onsite disposal. It is the safest 
thing to do and makes the most sense.

Finally, in regards to Colorado, the committee approved an amendment 
I offered regarding reimbursement for health care providers, such as 
Pikes Peak Behavioral Health Group in Colorado Springs. This center, 
and many centers like it, want to help our soldiers and their families, 
but TRICARE--which is the civilian health care system for military 
personnel and their dependents--cannot keep up with the high costs of 
medical care, and sometimes providers are not reimbursed at all for 
their necessary services.

In particular, TRICARE providers are not reimbursed for providing 
case management services for soldiers with PTSD and traumatic brain 
injury, known as TBI. If we help these soldiers stay in treatment, if 
we make sure they get their medical appointments, and if we generally 
coordinate their care, we end up reducing costs, and we help those 
soldiers and their families who are facing these challenges with mental 
health function in their communities.

So this amendment directs the Defense Secretary to assess the 
efficacy and cost of case management services for those with serious 
mental health problems. My hope is the study will show the benefits of 
case management and then help further the DOD consider covering this 
important service under TRICARE.

If I might, let me turn to the broader legislation because it 
includes many provisions that do not directly relate to Colorado.

The bill supports our service members, and it keeps Americans safe. 
It authorizes $679 billion for defense programs, with $129 billion 
going to our ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

First and foremost, the bill focuses on our military's readiness 
needs. We need to do all we can to help make sure our men and women in 
uniform--who voluntarily put their lives on the line for us, and who 
have been stretched to the limit by repeated deployments--have the 
training, the equipment, and the facilities necessary.

To help our men and women in uniform support themselves and their 
families, the bill provides a 3.4-percent, across-the-board pay raise, 
as well as an extension of stop-loss pay for 2 more years. That is an 
important number.

Importantly, this bill gives Afghanistan the attention it deserves. I 
had the great privilege of traveling to that part of the world 
recently, and I think there is a window of opportunity to try to arrest 
deteriorating security conditions in both countries and to work with 
the civilian governments in Afghanistan and Pakistan to achieve 
stability and security in this all-important region.

This is not about ''staying the course.'' This is about finally 
committing resources and attention to an area that is a critical front 
in the war against Islamic extremism and correcting the mistakes and 
missteps of recent years.

That is what the bill would do. It would refocus our attention on 
this important region. It would protect our troops in harm's way by 
providing funds for MRAP all-terrain vehicles to be deployed in 
Afghanistan and additional Blackhawk helicopters to give mobility to 
our troops.

Our bill also supports the training and equipping of the Afghan 
Security Forces, as well as efforts to help the Pakistani Government 
understand and implement a counterinsurgency strategy on the part of 
their military forces.

Moreover, our bill cares for our wounded warriors. It expands TRICARE 
benefits for certain military retirees. It requires mental health 
assessments of service members prior to deployment, and it calls for an 
increase in the number of military and civilian behavioral health 
personnel.

We also include a comprehensive review of the activities of the 
Department of Defense for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of 
substance abuse disorders among service members. This is particularly 
important in light, today, of a report that has been released--the 
EPICON study--that directly focuses on Fort Carson.

This is a study that was initiated last year to examine the records 
of Fort Carson soldiers who have been involved in violent crimes since 
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army Surgeon General, 
Lieutenant General Schoomaker, put together a team of experts to 
identify any commonalities among the violent crimes.

I had a chance to sit down with General Schoomaker yesterday. He and 
his team have concluded that although risk factors alone do not explain 
a ''clustering'' of crime in the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 4th 
Infantry Division--the 4 of the 4--a combination of factors converged 
to increase the risk that these soldiers would be engaged in violent 
crime.

One concern General Schoomaker expressed was that the stigma and lack 
of referral to the Army Substance Referral Program for required 
substance abuse screening may have increased the overall risk of 
violent behavior. The general talked about the need to reduce barriers 
to treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, which is an Army-wide concern. 
He mentioned pilot projects ongoing at a number of posts where soldiers 
who ''self-identify'' a substance abuse problem can get treatment 
without the knowledge of their commanders, helping them seek treatment 
without fear of appearing weak in the eyes of their superiors. I will 
be urging the Army to establish a similar pilot program at Fort Carson.

Mr. President, let me turn to the bill and what is notable for what 
it does not include. There are policies that are difficult to change 
because they are antiquated and no longer reflect the reality of our 
society. The failed policy, ''don't ask, don't tell,'' is a good 
example. But the fact that it will be difficult to repeal does not mean 
we should not try.

Since the implementation of this program in 1993, the Armed Forces 
have discharged over 12,000 brave and qualified combat troops--code-
breakers, medical and intelligence specialists, and skilled 
translators--simply for being gay. This includes over 300 service 
personnel who have been discharged since President Obama took office.

Mr. President, this is 2009. I believe this discriminatory policy 
undermines the strength of our military and the fairness of our great 
Nation. We are engaged in two wars. It is counterproductive to 
discharge service members who have critical skills to winning these 
wars, even as the military has to spend scarce dollars to replace them. 
In my opinion, we need to bring the injustice of this policy to the 
forefront now, and I plan to work with my colleagues and with the 
administration to see that we accomplish, in a timely manner, the full 
repeal of ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''


There are things this bill doesn't include that it shouldn't include, 
such as spending on underperforming, unnecessary, and outdated weapons 
systems. It took courage for Secretary Gates to make the 
recommendations he did, since it is never easy to stop spending 
programs in our Defense budget. But we need to stop funding programs 
that significantly exceed their budget and we need to stop spending 
limited dollars to buy more capability than the Nation needs.

There are also provisions in this bill that shouldn't be included, 
such as additional spending on the F-22. I voted in committee against 
an amendment to add $1.75 billion to the bill to purchase F-22 aircraft 
that the military does not


want, does not need, and says we cannot afford. The F-22 is a valuable, 
capable aircraft, but the question is whether we need more than 187 F-
22s to meet the Nation's requirements, and there is bipartisan 
agreement that we do not. Presidents Obama and Bush, two Secretaries of 
Defense, three Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, and current members of the 
Joint Chiefs agreed that 187 aircraft are sufficient.

So let me conclude by saying that this is a good bill. It is a bill 
that balances the need to sustain our current war-fighting abilities 
with the need to prepare for the next threat to our national security. 
It is critical that we are able to meet the operational needs of our 
military today, even as we continue to prepare our men and women in 
uniform to be the best trained and equipped force in the world.

This is a good bill for our Nation and for my home State of Colorado; 
it is a carefully drafted and considered bipartisan bill, and I urge 
its passage.

I yield the floor.
