`Mr. SMITH of Nebraska â€” 8 February 2007`

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, it is with a deep sense of 
gratitude and a profound sense of sadness that I rise today to pay 
tribute to the life of a brave man from McCook, NE. Sgt Randy J. 
Matheny died on Sunday in Iraq in Baghdad by an improvised explosive 
device.

With his entire life in front of him, Randy chose to risk everything 
to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land 
halfway around the world.

My heart goes out to Randy's family. He was known as a dedicated 
spirit and for his love of our country. All Nebraskans will remember 
him as a true American. We can take pride in the example he set, 
bravely fighting to make the world a better place.

My thoughts and prayers go out to Randy's family and friends during 
this difficult time.

May God grant them strength, peace, and comfort.
