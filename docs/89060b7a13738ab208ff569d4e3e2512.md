Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, and Members, I am pleased that we have


taken time from our schedules to come to the floor tonight to sound the 
alarm. The saber rattling is going on by this administration. The 
remarks that we're hearing day in and day out are more accusatory 
toward Iran. We are made to believe that we are somehow being placed at 
a great threat by Iran.

And so we know where this is going. We know what this means, and 
we're saying, we must not rule out diplomacy. We must believe that we 
can settle differences by way of diplomacy.

We know that we've still got work to do on Iraq. We've still got to 
make many Members of this House feel comfortable with the idea that 
they can confront their President, that they can still be very, very 
patriotic as they stand up against war and bringing our soldiers home. 
We know that the work has to be done, but we've got to add to that work 
the fact that we can stop an airstrike on Iran and we can stop the 
notion that somehow we must send more soldiers in.
