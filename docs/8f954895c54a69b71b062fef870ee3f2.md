`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 15 May 2007`

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Let's look at what we are just trying to do. All 
we're saying is we're going to give the President, he wants $100 
billion and we're saying we want to give you $30-some billion, and then 
D.C. lingo, fence the rest of the money in, the other $50 or $60 
billion, until he comes back, the President comes back to us in July 
and is able to articulate to the United States Congress and the 
American people and the world what exactly the progress has been. And 
if you have progress, then you will be willing to come and make that 
argument to us here. And then we will have another vote, and we will 
decide if we are going to release the rest of the money or do something 
else, begin winding it down even quicker.

But I find it very disturbing, Mr. Speaker, that the President of the 
United States is not willing to come to the United States Congress, 
created by Article I, section 1 of the Constitution, the people's 
House, and articulate why our soldiers are still in Iraq, why we're not 
having success, why benchmarks aren't being met, why the Iraqi soldiers 
aren't being trained. You come back to the United States Congress and 
you tell us what the situation is, and then we control the money, and 
if there's progress we will give you more. If it continues like it's 
been going, we're going to give you enough to get these kids back home.
