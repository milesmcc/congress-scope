Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I thank our Speaker and the majority leader for 
scheduling this long overdue debate on Iraq. For 4 years we have 
suffered from a Congress that was unwilling to lead, and content simply 
to follow on Iraq. The previous majority gave the President a blank 
check for the war and rubber-stamped the funding. They ignored 
oversight, avoided investigations, and stifled debate.

Today in Iraq, the price of this neglect is the loss of too many 
American lives caught in the crossfire of a sectarian civil war.

Now our new Democratic leaders and committee chairs are asserting 
Congress' constitutional responsibilities on war and peace. We are 
reclaiming a congressional role in foreign policy in order to bring a 
responsible end to the U.S. military involvement in Iraq. One step is 
this resolution, which sends a vital signal of disapproval of the 
President's escalation plan. Another is the


ambitious list of long overdue oversight hearings.

In the first 5 weeks of this Congress, we held more hearings on Iraq 
than the Republicans held in all of 2006. The next step, we should use 
the appropriations bills to shape policy in Iraq.

I strongly support the Skelton-Lantos resolution, which expresses 
support for the troops and disapproval of the President's escalation. 
Only a political solution, not a military one, will address the 
sectarian conflict in Iraq. Yet President Bush has rejected the wisdom 
of his military commanders, the Iraq Study Group, and many other 
experts by choosing to send more troops into a Sunni-Shia conflict that 
we cannot control.

Escalation, we know, is opposed by the majority of the American 
people. More telling, it is opposed by a majority of the Iraqi people. 
When the White House war plans diverge from the wishes of the people 
and leaders of Iraq, we must question the relevance of the mission. Our 
statement on the escalation is important, but our constituents also 
deserve to know our position on an exit strategy.

We cannot make needed investments in our future until we put our 
involvement in Iraq in the past. This war is straining our military and 
undermining our ability to deal with domestic challenges. We must force 
Iraqis to take responsibility for their own security by directing an 
orderly redeployment of the troops and promoting a political solution 
in Iraq with a focus on transition to Iraqi control.

Recent experience shows that the U.S. must impose deadlines with 
consequences so that Iraqi leaders will be compelled to take 
responsibility. An indefinite U.S. military experience in Iraq creates 
a climate of dependency that undermines the goal of having the Iraqi 
Government control internal security. It is not in our national 
interests to have U.S. troops placed between warring factions in a 
sectarian war.

To achieve this goal, I support H.R. 645, a bill introduced by 
Representative David Price and Representative Brad Miller. The bill 
terminates, by December 31, 2007, the authorization for military 
operations in Iraq that passed, over my objection, in 2002. The 
original mission, eliminating weapons of mass destruction and ousting 
Saddam Hussein, is no longer operative.

If the President believes troops should remain in Iraq beyond 2007, 
he must come to Congress and justify a new mission, and Congress would 
have to vote to approve a new mission. H.R. 645 also requires the 
President to submit a plan and timetable for phasing out troop 
deployments by December 31, 2007. It prohibits funding for permanent 
U.S. bases in Iraq. It authorizes funding for employment, democracy, 
and governance programs in that country, and it creates a Special Envoy 
for Iraq regional security.

America's servicemen and women who have been sent to Iraq have served 
with skill, determination, and courage. We owe them and their families 
our gratitude and our unwavering support.

Like every Member of Congress, I have been to too many funerals not 
to understand the sacrifice of those who have served, and their 
families. Neither H. Con. Res. 63 nor H.R. 645 cuts our funding for 
armor and protective equipment still needed by troops in the war zone. 
Congress must take a long overdue leadership role in ending this war. 
This resolution is an important first step, and I urge all Members to 
support it.
