`Mr. GRASSLEY â€” 11 September 2007`

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow, on this day of 
the 6th Anniversary of the September 11th attacks, that I speak in 
honor of a fallen American hero. Army Sgt. Kevin Gilbertson died August 
31st at the Landstuhl Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, after 
losing a 2-day battle with injuries suffered after insurgents attacked 
his unit in Ramadi, Iraq. His courage and patriotism will be 
remembered. My thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family, 
especially his parents, Keeley Peters and Don Gilbertson, as well as 
his wife, Nina, and sons, Timothy and Nickolas.

Sergeant Gilbertson was an independent, complex, and highly involved 
individual. He loved his family, he loved his country, and he loved 
being a U.S. Army soldier. Kevin Gilbertson's service to this country 
is greatly appreciated, and he will be sorely missed.

Kevin was a native of Cedar Rapids, IA. His father, Don Gilbertson, 
remembers him as ''the greatest kid in the world'' who ''joined the 
Army right out of high school to get a college education when he got 
out . . . His dream was getting a degree and supporting his family.'' 
Kevin Gilbertson will always be remembered as someone who gave 
everything he had for his country and who thought more about others 
than himself. For that we are eternally grateful.
