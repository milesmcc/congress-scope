Mr. WU. Just as my friend from Illinois has modified his presentation 
in light of current reality, I will not, unless necessary, reprise the 
reason for the difference between a $60 barrel of oil and a $120 barrel 
of oil, which is the war in Iraq, rank speculation by people who can't 
take delivery of the oil, and low, cheap currency doctrine by this 
administration that has imported inflation and increased oil prices.
