Mr. BISHOP of New York. I thank the chairman for yielding.

I rise to join my colleague, Representative Carol Shea-Porter, in 
urging my colleagues to support our amendment which would ban the use 
of open burn pits in war zones.

Disturbing reports are coming to light every day about the reckless 
disposal of hazardous waste in open burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan 
and the devastating toll they are taking on the health of hundreds of 
our service men and women. It is encouraging that Secretary Shinseki 
and Secretary Gates have responded to our questions and stated they 
have taken seriously our concerns about the danger of burn pits, but 
this legislation is necessary to see to it that this action takes 
place.

The legislation is endorsed by the American Legion, by the DAV, by 
the IAVA, by the National Guard Association, and by the VFW. I urge its 
passage.
