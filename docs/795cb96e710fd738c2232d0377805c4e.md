`Mr. REID â€” 5 February 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning 
business until 4 p.m. today. During morning business, Senator Byrd is 
to be recognized for up to 60 minutes. At 4 p.m. we will resume debate 
on the motion to proceed to S. 470, the sense-of-Congress language 
relating to Iraq. Last Thursday I moved to proceed to that bill and 
filed a cloture motion. That vote is slated to occur today at 5:30.















 Order of Procedure


I now ask unanimous consent that the time from 4 to 5:20 be equally 
divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, and 
the final 10 minutes prior to 5:30 p.m. be equally divided between the 
two leaders, with the majority leader controlling the last 5 minutes.
