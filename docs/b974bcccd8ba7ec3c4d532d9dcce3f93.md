# FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007
## `b974bcccd8ba7ec3c4d532d9dcce3f93`
`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 25 January 2007`

---


Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this report in the New York Times is the 
reason our people are becoming angrier by the day as the war rages on. 
They expect Congress to be an effective restraint on the President and 
his misuse of the war power. Opposition to the escalation of the Iraq 
war is becoming louder. How much clearer does the opposition have to be 
before the President finally listens and responds to the voices of the 
American people, the generals, and a bipartisan majority of Congress?

General Abizaid doesn't support this escalation. He told the Senate 
Armed Services Committee:




 More American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, 


 from taking more responsibility for their own future.


GEN James Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps, doesn't support it. 
He said:




 We do not believe just adding numbers for the sake of 


 adding numbers--just thickening the mix--is necessarily the 


 way to go.


Secretary Powell said that he is not ''persuaded that another surge 
of troops in Baghdad for the purpose of suppressing this communitarian 
violence, this civil war, will work.''

GEN Barry McCaffrey, former Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, 
thinks it won't work. He said:




 Putting another 20,000 to 30,000 troops, particularly in 


 urban combat in a city of 7 million Arabs of Baghdad, is a 


 fool's errand. It is sticking your finger in the water. When 


 you pull your finger out, its presence will not have made a 


 difference.


General Hoar, former head of CENTCOM, told the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee last week:




 The addition of 21,000 troops is too little and too late. 


 This is still not enough to quell the violence, and without 


 major changes in the command and control of forces within 


 Baghdad, the current set-up for shared control is 


 unsatisfactory.


Passage of the bipartisan resolution approved yesterday by the 
Foreign Relations Committee is an important statement about the need 
for a different course in Iraq, and I will support it. But we cannot 
stop there, especially if the President continues to unilaterally 
impose his failing policy on an America that has already rejected it. 
Congress has a constitutional duty to stop the President from sending 
more of our sons and daughters into this civil war. That is why I have 
introduced legislation that would require the President to get the 
authority he needs from Congress before moving forward with a further 
escalation in Iraq, and I intend to seek a vote on it.

This is a debate about what is best for our troops and our national 
security. Our forces have served with great valor. They have done 
everything they have been asked to do. They have served in Iraq for 
longer than 4 years, longer than World War II. They have done 
everything they have been asked to do. They have won every battle they 
have been in, and they have served with great courage and great valor. 
We owe them. We owe their bravery, their courage, their dedication, and 
their commitment to the United States of America a better and fairer 
policy that will bring them safely home.
