Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Representing the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, 
I rise to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 334, 
as amended, a resolution supporting the goals and objectives of 
National Military Appreciation Month, which, for the past 10 years, has 
been recognized in the month of May.

Initially created by an act of Congress back in 1999, the National 
Military Appreciation Month provides each and every one of us an 
opportunity to acknowledge and honor the heroic men and women who have 
served and are now serving in our country's Armed Forces.

The bill before us was introduced on April 24, 2008, by Congressman 
Christopher Shays of Connecticut. And while cosponsored by only 60 
Members of Congress, I am sure that each and every member of this body 
stands in support and admiration of the thousands of men and women 
serving in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.

The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform amended and reported 
the bill favorably by voice vote on May 15, 2008, and today we now have 
a chance to move the bill one step closer to enactment.

Mr. Speaker, let us join with citizens across America in showing our 
appreciation for the service and sacrifice these brave men and women 
display in order to provide for the defense and the protection of our 
great country. In particular, let us show our gratitude to those 
currently serving abroad in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other pockets of the 
world, and to the families that stand by and support their loved ones 
during deployment in times of war.

The passage of H. Con. Res. 334 will send a strong message to our 
troops and veterans that we honor, respect, and appreciate their 
dedication to the liberties and freedoms we as Americans hold so dear.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the goals and the 
objectives of National Military Appreciation Month by voting in favor 
of H. Con. Res. 334.

I reserve the balance of my time.
