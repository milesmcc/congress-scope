`Mr. SCOTT of Georgia â€” 10 June 2009`

Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, while I'm sure 
well-intended by the gentlelady, would strike a section of the bill 
waiving the ban against dissemination of public diplomacy materials 
within the United States to make the film, ''A Fateful Harvest,'' 
available for public viewing.

Mr. Chairman, the Voice of America's Afghan service has produced this 
52-minute documentary examining the narcotics industry in Afghanistan, 
including poppy growing, opium production, trafficking, law enforcement 
efforts, and the harmful health effects of drugs. It documents the 
challenges facing the Afghan Government as well as our own.



Financed by the Department of State's Bureau of International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, the film has aired inside 
Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto. A low-resolution version of the film 
has been available on Voice of America's Web site and in six separate 
parts on YouTube.

Mr. Chair, Voice of America has received several requests for a clean 
copy of the documentary in its original high resolution and in one 
single piece for viewing at U.S. venues because of the film's 
educational value. Among those seeking access to this single clean copy 
are the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International 
Studies Center on Politics and Foreign Relations and an Afghan 
students' group at the University of Virginia.

On the area of cost that my good friend on the other side pointed 
out, there is no cost. Any additional copies of the film will be made 
available for purchase, which would cover the cost of copying, however 
small it may be.

Mr. Chair, on many occasions during the history of USIA and the 
Broadcasting Board of Governors, Congress has passed legislation to 
waive the domestic dissemination ban, known colloquially as Smith-
Mundt, to make a film available for public viewing in the United 
States. It is a simple matter with many precedents. This should be one 
of those occasions. And in reference to not having it done before, on 
three different occasions, Mr. Chair, three different authorizations, 
section 203 of the U.S. Information Agency FY 1990 and '91; section 204 
in 1988 and '89; section 205 in FY97, different occasions when this has 
happened before. So with due respect for the lady from Florida, we 
certainly respect her; but we oppose the amendment.

Mr. Chair, I now recognize for 2 minutes the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Klein).
