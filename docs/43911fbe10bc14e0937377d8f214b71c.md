Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.

Recently, I participated in a congressional delegation down in 
Guantanamo, the first congressional delegation since the President 
ordered that Guantanamo will be closed. We saw the detainees down 
there. We saw the top 16 al Qaeda operatives. We saw Khalid Sheikh 
Mohammed praying, bowing to Mecca. To look at the man who was 
responsible for the death of 3,000 Americans was perhaps the most 
chilling experience of my congressional career.

As a former Federal prosecutor, to extend constitutional protections 
to these detainees as criminal defendants is, in my view, setting a 
very dangerous precedent. They were captured on the battlefield, and 
they're enemies of war.

The Souder amendment--while I do support the overall bill--the denial 
of the Souder amendment raises big concerns, in my view. The idea that 
detainees held in Guantanamo cannot be placed on the No Fly List begs 
the question who is qualified to be put on the No Fly List. And since 
that time, we've released 500 detainees from Guantanamo, 60 of whom 
have been captured on the battlefield trying to kill our soldiers in 
Afghanistan.

So I would like to pose a question to the distinguished chairman of 
the Homeland Security Committee, and I would be happy to yield time to 
him.

And the question is simply this: We have debated whether the 
detainees currently being held should be on the No Fly List. In my view 
it's a no-brainer that we should reach agreement on in a bipartisan 
way. But as to the 530 who have been released from Guantanamo, does the 
chairman know whether or not they have been placed on the Terrorist 
Watch List or the No Fly List?

I yield.
