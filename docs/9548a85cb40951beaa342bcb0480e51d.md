Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I understand that. Iraq is not currently 
there, but here's the deal. This is not just for now. It is conceivable 
to me that Iraq will end up owing us money. I hope it will, because 
we've sure given them a lot, and if they don't owe us any money, it's a 
big gift.

So the question is going forward, if in the future, because there is 
no current list of countries, we're talking about an eligibility 
criteria. Would this prevent debt relief from the United States or the 
International Monetary Fund, to the World Bank, to Iraq going forward?

I would yield to anyone who would answer.
