Mr. GOODE. Madam Speaker, I rise to thank the men and women in the 
United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard for 
serving our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. They 
are honorably and bravely fighting terrorists overseas in order to 
protect American families at home.

One way we can say ''thank you'' to these brave men and women is to 
adopt a Veterans appropriations bill, stand-alone, with a unanimous or 
near unanimous vote. It does not need to be wrapped up into something 
else. We need to send a loud and clear ''thank you'' to our veterans in 
a veterans-only bill. Let's do it. Let's vote it up and say a great 
''thank you'' before Veterans Day to our veterans.
