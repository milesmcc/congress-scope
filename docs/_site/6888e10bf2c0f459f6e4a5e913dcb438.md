Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank an active member of the fiscally 
responsible Blue Dog Democrat Coalition, the gentlewoman from Illinois, 
Melissa Bean, for being a part of this discussion this evening to talk 
about the Blue Dog Coalition's resolution to demand accountability for 
how tax money is being spent in Iraq, just as we do here at home 
through our Blue Dog 12-point plan for budget reform.

This resolution will be filed on the floor of this House this week as 
the Blue Dog Coalition demands this administration to be accountable 
for how your tax money, Mr. Speaker, is being spent in Iraq.

At this time I yield to the gentleman from New York, a new member of 
the Blue Dog Coalition, someone who has come here and been a very 
active member of our coalition and has been doing a lot to help us with 
this resolution, and that is the gentleman from New York, Mike Arcuri.
