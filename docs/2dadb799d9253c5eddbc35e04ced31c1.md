`Mr. SMITH â€” 2 August 2007`

---


Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, may I read this before he objects? I wonder 
if my colleagues would indulge me.

Mr. President, this amendment is the outgrowth of a bill I introduced 
with Senator Kohl this year. As many of my colleagues know, Congress 
modified the Supplemental Security Income Program to include a 7-year 
time limit on receipt of benefits for disabled refugees and asylees. 
This policy was intended to balance a desire to have people who 
immigrate to the United States to become citizens, with an 
understanding that the naturalization process also takes time to 
complete.

Unfortunately, the naturalization process often takes longer than 7 
years. Applicants are required to live in the United States for a 
minimum of 5 years prior to applying for citizenship. In addition to 
that time period, their application process often can take 3 or more 
years before resolution. Because of this time delay, many individuals 
are trapped in the system and faced with the loss of their SSI 
benefits. In fact, we know that to date, more than 7,000 elderly and 
disabled refugees have lost their SSI benefits and another 16,000 are 
threatened to lose their benefits as well in the coming years.

Many of these individuals are elderly refugees who fled persecution 
or torture in their home countries. They include Jews fleeing religious 
persecution from the former Soviet Union, Iraqi Kurds fleeing from 
Saddam Hussein's regime, Cubans, and Hmong people from the highlands of 
Laos who served on the side of the U.S. military during the Vietnam 
war. They are elderly and unable to work and have become reliant on 
their SSI benefits as their primary income. To penalize them because of 
delays encountered through the bureaucratic process is unjust and 
inappropriate.

The Bush administration in its fiscal year 2008 budget acknowledged 
the necessity to correct this problem, this injustice, by dedicating 
funding to extend refugee eligibility for SSI beyond the 7-year limit.

This legislation builds upon those efforts by allowing an additional 
2 years of benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, asylees, and 
other qualified humanitarian immigrants, including those whose benefits 
have expired in the recent past.

Additionally, benefits could be extended for a third year for those 
same refugees who are awaiting a decision on a pending naturalization 
application.

These policies are limited to 2010 and are completely offset in cost 
by a provision that will work to recapture Federal Government funds due 
to unemployment insurance fraud.

The offset that is provided was also taken from the President's own 
budget.

By reducing fraud in the unemployment insurance system, the provision 
would effectively reduce taxes on employers by $326 million over the 
next 10 years, according to the CBO estimate.

I thank my colleagues for listening. I hope for your support and ask 
that this amendment be accepted by unanimous consent.
