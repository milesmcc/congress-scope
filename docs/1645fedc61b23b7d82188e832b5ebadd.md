# DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008
## `1645fedc61b23b7d82188e832b5ebadd`
`Mr. CORNYN â€” 25 July 2007`

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in support of 
the Graham amendment, of which I am pleased to be a cosponsor, and to 
provide my colleagues some information I found particularly revealing 
in the form of a four-part series in my hometown newspaper, the San 
Antonio Express News, written in May of 2007. The author of the series, 
a reporter by the name of Todd Bensman, chronicles the movement of an 
Iraqi individual from Damascus, Syria, to Detroit, MI. It is 
particularly instructive, as we are contemplating this amendment and 
the importance of funding border security measures, that this kind of 
information be brought to the attention of the Senate.

I ask unanimous consent to have the first of the four-part article 
from MySA.com entitled ''Breaching America: War refugees or threats?'' 
printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
