Mr. KUCINICH. I rise in opposition to the bill.

We've lost over 3,600 of our brave service men and women; 1 million 
innocent Iraqis have perished in the war. We're now telling Iraqis, 
whose country the U.S. destroyed, whose reconstruction funds the U.S. 
mishandled, whose social networks have been shredded, stand on your own 
feet, while we try to steal their oil under the cover of occupation.

This bill will not end the war. This bill will not end the 
occupation. It doesn't take a vote to end this war. We must inform the 
administration that the $97 billion appropriated last month is the end 
of the financing for the war. Use the money that is in the pipeline 
through October 1st to bring the troops home. Compel the President to 
put together an international peacekeeping security force which would 
move in as our troops leave.

We could have our troops home by October 1. The question is whether 
we're ready to take a stand to do that, or whether or not we're going 
to vote on resolutions that give the American people the appearance 
that we want to end the war, without actually addressing the central 
issue that will end the war: Stop the funding.
