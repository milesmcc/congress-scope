`Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN â€” 14 February 2007`

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Speaker, during the debate on Iraq yesterday, we heard many times 
from some of our Democratic colleagues that they had no intention of 
defunding our troops in Iraq. Some even expressed outrage and 
indignation when some of our Republican Members made mention of their 
plans for defunding the troops. However, defunding plans clearly 
demonstrate their policy is to withdraw from the global war against 
Islamic militant extremists by surrendering to the enemy in Iraq.

We are faced with two options in Iraq, Mr. Speaker, to move forward 
or to retreat. Some of my Democrat colleagues appear to be united in 
opposing any effort to adopt a more vigorous strategy in Iraq and, 
instead, are ready to retreat. This resolution is but the first step in 
that direction.

Despite denials, the evidence is that the effort to cut the funding 
of our troops in Iraq and, in turn, for all of our efforts there are 
well underway.

Several bills have already been introduced by Democrat Members to 
compel a withdrawal. Let me read the titles and the provisions.

H.R. 508, to require the United States military disengagement from 
Iraq, which mandates a withdrawal of U.S. forces within 6 months of the 
enactment of this act and which cuts off funding for any deployment or 
continued deployment of forces in Iraq. Let me emphasize that again. It 
cuts off funding for any deployment, not just an increase, not just 
sending reinforcements, but for any deployment of U.S. forces in Iraq, 
including those already there, and it even limits the number of embassy 
personnel.

Also, H.R. 438, to prohibit an escalation in the number of members of 
the United States Armed Forces in Iraq, which states that funds 
appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense 
under any provision of law may not be obligated or expended to increase 
the number of members of the United States Armed Forces serving in 
Iraq.

H.R. 746, to provide for the safe and orderly withdrawal of United 
States military forces and Department of Defense contractors from Iraq, 
which mandates the beginning of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq 
within 30 days of the enactment of this act and complete the withdrawal 
no later than 180 days later. It also prohibits


funds to increase the number of Armed Forces serving in Iraq or to 
extend the deployment of those already there.

Or H.J. Res. 18, to redeploy U.S. forces from Iraq, which states that 
the deployment of United States forces in Iraq by the direction of 
Congress is hereby terminated, and the forces involved are to be 
redeployed at the earliest practical date.

When we offered a proposal to prohibit the cutting off of funds for 
our troops, that is what we wanted to do on our side of the aisle, a 
proposal to prohibit cutting off of funding of our troops in harm's 
way, the Democratic leadership blocked it from coming to the floor. 
Why? Well, based on the bills that I just mentioned, the only 
explanation I would think is that they fear that their caucus would 
indeed vote to cut off funding for our troops and leave them to face 
the enemy without the necessary resources.

So, within this context, they offer this nonbinding resolution which 
the Democrat leadership claims to support the troops. But how can such 
a claim be credible? Because in the second paragraph of the resolution, 
it opposes sending the reinforcements that our troops in Iraq need to 
confront the enemy.



Our commanders in the field say they need the reinforcements in order 
to address the security situation in Iraq. My stepson Douglas Lehtinen 
and my daughter-in-law, Lindsay, served in Iraq as Marine officers. 
Lindsay will soon serve in just a few weeks in Afghanistan. They 
understand the difference between saying we support our troops but we 
don't support your mission. It is the mission that matters.

Some of our colleagues seek to deny our troops that level of support, 
that level of backup which could be the difference for Dougie, for 
Lindsay, for so many others between death and survival.

This resolution seeks to substitute the assessment of the military 
commanders with the views of lawmakers. We claim to know more than the 
commanders.

Rather than focusing on the strategic policy issue, the Democratic 
leadership has drafted a resolution that undermines tactical military 
matters and seeks to override the decisions of our military commanders 
and the position articulated by General Petraeus. They do not want to 
discuss the grave consequences of withdrawal and surrender. They do not 
want to discuss the nature of the enemy, the Islamist militant 
extremists who seek to destroy us, who like vultures descend on us to 
prey on our weakness.

Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seek to focus 
on the abstract rather than on the reality. They believe that security 
will come from withdrawal and surrender. On the contrary, retreat 
guarantees that the Islamic militants will intensify their efforts 
against us. All we need to do is focus on bin Laden's own words.

In his 1996 Declaration of Jihad and other statements that he made, 
he repeatedly pointed to America's weakness being its low threshold for 
pain. As evidence, bin Laden pointed to the U.S. withdrawal from 
Somalia in 1993 because of casualties from the attacks of al Qaeda and 
its allies. Bin Laden said of our retreat from Mogadishu, ''The extent 
of your impotence and weakness became very clear.''

Bin Laden and the global Islamic militant network continued to test 
our resolve throughout the 1990s and today. They launched multiple 
attacks against U.S. targets with little response on our part. Then 
came the deplorable attacks on 9/11.

But they won't stop there, Mr. Speaker. They won't stop in Iraq, they 
won't stop in Afghanistan. They have made it abundantly clear that they 
will not stop until they dominate the world. Just listen to the words 
of bin Laden.

He said, ''The jihad in Palestine,'' referring to the attacks against 
Israel, ''and in Iraq is a personal duty incumbent upon the residents 
of the two countries alone. But if they are unable to carry it out, 
this duty is incumbent upon the residents of the adjacent countries, 
and so on and so forth, until the circle includes all the Muslim 
countries.''

And to focus on what al Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri said in December of 
last year just a few months ago, ''Iraq, Allah permitting, is the 
gateway to the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of the 
Islamic caliphate.''

Or those of Iran's Ahmadinejad when he said in January of this year, 
''We must prepare ourselves to rule the world.''

This follows statements made in October of 2005 when Ahmadinejad 
said, ''Undoubtedly, I say that we will soon experience a world without 
the United States and will breathe in the brilliant time of Islamic 
sovereignty over today's world.''

It is echoed by other Iranian leaders who have threatened the U.S. 
and moderate Arab governments who say that, ''Anyone who recognizes 
Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nations. They will burn in 
their fury,'' and who have expressed their commitment to bringing 
America to its knees.

The Islamist militant extremist network have proven time and time 
again that this is not mere rhetoric. U.S. allies in the Middle East 
understand this reality. They understand the critical role that Iraq 
plays in the global war against Islamic militant extremists.

For example, Jordan's King Abdullah, a courageous leader who 
continues to demonstrate his country's and his people's commitment to 
peace, to security, and to democratic reform, summarized the situation 
we are facing in the following way. He said, ''My concern is political, 
revolving around Iran, around Iran's political involvement inside Iraq, 
its relation with Syria and Hezbollah, and the strengthening of this 
political strategic alliance. This would create a scenario where you 
have these four: Iran, Iraq, influenced by Iraq, Syria, and Hezbollah, 
who have a strategic objective that would create a major conflict. Our 
argument to the United States,'' he continues, ''is that a capable, 
independent, secure Iraq is the best way of containing Iran. The 
Iranians realize that the way to have success against the West is by 
them succeeding in Iraq. So Iraq is the battleground of the West 
against Iran.''

These are the words of our ally King Abdullah of Jordan. Yet some of 
our colleagues choose to believe that one can reason with our enemies.

Since this resolution provides no concrete alternative, some have 
expressed support for new diplomatic initiatives. However, I must ask 
my colleagues: With whom? Do they propose engaging with rogue regimes 
such as Iran and Syria? These rogue regimes are part of the problem, 
not part of the solution.

Some of our colleagues may say that diplomatic engagement is the key 
to our success. But I ask them, how are we to engage our allies in the 
region to help foster security and reconciliation in Iraq if by our 
withdrawal and surrender we leave them to fend for themselves against 
enemies in the region who have been strengthened by our retreat? How is 
diplomacy to be effective in such an abstract context?

We cannot expect to achieve success if we are operating from a 
position of weakness.

The so-called diplomatic alternative offered by some is no 
alternative at all. The resolution before us and the bills that have 
been introduced is a compelling argument, they believe, for a 
withdrawal from Iraq, but it adds to a policy of surrender.

Some may try to hide that fact by constantly repeating the empty 
words that they support the troops. But supporting our troops cannot be 
reconciled by refusing them the reinforcements that they need or with 
the retreat in the face of the enemy.

The hopelessness with which these measures spring is alien to our 
American spirit. That spirit has sustained us through many dark times, 
Mr. Speaker, throughout our history. This hopeful spirit springs 
directly from the hearts of the American people who have never given up 
faith in their belief, in their country, in their sons and daughters in 
uniform facing our enemies overseas.

Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of our revolution over two centuries 
ago when our country faced almost impossible odds and many counseled 
for retreat, Thomas Payne summoned forth the words that apply directly 
to the debate in this Chamber when he said, ''These are the times that 
try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in 
this crisis shrink from the service of their country, but he that 
stands by it now deserves the love and


the thanks of every man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily 
conquered, yet we have this consolation with us: That the harder the 
conflict, the more glorious the triumph.''

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues therefore to reject this 
resolution.
