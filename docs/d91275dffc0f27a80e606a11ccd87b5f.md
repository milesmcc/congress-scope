# CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR
## `d91275dffc0f27a80e606a11ccd87b5f`
`Mr. BIDEN â€” 12 March 2008`

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, working under tight constraints, the 
committee reduced the President's budget request by $4.1 billion. I 
understand they have a difficult task and a great staff, but I believe 
we have to do a lot better.

I ask my colleagues today to join me, when this amendment comes 
forward, in restoring the full $39.5 billion the President requested. 
That will allow us to at least continue the work now underway to help 
rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, to support our ongoing nonproliferation 
programs, to provide the manpower and skills for our Civilian 
Stabilization Initiative, to fight AIDS, and to do all the things that 
reduce threats, relieve human suffering, and help to rebuild the moral 
stature of the United States in the world.

Our amendment is supported by the One Campaign, Interaction, the U.S. 
Global Leadership Campaign, and many other groups, many of whom are men 
and women who have worn the uniform their whole life.

The money we are asking for is less than a couple weeks of military 
operations in Iraq. It is an absolutely essential investment in our 
national security. So at the appropriate time, I will urge my 
colleagues to support this amendment.

Madam President, I thank my colleagues for the time on the floor.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.
