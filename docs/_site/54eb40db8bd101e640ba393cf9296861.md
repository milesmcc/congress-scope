## `54eb40db8bd101e640ba393cf9296861`
`Mr. REID â€” 15 November 2007`

---


Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend from Oklahoma 
yielding the floor. I appreciate it very much. He had the right to the 
floor and I hope he was able to complete his statement.

















Golden Gavel


Mr. President, first, I want to recognize the Presiding Officer. One 
of the accolades that we are allowed, and certainly look forward to 
giving to the Members of the Senate, is for those people who preside 
over the Senate for 100 hours a year. My friend from Colorado has 
reached that pinnacle an hour or so ago. That is a tremendous 
accomplishment, 100 hours presiding over the


Senate. I congratulate my friend and look forward to the first time we 
get back after Thanksgiving recess on a caucus day where we make the 
presentation of the very fine golden gavel. As I have said before, it 
is a very nice presentation. You will be able, for many years to come, 
to talk to your children and grandchildren about presiding over the 
Senate for 100 hours in 1 year.

So thank you very much, I say to my friend from Colorado, who does an 
outstanding job not only presiding but being the Senator he is 
representing the people of Colorado.








Transportation Appropriations Conference Report


Mr. President, it is interesting; one Republican Senator said, when 
we were trying to clear something earlier, to one of my Democratic 
friends, the reason they couldn't clear our appropriations bill, the 
Transportation appropriations bill is that they were told the situation 
with the Republicans is they don't want us to do anything, so they 
object to everything they can, and that is pretty obvious. So we were 
prevented from going to the Transportation appropriations bill. It was 
quite unique that in the time we were doing this the Senator from 
Minnesota was on the floor. He, above all others, should be weighing in 
and trying to help us get the Transportation appropriations bill 
passed. There is money in it to rebuild the bridge in Minnesota.

But we have something else that is vitally important: terrorism 
insurance. We are arriving at a point where construction cannot go 
forward. Now construction is already taking place--certainly it can--
but construction projects that are on the drawing boards in a month or 
so will not be able to go forward because they can't get terrorism 
insurance because we have not provided it. We have been ready for some 
time to do that. There is a bill that has been cleared on our side that 
the Republicans are holding up--a bill dealing with the very foundation 
of this country--whether the business community in our country is going 
to have the benefit of terrorism insurance. Without that, it is a 
dramatic hit to what we need to do in this country for the business 
community.

I think it is unfortunate. We asked our staffs to check with the 
minority and they said no, they couldn't clear it; maybe tomorrow. 
Well, we have a lot of tomorrows around here that seem to never come. 
It would be a real shame if we could not clear tomorrow the terrorism 
insurance that is so extremely important to this country.



















Iraq


It was interesting to hear my friend from Oklahoma speak about the 
war in Iraq. But I would ask everyone to look at--and I am sure it is 
not only in this newspaper--a daily newspaper that I had the 
opportunity to read today, the Washington Post, the front page 
headline:




 Iraqis Wasting An Opportunity. Brigadier General John F. 


 Campbell, deputy commanding general of the 1st Cavalry 


 Division, complained last week that Iraqi politicians appear 


 out of touch with everyday citizens. ''The ministers, they 


 don't get out. They don't know what the hell is going on on 


 the ground.''


If you turn over to page 22, which is carrying this forward--and 
there are also some interesting things said in this article.




 So how to force political change in Iraq without 


 destabilizing the country further? ''I pity the guy who has 


 to reconcile that tension,'' said Lieutenant Colonel Douglas 


 Ollivant, the chief of planning for U.S. military operations 


 in Baghdad whose tour ends next month.


Mr. President, the situation in Iraq is very desperate. This 
newspaper article says, among other things:




 The Army officer who requested anonymity said that if the 


 Iraqi government doesn't reach out, then for former Sunni 


 insurgents ''it's game on--they're back to attacking again.''


We have supported the troops for the entire duration of this war. We 
are the ones who recognized that there wasn't body armor for our 
troops, that mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and wives 
were writing personal checks to send armor to the valiant troops in 
Iraq. We are the ones who recognized that. We are the ones who did 
something about the situation we have at Walter Reed, which was a 
scandal, how our veterans were being taken care of, but the President 
wouldn't sign our bill: $4 billion more for these valiant men and women 
who are suffering from things that have never been suffered in any war 
ever before. It is a war that has never been fought before. It is a war 
where these men and women are subject to these phantom attacks, and 
when they go home after their tour or tours of duty end and they have 
all their limbs and they can see, they are not paralyzed, they haven't 
been shot, they still have to get over this post-traumatic stress 
syndrome, because they have seen their friends get killed or blown up 
and injured.

I think it is very important to talk about how good our soldiers are, 
and that is what my friend from Oklahoma is doing. We agree. We have to 
understand that Iraq is in a state of crisis. You can't have it both 
ways. The President said he needed these extra troops to get the 
political situation in tow in Iraq. He has gotten the troops and now he 
wants to keep them longer. The troops in Iraq now are--because there 
are some people who are coming home and some who have just gone over 
there--there are about 180,500 some troops are there now to be exact, 
right now in Iraq. We don't know how many contractors are there, but 
there are estimates of up to 150,000. How much longer, Mr. President? 
How much longer do the American taxpayers have to take care of a 
country that is the richest or the second richest oil country in the 
whole world? How much longer?

Yesterday we were told that Iraq has a balanced budget. Isn't that 
nice. I am glad they do. Why do we need to keep pouring money into 
them--$12 billion a month. Infrastructure. We have spent billions and 
billions of dollars on infrastructure in Iraq. How much are we spending 
here in America? Our President has to look beyond Iraq and look at 
America.

Earlier today my friend, the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator 
Feingold, came and asked unanimous consent that we could move forward 
on the Feingold-Reid legislation, which, in effect, says we have to get 
our troops out of Iraq very quickly, except those who are there for 
counterterrorism, force stabilization, and limited training of Iraqis. 
We are a coequal branch of government. That is why we believe, Senator 
Feingold and I, that after June 30 of next year, funds would only be 
used for the programs I have mentioned: counterterrorism, protecting 
our assets, and limiting training of Iraqis.

But in our legislation it is not a suggestion, not a goal, but 
binding policy. That legislation recognizes our strong national 
interest in Iraq and the Middle East, but brings to an end the 
rubberstamp and unwavering loyalty in a never-ending war which is the 
hallmark of the Republican-controlled Congress. That legislation 
fundamentally changes course in Iraq and this almost unimaginably high 
price that grows every day. And there are 4,000 dead Americans.

(Mr. SANDERS assumed the Chair.)
