`Mr. HASTINGS of Washington â€” 17 July 2009`

Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

I want to respond to my friend from Massachusetts. He talks about 
deficits, and where were we? Let me point out to this gentleman, the 
highest deficit under George W. Bush's administration was in 2004, and 
that was right after we built up our forces to go into Afghanistan and 
Iraq.

It was slightly over $400 billion. Under your first watch, your first 
watch as the majority in this Congress, the deficit was $460 billion. 
This year it is projected to be $1.8 trillion. And here we are today on 
the floor talking about a bill to expand that deficit another $700 
million.

Boy, talk about--well, I can't say the word. But talk about less than 
truthfulness. It certainly comes from the other side of the aisle on 
this issue.
