Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Feingold-Reid amendment would 
finally bring this disastrous war to a close by safely redeploying our 
troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008.

We can't afford to keep ignoring the rest of the world while we focus 
solely on Iraq. By redeploying our troops from Iraq, we can create a 
more effective, integrated strategy to defeat expanding terrorist 
networks whether they be in Afghanistan, Somalia, Algeria, Morocco, or 
even here at home.

It is time to end a war that is draining our resources, straining our 
military and undermining our national security, and the way to do that 
is by using our power of the purse to safely bring our brave troops out 
of Iraq. That is what the Feingold-Reid amendment does.

Over 6 months ago, the American people voted to bring this war to a 
close. Today, by passing the Feingold-Reid amendment, the Senate can 
finally do the same thing.

I yield the floor.
