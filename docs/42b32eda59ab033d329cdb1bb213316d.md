Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to point out the 
relentless work done on this issue of traumatic brain injury by Mr. 
Pascrell from New Jersey, who is the chair, and also by Mr. Todd Platts 
from Pennsylvania, who is the co-chair. I have accompanied both of 
those gentlemen, I have seen their work in Iraq and Afghanistan. They 
have seen the situation in Balad, in the field hospitals in Iraq, as 
well as the military hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, the military 
hospital there, as well as going back to Walter Reed Army Hospital. 
They know full well the extent of this. They are our most outspoken 
advocates on behalf of families whose loved ones have been affected 
with TBI, and we are all indebted to their hard work.

Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support the measure of Mr. 
Pascrell of New Jersey and Mr. Platts of Pennsylvania and support House 
Resolution 178.

I yield back the balance of my time.
