Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Armored Humvees. Up-armored Humvees. Kevlar vests. 
The proper amount of rest.

I want you, Mr. Meek, to try to name me one person in this country 
that would dare send one of their own kids off to war without the 
proper equipment, that would not ride in a Humvee that was armored. And 
there are kids still getting killed in Iraq now because the Humvees are 
light armored and not heavy armored. They don't have the proper 
equipment and everything else. We are still losing kids because of 
that.
