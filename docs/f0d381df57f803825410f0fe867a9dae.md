`Mr. REID â€” 26 June 2008`

Mr. REID. Mr President, momentarily, the Senate will move to pass the 
domestic portion of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill.

After months of negotiation, I am confident that we will pass this 
legislation by an overwhelming bipartisan margin.

For our troops, for the unemployed, and for those who have suffered 
from natural disasters and economic hardship, this legislation is a 
long-overdue victory.

I am glad we have reached this point, but it has not come easily.

My colleagues will recall that when President Bush requested yet 
another supplemental war funding bill, he said to Congress--give me my 
war money and not a penny more.

He said that even after appropriating $660 billion for war, any 
effort by Congress to address our needs here at home would be met with 
a veto.

Some of our Republican colleagues said--why bother trying--why take 
the


time to legislate--when the President has made his veto plans clear?

Our answer then was it is our job to legislate.

The Constitution calls for three separate but equal branches of 
government.

A President's veto threat must not stop us from doing what we think 
is right.

So we did not blink or back down. We said that after $600 billion 
spent on Iraq, it is long past time to take care of some problems right 
here in America.

We did exactly what the Congress is meant to do: we legislated. We 
negotiated. We compromised.

And because we did, we now stand ready to deliver a major victory for 
the American people.

After months of inching ever closer--despite some Republicans who 
said it wasn't worth the cost--we are delivering a new GI bill to our 
courageous troops.

Some on the other side of the aisle started out opposing this effort. 
My Republican colleagues from Arizona, South Carolina, and North 
Carolina opposed it, apparently because they and others felt it was too 
generous to the troops who serve.

They pursued their own bill, which in my view was but a pale shadow 
of the GI bill we vote on tonight.

It would have fallen far short of providing our troops what they 
deserve. In the face of their opposition, we persisted.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the original GI bill into 
law 64 years ago.

He said at the time that the bill ''Gives emphatic notice to the men 
and women in our Armed Forces that the American people do not intend to 
let them down.''

Since President Roosevelt affixed his name to that historic 
legislation, nearly 8 million veterans have advanced their education, 
gotten better jobs, and blazed a path to a brighter future for 
themselves and their families.

Those 8 million men and women have gone on to become teachers, 
doctors, entrepreneurs and public servants.

Several of our colleagues are among them--Dan Akaka, Chuck Hagel, Dan 
Inouye, Frank Lautenberg, Ted Stevens, John Warner and Jim Webb.

I don't think it is presumptuous to say that each one of them would 
credit the GI bill as one reason for what they have achieved.

In his time, President Roosevelt promised to never let our troops 
down, and today we stand poised to renew and reinvigorate his pledge.

The new GI bill will increase educational benefits for all members of 
the military who have served on active duty since September 11, 
including reservists and National Guard.

The years since September 11 have seen our troops strained to a level 
not seen since Vietnam, so these benefits are hard-earned and well-
deserved.

This new GI bill so covers college expenses to match the full cost of 
an in-state public school, plus books and a stipend for housing.

For those who have said it costs too much, I say our troops have more 
than earned it.

And every dollar we invest in educating our veterans today comes back 
to our economy seven times over.

But, new GI bill is not the only important investment this 
supplemental legislation makes.

It also extends unemployment insurance for all states by 13 weeks and 
an additional 13 weeks for States with the highest unemployment.

The Congressional Budget Office and many economists say that 
extending unemployment insurance is among the most effective steps we 
can take to stimulate the economy.

We have talked for months about the need to help struggling Americans 
keep their heads above water as our economy continues to flounder. We 
could have passed this extension months ago, but passing it today is an 
important step.

This supplemental appropriations bill also: Provides long overdue 
assistance to victims of Hurricane Katrina with matching funds for 
levee construction, law enforcement, hospitals, homelessness and 
reconstruction projects in Mississippi; comes to the aid of victims of 
other natural disasters like floods and droughts that have devastated 
certain crops; rolls back the Bush administration's attempts to 
regulate Medicaid into oblivion by blocking six of seven administration 
regulations aimed at depriving children, the elderly and people with 
disabilities of critical services; and, this legislation invests in a 
variety of other critical priorities, including infrastructure repair, 
food and drug safety, and firefighters' assistance.

It is no secret that many Democrats--myself included--wish that there 
was no such thing as an emergency supplemental appropriations bill.

We wish that the urgent domestic needs of the American people had 
been addressed by President Bush and funded in the ordinary budget 
process.

And we wish that the $660 billion we have already spent on the war in 
Iraq could have gone toward eliminating our record deficit, and 
investing in schools, hospitals, roads, job training and public safety.

But despite the crushing weight of a war that will cost us well more 
than $2 trillion when all is said and done--it is our responsibility to 
always put the needs of the American people first.

This supplemental appropriations bill fulfills that responsibly. I 
urge all of my colleagues to support it.
