Mr. KUCINICH. Let's hope that the National Intelligence Estimate will 
stop the drumbeat of war against Iran. This administration knew full 
well that Iran did not have a nuclear weapons program in the same way 
that they knew that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction.

Now that Congress knows that the administration misled the Congress 
and brought Congress into voting time after time after time to isolate 
Iran, it's time for diplomatic relations, but it's also time for 
Congress to hold this administration accountable for trying to lead us 
into a war against Iran. It's time, once again, to start talking about 
the impeachment of the President and to act upon the impeachment of the 
Vice President for attempting to mislead us into a war against Iran.
