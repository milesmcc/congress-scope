Mr. LEVIN. We need to be clear on our strategy first, then address 
the question of the resources that are needed to be committed to that 
strategy.

Under the amendment which I am offering, which will be voted on 
concurrently, or at the same time as the McCain amendment, we are going 
to have, if this amendment is adopted, a hearing not just on resources 
but on strategy and resources.

We are going to have that hearing, if this amendment is adopted, at 
the appropriate time, not with an arbitrary deadline, which sets a very 
bad premise. I believe in this circumstance, similar to the Bush Iraq 
surge circumstance, where the President of the United States, be it 
President Bush or President Obama, has before him and is considering, 
in a very deliberative way, this kind of a life-and-death decision.

Under the Levin amendment, there will be a hearing without an 
arbitrary deadline, but the hearing will take place and could take 
place long before November 15. The hearing under my amendment will take 
place promptly after the decision is made by the President.

There is another difference between the two amendments. In addition 
to the Levin amendment including a hearing on strategy as well as 
resources, again, General McChrystal says the strategy is the crux of 
the matter, not just resources. So under the Levin amendment, the 
hearing will look at both the decision on strategy as well as on 
resources.


Secondly, under the Levin amendment, the testimony will come after 
the decision of President Obama, just the way we had hearings after the 
decision by President Bush.

Third, the hearings will include testimony not only from the Central 
Command commander and from General McChrystal, our Afghanistan 
commander, and the Ambassador to Afghanistan, under the Levin amendment 
the hearing will also take testimony from senior civilian officials and 
military officials not included in the McCain amendment, including the 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and the Ambassador to Pakistan. That is the third 
difference between the two amendments which we will be voting on at 2 
o'clock.

Finally, in addition to outlining those three critical differences 
between the two amendments, I want to read from a letter received 
yesterday--or this morning from Secretary Gates by the majority leader.




 I am writing in response to your request for an update on 


 the . . . strategy and resource assessments prepared by 


 General Stanley McChrystal.


He goes through a number of paragraphs describing pretty much what we 
all know, including that General McChrystal's initial assessment, which 
has been available to us, ''will serve as the prime focus'' of the 
review the President has undertaken, ''although other options and 
perspectives will also be included.'' So in addition to General 
McChrystal's initial assessment, he will also be looking at other 
options and considering other perspectives.

Then Secretary Gates says the following in this letter to the 
majority leader:




 The decisions that the President faces may be some of the 


 most important on Afghanistan in his presidency, so it 


 behooves us to take the necessary time to make sure we get 


 this right. That said, there are a number of internal 


 meetings scheduled over the next few weeks on this topic. I 


 do not expect decisions on the overall strategy--or the 


 resources necessary to carry it out--to take an extended 


 period of time.


He concludes as follows:




 Until the President makes his decision on the way forward 


 in Afghanistan, it would be inappropriate for me--or our 


 military commanders--to openly discuss the advice being 


 provided or the nature of the discussions being carried out 


 with the President. However, once the President acts, I will 


 be happy to testify before the appropriate committees of the 


 Congress and to facilitate similar testimony by commanders 


 and other senior Department leaders.


I believe that is the right approach. It is the approach we took when 
President Bush was considering for 3 months whether to surge troops in 
Iraq. We did not try to bring his Iraq commander before the Congress 
for public hearings, a commander who history has indicated--at least it 
was fairly clear at the time--had a very different perspective than his 
Commander in Chief. We did not put him in that position. We didn't do 
that to the President of the United States, to have his commander in 
the field come before us and say what his opinions were that he was 
giving to the President at that time. We should not do that now.

I yield the floor.
