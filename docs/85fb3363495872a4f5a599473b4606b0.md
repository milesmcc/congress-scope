Mrs. BLACKBURN. What is going to happen if we leave Iraq? What are 
the Iraqi people going to do if we leave Iraq? What is going to happen 
in the Middle East?

Somebody asked me earlier today, asked me, how many more people have 
to die? I said that is the question to ask the terrorists: How many 
more people have to die?

But what we do know is that we cannot let down our guard. We do have 
to continue to fight. We have to realize terror and the war on terror 
is a new enemy. They do not have a headquarters. They do not show 
allegiance to a country. They do not wear a uniform. They are an 
illusive enemy.

Right now they are saying the central battle front is Iraq. September 
11, 2001, we know where that central battle front was.
