`Mr. ENSIGN â€” 15 April 2010`

---


Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Carper. I appreciate him 
and his staff. Wendy was absolutely terrific in setting up this trip 
and all the various briefings and places where we traveled in both 
Afghanistan and Pakistan. I thought we had a great team put together 
among the Senator from Delaware, myself, Senator Brown, Senator Udall, 
and the Congressman from the First District of Virginia, Congressman 
Wittman, whom I did not know before the trip but with whom I was very 
impressed.

My general impression of what is going on in Afghanistan--I was 
initially very skeptical when I went over there. I thought we got an 
honest assessment. I thought they talked about the positives, the 
negatives, and the challenges ahead.

I agree with the Senator from Delaware. I was very impressed with 
both the civilian and military leadership we have in the country. I was 
impressed with the plan they put in place. The key to the plan, which 
is very similar to what we had in Iraq, is we have to clear, basically 
provide security. Then we have to hold that security, not just go and 
clear and then leave. We have to clear and then hold it. Then we have 
to build. We have to give people opportunities, economic opportunities, 
and some reason to hope. Once we build, then we need to transfer the 
authority to, in this case, the Afghan people, the Afghan Government.

The first part is a lot of our responsibility, although a lot of the 
clearing and holding is in combination with the Afghan Army. As a 
matter of fact, I don't think a lot of Americans realize


there have been more Afghan soldiers killed in Afghanistan than 
American soldiers or coalition soldiers. But the challenge is going to 
be in the transfer. We saw that the Afghan Army is being built up and 
trained fairly well.

Two big areas of concern are, one, the Afghan police. It has taken a 
lot longer to train them than we hoped. We experienced some of the same 
problems in Iraq. The Afghan police are not even close to being fully 
trained. There is a lot of corruption in the police. There are a lot of 
challenges to overcome there, but they are challenges that, given the 
right plan, given the right amount of time and resources, can be 
overcome.

Another huge problem in Afghanistan is development of infrastructure. 
I have heard Afghanistan described as an 18th century or 19th century 
country. However, one can really describe it as a second century 
country. There are many parts of it where people are living in mud 
structures with no electricity, with no running water, with none of the 
modern conveniences or technologies we think about.

In those areas, and the vast majority of the country, there is no 
governmental infrastructure. There is no rule of law. There is nothing 
to build on there. It literally has to be built from the ground up. 
There is neither a lot of experience not the necessary resources in 
Afghanistan to do that. That may be the major problem going forward in 
that transfer that I think the members of the delegation learned while 
we were over there. It is also why we questioned, when we came back, if 
we have the right strategy with the best chance of being successful. 
None of us know whether our strategy is actually going to be successful 
in the future. But it is worth attempting. It is in our vital national 
interest to do it. Then we have to pray it is successful in the future.

I think all of us came away thinking the American part of it, the 
international coalition part of it, will be successful. What we do not 
know will be successful is the transfer of authority to the Afghan 
government, the part at the end.

Is that the same impression the Senator from Delaware had?
