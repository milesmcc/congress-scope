Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as I have looked back on my years here, 
one of the chapters I have enjoyed the most is the debates we have had 
together, and this is not in the nature of a debate, Mr. President, but 
I do ask the Senator who now--in your current capacity and your long 
experience in foreign relations, you probably have a better grip than 
most of us as to the likelihood--and you mentioned it--of the political 
reconciliation taking place in Iraq. I am talking about the top down, 
not the smaller, but little things that happened in Al Anbar--which are 
very positive, but I don't think you can grow political reconciliation 
all the way from the bottom up. It has to come from the top down.

Our good friend here, Senator Levin, and I were there in Iraq a few 
weeks ago and we could not find any basis for projecting when that 
might come to pass. That is the very thing that underpins the entire 
policy we are pursuing. Because we all acknowledge a military solution 
is not there. It has to be a political reconciliation from the top 
down--albeit to get some form of unity government--maybe an adaptation 
of what the Senator is now advocating. But what is the Senator's 
projection of the likelihood of that occurring?
