Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman.

This debate is late, very late, thousands of deaths too late. This 
escalation scheme is an unmitigated disaster.

President Bush seems determined to continue to make the same old 
mistakes, just make them a little bit bigger; defying sound military 
judgement; defying the Iraq Study Group; defying the wishes of our 
allies and the Iraqis themselves; and, most particularly, defying the 
will of the American people.

This President continues to pursue a go-it-alone strategy in Iraq. 
Like most every problem that he has created, and there are many, he 
seeks only to pass it along to his successor, who we will elect next 
year--pass along in this case what is no doubt the most colossal 
foreign policy failure in American history.

The administration's top budget official told me in a hearing just 
last week that ''the best minds in the Pentagon'' see no need to fund 
this escalation, which has not yet really begun, for more than another 
seven months. In truth, our military has been so overstretched that it 
cannot sustain a prolonged escalation, even when it unfairly recalls 
inadequately supplied troops for a second, third, and fourth tour of 
duty. Little wonder that the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Gates, admitted 
last week that he is already looking for another plan after this 
escalation falls short.

This week, this House, we say ''stop the increase.'' And next, we 
must begin the decrease with a phased withdrawal from Iraq. We should 
not act precipitously, but we must move very expeditiously to extract 
our troops from the crossfire of the warring factions in this civil war 
quagmire.

To our troops, whose courage we honor today in this very resolution, 
we say to you, those of who you who are out there on the front lines 
today, we will do everything we can to protect you; but we will also be 
working as hard as we can to bring you home safely to your families 
sooner rather than later.

There is a better way to show support for our troops than just 
sending more of them to be killed. There is a better way than 
continuing to give this President a blank check for war funding. Unless 
we move forward to place firm limitations on the appropriations, we 
will leave this war-making President constrained only by Dick Cheney's 
imagination.

The words of our adversaries in this debate have often been very 
short, but their true conflict is not really with us; it is with 
reality. They are in a losing war with the truth. Iraq has never been 
the central front in the war on terrorism. Like the alleged connection 
between 9/11 and Iraq, like the claim that Saddam's nuclear mushroom 
cloud was looming just over the horizon, this charge is but another 
falsehood foisted off on the gullible.

The central front on the war on terrorism was largely abandoned by 
President Bush in his ideological rush to invade Iraq. Vital resources 
and expertise that were needed to capture Osama bin Laden and the 
terrorists who caused 9/11 were cut in Afghanistan when President Bush 
ran into Iraq. The real war on terrorism suffered a major setback from 
which today it has still never recovered. That is the only ''cut and 
run'' that now endangers our families. Nor does this debate in the 
people's House embolden the enemies of democracy when we exercise 
democracy here in America.

To me, the terrorists seem mighty emboldened with their daily death 
and destruction that they wreaked across the Middle East long before 
anyone ever conceived this resolution. Frankly, it is the 
administration that is the terrorists' top recruiter.

As we predicted at the outset, this war is creating new generations 
of terrorists who view it as a war against all Islam. We cannot kill 
our enemies fast enough with the current policies creating more of them 
every day.

And now this President is stoking the flames of war with Iran. 
Ironically, that is the only country in the world to have directly 
benefited from his attacking Iraq. Widening the war to Iran with the 
macho slogan that ''boys go to Baghdad, but real men go to Tehran'' 
risks an even wider, even more destabling debacle that can eventually 
involve our families in a third world war.

Having failed entirely to learn any lessons from Vietnam, this 
administration seems to already have forgotten our experience in Iraq. 
Some here who profess to be conservative have been very liberal with 
billions of misspent taxpayers' dollars and very liberal with the blood 
of others in the sand of Iraq.

President Bush was absolutely correct when he personally declared his 
war in Iraq to be a ''catastrophic success.'' He has certainly been 
successful at creating one catastrophe after another in Iraq.

Our Nation is great enough with sufficient resources and creativity 
to change course, but each day we delay we sink further into a quagmire 
from which fewer and fewer choices remain. We must step back from the 
abyss
