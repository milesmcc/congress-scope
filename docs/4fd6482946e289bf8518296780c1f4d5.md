Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just make an observation, let 
me also thank Senator Warner from Virginia for his work on this, and 
the Senator from Michigan, and say that this publication--and I know 
the two of you have been very supportive of it--by the special 
inspector general for Iraq--this is dated July 30, so it is 2 months 
ago, a month and a half old. This publication has some unbelievable 
information in it about what is necessary, what kinds of expenditures 
exist in the major reconstruction accounts. There is at the moment $7 
billion in the three reconstruction accounts that is unspent and 
unobligated.

As I move this amendment, I wish to work with both of you to see if 
we can construct the amendment in a manner that meets your needs and my 
needs because I believe this will make real progress.

Again, I thank both the chairman and the ranking member for their 
work on these issues. I am well aware of the letter they wrote some 
months ago.
