Mr. WEBB. But I would like to mention some points out of this 
outline. It is a very good survey of the types of things our soldiers 
have to do.

So put yourself in the mind of a soldier who has just finished a 15-
month deployment in Iraq. When they come home for a year, which is all 
they get now after a 15-month deployment, they do not sit around and 
get to know their family and have rest time. There is a little bit of 
that, but month by month during these 12 months of dwell time before 
they have to redeploy, these are the types of things they do:

In the first month, they have 1 to 2 weeks of redeployment from the 
theater back home. That is a part of that first month. They have what 
is called reintegration training for a couple weeks.

In the second month, there is ''block leave,'' but then they activate 
the headquarters. They begin recovery of equipment that was shipped.

In the third through the fifth months, they have recovery operations 
of their equipment. They have the requirement of bringing in newly 
assigned people, the typical adjustment at the top and at the bottom 
which requires a great deal of command supervision in terms of bringing 
these people and assimilating them into the units.

In the sixth month, they have individual training, crew training, 
team training, squad-level training, and begin platoon training. A 
small core of their personnel at the top actually have to deploy back 
to Iraq or Afghanistan for 10-day reconnaissance.

In the seventh month, they have more platoon and company-level 
training, and 2 to 3 weeks out of that 1 month are out in the field.

In the eighth month, they have command and control exercises. They 
have units beginning to report their readiness status to the Department 
of the Army. They do collective training, just below the battalion 
level. And 2 to 3 weeks, again, out of that month are in the field.

In the ninth month, they start shipping equipment, which is a 24/7 
process, shipping equipment to a national training center, shipping 
equipment back to


theater. The 10th month, they have rehearsal exercises, brigade and 
battalion level. These are 3 to 4 weeks out of that one month where 
they--and at this point these units are approximately 75 percent full 
strength. So what happens then? You have a unit which is 75 percent 
full strength which is going to deploy, and they start bringing people 
in. They call it backfill. It is also predominant in the Marine Corps. 
They start bringing people in who have been home, in many cases, less 
than even the people in this unit.


The 11th month, you have the advanced party personnel leaving, 
packing their gear and going. You have your final personnel being 
selected. You go back to individual training, major equipment systems 
returning to the unit, inspected, packed, and shipped to theater.

The 12th month, you activate rear detachments, you assimilate your 
final replacements, and you deploy.

So that is the year, which is called dwell time after a 15-month 
deployment. Obviously, what occurs after that 12-month cycle of dwell 
time is another combat deployment.

So that is the situation we are addressing. That is the situation 
that, in my view, we need to bring the Congress in as a referee. Why? I 
will give you one example. When the Chief of Staff of the Army called 
me to tell me they were going to 15-month deployment cycles several 
months ago, moving from 12- to 15-month deployment cycles, I was 
stunned. I said: How can you do this? How can you not stand up and 
resist the notion that your troops are going to be deployed for 15 
months with only 12 months at home? He said: Senator, I only feed the 
strategy; I don't make the strategy. Yet when we had General Petraeus 
before the Armed Services Committee and Senator Nelson of Florida asked 
him about this dwell-time problem, he basically said: Talk to the Chief 
of Staff of the Army. He is the person who gives us our people.

So when you have that kind of a situation, and this sort of activity 
that goes on when people are arguably out of theater, we need a result. 
We need a resolution. We need people who are going to stand up and say, 
basically, however long you have been gone, you get that much back.

I yield the floor.
