`Mr. POE â€” 24 May 2007`

Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, this Memorial Day, we honor the warriors of 
America whose lives were taken in their youth for their country's 
future. In Southeast Texas, 18 of these men have been killed in Iraq in 
sacrifice and service for the rest of us. One of those was 20 year old 
Lance Corporal Anthony Aguirre of Channelview, Texas.

While on patrol with 20 other Marines in the desert sands of Al Anbar 
Province, Lance Corporal Aguirre stepped on an improvised explosive 
device. Since America's enemies hide in caves and won't face off with 
our troops, these cowards of the desert use these explosives to kill 
Americans. Rather than immediately jump off the IED, however, Aguirre 
stood firm and told his fellow Marines to clear the area. When his 
buddies were safe, he took his foot off the bomb. He died so others 
could live. Amazing men, these young Marines of the United States 
Marine Corps.

Later, as the funeral procession passed through the streets of 
Channelview, the crowds, estimated at 8,000, waved flags and stood in 
silence along the rural roads for this Son of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, Lance Corporal Aguirre and his fallen comrades are why 
we have Memorial Day.

And that's just the way it is.
