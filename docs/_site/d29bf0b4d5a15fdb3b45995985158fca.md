Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the aviators and 
sailors from Strike Fighter Squadron VFA 14 and VFA 41 along with the 
Fleet Readiness Center West Sea Detachment Personnel and the staff of 
the Carrier Air Wing 11, all of Naval Air Station, Lemoore in my 
district in California who returned home safely this past weekend after 
a 6-month deployment aboard the USS Nimitz in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 
addition to combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, these units 
participated in Exercises Valiant Shield and Malabar. In all, a total 
of over 550 sailors from Naval Air Station Lemoore deployed.

Successful deployments depend not only on military skills, but also 
on support from three important groups; families, employers and the 
community. The community of Lemoore is extremely proud of its 
servicemembers and hosted a grand welcome home celebration on base to 
greet the pilots and sailors. Anxiously, children, spouses, parents, 
aunts, uncles, and friends all waited for their loved ones to arrive.

It is happy homecomings like this that remind me of how proud I am to 
represent the 20th Congressional District and remind all of us why we 
live in a free country. These men and women have made great sacrifices 
in defending our freedom. Therefore, I am pleased to extend a warm 
welcome home to these fine men and women from NAS Lemoore and very 
proud to recognize their dedicated service.
