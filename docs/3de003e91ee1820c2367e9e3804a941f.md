Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the resolution before 
us. I wish I could do so with the type of certainty that seems to 
motivate many of my colleagues on the issue. But such resolute 
certainty escapes me. I do not have a military background. In fact, few 
of us debating this resolution do.

But each of us can find generals or former generals who will support 
virtually every option we wish to put on the table. In the end, as 
legislators, we are left with our own council. Hopefully, such council 
is informed by briefings, hearings, meetings, and visits to the region.

But we cannot and should not try to place ourselves in the position 
of Commander in Chief. Our system of government wisely gives that role 
to the Chief Executive.

This is not to say, however, that we should not be having this 
discussion. Some have said that simply debating this resolution 
emboldens our enemies. Perhaps they are right, but we would not suspend 
due process in this country because it might embolden criminals. It is 
a price we are willing to pay.

Likewise, debating the merits of war is what democratic nations do. 
My own thoughts on the situation in Iraq are as follows: I have little 
confidence that a surge in troop levels will change the situation in 
Iraq in any substantive fashion. It seems clear that the violence in 
Iraq is increasingly sectarian, and inserting more troops in this 
atmosphere is unlikely to improve matters very much.

Without a more sincere commitment to step up to the plate from the 
Iraqi Government, we are unlikely to make significant progress. But 
when all is said and done, we have a Commander in Chief whom we have 
authorized to go to war.

Inserting ourselves as legislators into the chain of command by 
passing a resolution, nonbinding though it may be, that questions the 
President's decision to conduct a mission that is clearly already under 
way strikes me as folly.

I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on the resolution.
