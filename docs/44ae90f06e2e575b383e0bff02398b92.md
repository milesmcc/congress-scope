Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition not to the rule but to 
this bill.

Mr. Speaker, today will go down in history as a failed opportunity. 
For $165 billion we could begin funding a safe and responsible 
redeployment of our troops and military contractors from Iraq. Instead, 
we are giving the President a blank check . . . actually, more than he 
asked for.

Our Nation--whether through blood or treasure--cannot afford to 
continue this endless occupation of Iraq.

This bill will appropriate $165.4 billion for the Department of 
Defense. That could be a down payment on real change for Iraq--for 
reconciliation, reconstruction, and refugee resettlement.

We have spent half a trillion dollars . . . and we have lost 4,101 
troops and over 30,000 have been injured or maimed. Four million Iraqis 
have been displaced and unknown thousands have been killed.

The cost is unsustainable and we must put an immediate stop to this 
madness.

We must not cave to the demands of the White House. I urge my 
colleagues to vote against funding for the occupation.
