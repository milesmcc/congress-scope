Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my honor to rise today in special 
tribute to SCPO Daniel Healy of Exeter, NH. I am proud to recognize the 
dedication ceremony of the ''SCPO Daniel Healy USN SEAL'' Memorial 
Monument and Bridge in honor of his courageous service to the United 
States of America.

On June 28, 2005, Daniel lost his life when his helicopter was shot 
down during a rescue mission to save the lives of fellow soldiers in 
Kunar Province, Afghanistan. For his fearlessness under fire, Senior 
Chief Petty Officer Healy was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star with 
Combat ''V'' for Valor, the Purple Heart, and the Afghanistan Campaign 
Medal. In recognition of outstanding performance throughout his 
military career, Daniel was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps 
Achievement Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Meritorious 
Unit Commendation, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Good 
Conduct Medal.

On Sunday, July 19, 2009, the town of Exeter, NH, will honor Daniel 
by renaming the Guinea Road Bridge and Exeter Town Pool, in remembrance 
of his life and service. Although we can never truly do enough to honor 
his sacrifice, this bridge and monument will stand as a lasting 
testament to a dedicated individual that selflessly paid the ultimate 
sacrifice in support of his brothers in arms.

This dedication speaks volumes about Daniel's character. At a time 
when we have two wars ongoing, it is an extraordinary reminder of the 
kind of person who serves this country and commits him or herself to 
the protection of others, even until death. I am sure that Daniel would 
be the first to say that although this bridge and pool will bear his 
name, the honor truly belongs to everyone who proudly wears the uniform 
of our great Nation.

Daniel's kind and determined attitude will always be remembered by 
those who knew him and it is with the utmost respect that we remember 
his life with this entry into the official Congressional Record. On 
behalf of my wife Kathy, and myself, I want to express our deep 
gratitude and respect for a father, husband, son, brother, and true 
American hero. With this, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking 
Daniel's family for his service to the Nation and his devotion to our 
freedom.
