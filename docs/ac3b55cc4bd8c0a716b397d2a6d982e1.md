Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4156.

For the last 4 years, President Bush has demanded more and more money 
from this Congress for the war in Iraq, draining funding from domestic 
priorities in the process. And this year's just no different.

True to form, in October the President casually requested an 
additional $200 billion to continue his failed policy.

Mr. Speaker, every time I travel back to my district, constituents 
plead with me to stand up to this President and end the war. 
Fortunately for them, the days of the rubber-stamp Congress are over. 
This bill before us holds the President accountable.

The bill provides only $50 billion of the President's $200 billion 
request, which serves to meet the immediate needs of our troops 
currently deployed, while the balance is dependent upon progress in 
Iraq.

The funding is also conditioned on the redeployment of troops from 
Iraq to begin within 30 days of enactment, with a target for completion 
by December of 2008.

Passage of this bill is the first step towards forcing a change of 
course in Iraq, shifting the mission from the combat forces to a 
comprehensive strategy.

I urge all my colleagues to vote ''yes'' on H.R. 4156.
