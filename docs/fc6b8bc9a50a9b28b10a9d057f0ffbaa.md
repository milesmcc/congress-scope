Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment 
by the gentleman from Virginia. I think it is important to focus on 
this debate. There is no challenge greater than this facing America 
right now. It is vitally important that we succeed in Iraq and allow 
that nation to establish a democracy. I hear on the other side that, 
well, we have amply funded this already.

We are imposing dramatic increases in spending in thousands of other 
areas, a 56 percent increase in HIV/AIDS funding alone. What message do 
we send if we reduce spending in this area at this time? I would argue 
that whether you want out of Iraq tonight or whether you support the 
current course, it is vitally important that we send every message we 
possibly can to the Iraqi people and to our Nation that we are doing 
everything we can to support democracy.



That is what these funds are for. Of course, other funds have been 
spent, but these funds continue the effort to tell the Iraqi people we 
stand with them. These are funds for domestic purposes, for their 
security, for governance and for rule of law. I believe it is vitally 
important, indeed critically important for our Nation, that we fund 
this money now. I rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment.
