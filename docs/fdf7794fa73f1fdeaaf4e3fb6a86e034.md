Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 58, honoring a 
good friend, Muhammad Ali, on the occasion of his 65th birthday and to 
extend best wishes to him and his family. The Gentlelady from Indiana 
[Ms. Carson] is to be commended for bringing this resolution to the 
House in celebration of an icon of sportsmanship, fortitude, 
perseverance, and peace.

On November 20, 2005, I was honored to have given remarks during the 
grand opening of the Muhammad Ali Center in downtown Louisville. This 
educational and cultural center was established to give visitors a 
glimpse of Ali's life and experiences and to help inspire them to 
pursue their dreams by applying their maximum potential.

Ali is many things to many people: a world champion, an Olympian, an 
innovator, a world-class father, husband, and friend. In his 21 years 
of boxing, he won 56 fights out of 61 and is the first boxer to win the 
heavyweight championship three times. He achieved the incredible feat 
of winning an Olympic gold medal in the 1960 games at the age of 18.

However, his legendary charisma, charm, and genius did not stop in 
the ring or at press conferences. What makes him a true pioneer is the 
fact that he was principled enough to say no to the Vietnam War. The 
words he spoke in refusing the draft made a stark social commentary 
during that time and taught America a valuable way of thinking. Those 
words taught us that war should always be a last resort and that before 
we over-commit ourselves elsewhere, we must fix the problems that exist 
right at home. This philosophy has tremendous relevance to us today in 
the context of the War in Iraq. Many Americans feel that we should re-
align our priorities to address problems at home instead of fighting a 
war in Iraq.

I wish Muhammad Ali a very happy birthday. For his outstanding 
contributions to sports and sportsmanship and for the lessons on peace 
and conviction to principles that he gave the world, I sincerely thank 
him. His legacy and record of achievement have earned him the title of 
''the Greatest of All Time.'' I support this resolution.
