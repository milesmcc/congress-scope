Mrs. LOWEY. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2346, the FY09 Emergency 
Supplemental. This legislation provides the resources our military, 
diplomatic, and development personnel need to make our Nation more 
secure. I was very pleased to work in a bipartisan way with Kay 
Granger.

The Obama administration's policy to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda 
in Afghanistan and Pakistan is critical to prevent the region from 
being a base for terrorist plots against the United States and our 
allies. H.R. 2346 provides $3.8 billion for economic security 
initiatives in the region and funds our diplomatic development 
personnel and their security.

I welcome the administration's efforts to forge a lasting peace 
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. This legislation provides 
economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to the West Bank and 
Gaza to encourage stability and political moderation. It ensures that 
Hamas and other terrorist organizations do not receive taxpayer funds 
and that a potential unity government and all its ministers publicly 
recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence, and adhere to 
past agreements before receiving U.S. assistance.

H.R. 2346 also provides $470 million to help Mexico fight violent 
narcotraffickers with surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and law 
enforcement equipment, and to support rule of law programs, bringing to 
$1.17 billion the total appropriated in 2008 and 2009 for these 
purposes.

The bill meets the President's request for assistance programs and 
diplomatic operations in Iraq to ensure a smooth transition from the 
military mission to a civilian-led effort.

In addition, the bill addresses significant humanitarian and 
development priorities by providing $343 million for refugee programs 
to address the growing displacement of civilians in Pakistan and other 
countries; $836.9 million for peacekeeping; $300 million for countries 
impacted by the global financial crisis, including Haiti and Liberia; 
and $100 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria.

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
