`Mr. SMITH of Texas â€” 24 July 2008`

Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, in a blatant show of partisanship, 
the New York Times this week refused to publish an op-ed by Senator 
John McCain about Iraq just days after publishing an op-ed on the same 
subject by Senator Barack Obama. The Times' op-ed editor, a former 
staff member in the Clinton administration, said he wanted something 
from McCain that ''mirrors Senator Obama's piece.''

Instead of permitting one candidate to set the rules, maybe the Times 
should allow equal opportunity for the Presidential candidates to both 
express their views on major issues like Iraq.

The American people should demand more fairness and less favoritism 
from the New York Times. Voters deserve the highest standards of 
journalism both during this important election and afterwards.
