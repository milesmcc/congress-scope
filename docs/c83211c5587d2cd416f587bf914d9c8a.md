Mrs. HALVORSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1211, the 
Women Veterans Health Care Improvement Act.

I want to thank Ms. Herseth Sandlin for her dedication on this issue. 
As more women serve in the military, they are quickly becoming an 
important segment of VA users. Their numbers will double over the next 
2 to 4 years, and many are under the age of 40.

This presents new challenges to the VA system, which historically was 
designed to serve male veterans. Significant changes to the VA need to 
occur to properly serve all veterans.

As we heard at the VA committee roundtable on women veteran issues, 
women veterans arrive at the VA with a variety of unique challenges. 
Many women veterans do not identify themselves as veterans and seek 
care outside of the system. Some feel stigmatized and are hesitant to 
speak out. Women who have sought care at VA facilities have complained 
that staff lacks understanding of the role of women in combat.

The most pressing of these challenges relate to mental health, 
including PTSD, depression, anxiety, and behavioral issues. A 2008 VA 
study reported that 15 percent of women in Iraq and Afghanistan 
experience sexual assault or harassment, and 59 percent of these women 
were at a higher risk for mental health problems.



These are tragic numbers and we need to act immediately to address 
them. The difficulty women face in accessing the VA system and the lack 
of women-focused health care is unacceptable.

These women have sacrificed so much for our country. This bill takes 
the first step to meet these challenges and follows up on 
recommendations provided by Veterans Service Organizations by requiring 
the Secretary of the VA to study the barriers women face as they seek 
VA services.

Similarly, H.R. 1211 improves training and education for VA 
professionals to help treat women veterans. This education will help to 
address the concerns that many women veterans have that the VA doesn't 
understand their needs.

This is why I support H.R. 1211 and strongly urge my colleagues to 
vote ''yes'' on this important bill.
