`Mr. SMITH of Nebraska â€” 26 July 2007`

---


Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of 
SGT Jacob S. Schmuecker, an Atkinson, Nebraska, native who lost his 
life on July 21 in Balad, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Sergeant Schmuecker, assigned to Nebraska's National Guard's 755th 
Chemical Reconnaissance/Decontamination Company, died when his military 
vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb.

This young man represented some of the best qualities of Nebraska, 
and our State mourns his loss.

Sergeant Schmuecker has been described as ''calm, cool, and 
collected''--a man who answered the call of duty and served honorably. 
His loss will be felt not only by the men in his unit, but in Nebraska 
where he leaves behind his wife and three young children.

My prayers and condolences go out to Sergeant Schmuecker's family and 
friends who feel the loss of this brave man. He will be missed.
