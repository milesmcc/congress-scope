Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, 4 years ago today, 4 long years ago 
today, we heard ''Mission Accomplished.'' What mission? We are not even 
sure what the mission is anymore, the President has changed the mission 
so many times.

But I have to tell America the truth about this war. I sit on the 
Armed Services Committee, and I'm tired of hearing what I hear every 
hearing. What am I hearing? I'm hearing that the American military is 
strained to the breaking point. I'm hearing that 88 percent of our 
National Guard is not ready to be sent. I'm hearing that we're having 
problems with equipment. I'm hearing problems from military families. 
What I'm hearing is that at the top leadership, we have failed the 
military and we have failed the people of the United States. We need to 
get a grip on this.

The Democrats have presented the White House with a responsible exit 
from Iraq. We need leadership here. The President has failed to show 
that leadership, but the Democrats are prepared now to give that 
responsible road map out of Iraq.

I urge the President to sign this legislation.
