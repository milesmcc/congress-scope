`Mr. DUNCAN â€” 27 July 2010`

---


Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I support this 
legislation. It is a small step for fiscal conservatism. I think it is 
very unfortunate, though, that this debate comes right on the heels of 
the debate about the war supplemental, a more than $55 billion bill on 
top of the hundreds of billions we've already spent for the war in 
Afghanistan.

A columnist in today's Washington's Post said, We are wading deeper 
into a long running, morally ambiguous conflict that has virtually no 
chance of ending well.

I think it's very sad that we're talking about spending mega-billions 
more on a war that has continued for over 9 years at this point and is 
not worth one more American life.

But I commend the gentlewoman from Colorado for bringing this 
legislation to the floor. As I said earlier, it's unfortunate that in 
the way we do the Federal accounting this will not reduce the deficit, 
but it is a step in the right direction, and we need to go further and 
actually cut total Federal spending by the $713 million that 
procedurally we are saving here in this bill.

I yield back the balance of my time.
