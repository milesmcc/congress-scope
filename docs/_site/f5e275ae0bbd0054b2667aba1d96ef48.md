Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes.

Mr. Chairman, the process that we've gone through to bring this bill 
to the floor has been an extensive one. We started under the leadership 
of Chairman Skelton in January, and as we moved through the days and 
the weeks, there were numerous, both full committee and subcommittee 
hearings.

There were visits here on Capitol Hill in our office and in other 
places by military leaders. There were visits by us to the Pentagon and 
to bases around the continental United States and, I might add, there 
were visits by us to our soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors who are 
serving overseas.

There were briefings too numerous to count, and a good process. And I 
want to just take this opportunity to congratulate and thank Chairman 
Skelton for the orderliness and the fairness with which this process 
was conducted.

This is a good bill, and I intend to support it. It provides for some 
new things, provides for some force protection measures that are so 
important in the war that we're now engaged in. It provides for 
additional money for the Stryker system. It provides for additional 
resources for up-armored Humvees, and it provides for steps forward in 
the new Joint Tactical Vehicle program.

We added 10 more aircraft known as C-17s, which are strategic 
airlifters to get us to the fight. We took care of some personnel 
issues, including a significant pay raise for military personnel. And, 
because we're at war, and because we're using our military equipment, 
it wears out. It's a tough terrain that we're involved in in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and so we included $3.6 billion for Army reset and $8.2 
billion for Marine Corps reset.

And I might add that quality of life remains extremely important to 
the chairman, to the ranking member, and to all of us who serve on the 
committee, and so military construction dollars were added to provide 
the quality of life that is important to our military personnel.

Now, it's a good bill, and I'm going to support it. If I were the 
person sitting at the desk writing the bill all by myself, I would have 
done some things differently. But that being said, it continues to be a 
bill that is worthy of everyone's support.

I would have tried to find a way to include more money for the Future 
Combat System. We cut it by almost 25 percent. This is the Army's 
modernization program, and the first modernization program anything 
like it since World War II. It combines the use of technology that's 
available today with


some more traditional combat equipment, but it's good for the future. 
It's good for urban combat, it's good for being able to see the enemy 
who now has found ways to hide on our conventional systems. And it's a 
big cut.



I would have also tried to add back the 9 percent that was reduced 
from the missile defense system. Today we have a missile defense system 
that actually will work once it is deployed, but we reduced it by 9 
percent.

So, Mr. Chairman, once again I hope that the majority of our 
colleagues on this side of the aisle will support this bill. I think it 
is a good bill. It is one that is needed, particularly in these times 
when the United States of America is at war.

Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
