# DO NOT ABANDON POLAND MISSILE SHIELD

Mr. KIRK. History is not kind to leaders who sacrifice our Polish 
allies. News reports indicate that our administration will end plans to 
build the long-planned American missile defense site for Poland. That 
site, carefully picked by the Pentagon, is directly


under the flight path an Iranian missile would take if shot at the 
American people.

The U.N. reports that Iran has accelerated its production of uranium. 
And last February, Iran became the first new nation to orbit a 
satellite when its newest and most powerful missile worked. Iran, a 
state sponsor of terror, now makes the longest range missile of the 
terrorist world.

The administration's decision is particularly ironic because Poland 
just announced it would be sending more troops to serve alongside 
Americans in Afghanistan. America is going to let Poland down, sending 
a message of weakness to our Polish allies and the people building 
Iran's new missile arsenal.
