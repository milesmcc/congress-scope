Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, it is with the greatest sense of pride 
that I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Marine Corps Corporal 
Paul Brodner, Jr. and Sergeant Andrew Lowe. Corporal Brodner and 
Sergeant Lowe, both constituents of mine from El Cajon, California, 
recently returned from a seven month deployment to Haditha, Iraq, with 
Company E of the Second Battalion, Third Marine Regiment.

Immediately upon arrival in Haditha, which had a reputation as one of 
the most dangerous locations within Al Anbar Province and all of Iraq, 
Corporal Brodner and Sergeant Lowe's patrol were targeted and attacked 
by Sunni insurgents. For Marines in Iraq, especially those serving in 
Al Anbar, small arms and sniper fire, grenades and improvised explosive 
devices are a daily threat that challenge mission objectives and 
personal safety.

The Sunni insurgency in Haditha, at its strength, initiated a 
campaign of murder and intimidation. Despite being a hotbed of such 
activity, Marine units in Haditha launched a successful 
counterinsurgency operation that ultimately restored control of the 
city's infrastructure and resources to local officials and workers, and 
suppressed the sense of fear that was preventing Iraqis from joining 
police and security forces.

By the end of Corporal Brodner and Sergeant Lowe's deployment, 
Haditha's police force exceeded 200 volunteers and began conducting 
security operations independently of the Marines--who also began 
receiving regular intelligence reports on insurgent activity from city 
residents. Progress in Haditha became measurable, especially as attacks 
against Iraqi and coalition forces decreased from an average of ten per 
day to only a handful each month. Today, Marines and Iraqi soldiers are 
serving side-by-side and, most importantly, our Marines continue to 
provide Iraq's security forces with the training and techniques they 
will need to protect their government and its people.

It is without question that the service men and women who have served 
in Iraq have demonstrated absolute selflessness and courage. In fact, I 
am reminded of a recent conversation I had with a Marine leader 
regarding our efforts in Iraq, particularly the progress of our Marines 
in Al Anbar Province. The message relayed to me was, ''We are crushing 
the enemy in Al Anbar.''

Madam Speaker, this continued success in Al Anbar would not be 
possible without the dedication and commitment of Americans like 
Corporal Brodner and Sergeant Lowe. Their


service and contributions deserve to be recognized and commended, and I 
hope my colleagues will join me today in honoring these two American 
heroes.
