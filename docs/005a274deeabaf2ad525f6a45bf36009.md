# ORDER OF PROCEDURE
## `005a274deeabaf2ad525f6a45bf36009`
`Mr. REID â€” 6 February 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, very quickly--I know the hour is late--I 
spoke to Speaker Pelosi a couple of hours ago. Next week, the House is 
going to take up the Iraq situation. The legislation they will deal 
with, I have been told by the Speaker, is whether the House of 
Representatives will support the surge, the escalation in Iraq. They 
will finish that next week, and we will get it then, and it will be 
very direct and to the point.
