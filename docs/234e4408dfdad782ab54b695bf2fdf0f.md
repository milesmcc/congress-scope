Mr. ALEXANDER. That is my understanding as well. Senator Grassley 
still has an amendment about which he


wants us to talk. That is the only other amendment I know about, other 
than the one you said. It is my hope we could follow the schedule the 
Senator from New Mexico suggested and finish the bill before 4 o'clock. 
I think that would be the sentiment of most Senators to whom I talked. 
It will permit us to move promptly to the business before us concerning 
Iraq.

I concur in the comments of Senator Bingaman. I hope by now we have 
had such extensive participation in this legislation over the last 2 
years that everyone believes he or she has had a good hearing. The 
Coburn amendments and Inhofe amendment are the only ones I know about 
for sure. They are scheduled, or will be, and we will have to talk with 
Senator Grassley about his proposal.
