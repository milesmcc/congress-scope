Mr. COHEN. I thank the chairman.

Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise in support of this bill. It is the bill 
that I heard most about when I campaigned.

Crime is the number one issue in Memphis, Tennessee, and I think it 
is the number one issue in most areas in this country. I spoke with the 
Afro-American Police Association, and the issue they raised to me was 
the COPS Program, that community policing works.

I spoke with people in the district and they knew that the COPS 
Program had been successful, that it worked with community policing, 
and they knew it had been cut by this Congress and they couldn't 
understand why, and I couldn't tell them. I told them I was going to 
come to Congress and do what I could to see that the COPS program was 
reimplemented, that it was funded in a proper fashion, and that it 
helped cut crime.

In this bill we have an opportunity to work together to bring our 
troops home and to support our troops because veterans from Afghanistan 
and Iraq will be given priorities when feasible to get these positions, 
to come back and render their abilities and their experience for our 
people rather than the people of Baghdad.

Support our troops, support the COPS Program and make our streets 
safer.
