Mr. BOREN. Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to thank the men and 
women of the Oklahoma National Guard and their family members for their 
service and sacrifice since September 11, 2001.

I also wish members of the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team well as 
they prepare to deploy to Afghanistan early next year. May they stay 
safe during this vitally important mission, and we pray for their safe 
and speedy return home.

I urge adoption of this resolution.

I yield back the balance of my time.
