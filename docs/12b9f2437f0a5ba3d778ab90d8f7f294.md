Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to my good personal 
friend and colleague from Florida, if we want to solve this and other 
problems, we have to have some genuine bipartisanship, and that 
bipartisanship has to start at the top. There has to be an atmosphere 
of mutual respect and willingness to work together, and it has to start 
in the White House.

I have shared these comments publicly and privately. Whenever you 
face something as contentious as the matters we face--matters of war 
and peace, the making of Medicare financially solvent, the question of 
prescription drugs and their cost--you simply can't do it by taking a 
unilateral position over and over on either side of this aisle; it has 
to be that people have to come together and work it out. There also has 
to be a sense of mutual trust, of people telling the truth to each 
other, of doing what the standards were in the old days where a man's 
word was his bond. Until we get that, we are going to continue to have 
difficulty.

We see the problems right now in a war that is certainly a difficult 
one. We all share the same goal: that the interests of America are 
furthered if we can stabilize Iraq. How do we get there? There has been 
so much mistrust and suspicion that has been bred because of all the 
inconsistencies and lack of information and misinformation and massaged 
information. But that is then; now is now. What do we do? Thus far, it 
looks as though the White House and the leadership in Congress can't 
come together. There is too much distrust.

I have said before and I will say again, thank goodness the Secretary 
of State is out on a new diplomatic initiative. It is not catty to say 
it is about time, because there certainly have been those forces within 
the administration that have wanted this much more in the past, but I 
think the Secretary of State is making a very valiant effort now, 
because you are not going to solve the problem in Iraq unless you can 
get all the neighbors in the region involved to make a political 
solution stick.


Is a political solution viable? This Senator cannot say at this point 
that it is a viable prospect because of the sectarian hatred we have 
seen play out over these last several months. But this hasn't just been 
going on for months; this has been going on for 1,327 years, ever since 
the Battle of Karbala. I say to my colleague, who is my friend, and the 
two of us work together very well all the time, that a lot less 
rhetoric coming from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue would help this


problem, but I don't see it changing right now. I think that is a sad 
commentary on the state of affairs.
