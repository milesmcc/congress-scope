Mr. SALAZAR. But is this the actual, is this an actual true 
reflection of what the war in Iraq has cost? For example, we see that 
our troop levels, our military armor, and the equipment that our troops 
have is not adequate in many cases. So are we actually spending from 
other sources as well to supplement this?
