Mr. MEEK of Florida. I just want to make sure we don't leave anyone 
out. We have House Resolution 15, also expresses the sense of Congress 
and also immediate repeal which is done by Congresswoman Sheila 
Jackson-Lee. We have also ours truly, Congressman Larson, John B. 
Larson, repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Forces Against 
Iraq Resolution. You have Representative Ellen Tauscher.
