# UNITES STATES POLICY IN IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2007--S. J. RES. 9
## `bed52ffaa5d4ded82b734aa8c68cd075`
`Mr. ENSIGN â€” 15 March 2007`

---


Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about S.J. 
Res. 9 and the consequences of failure in Iraq.

I want to begin by reviewing just how Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida 
see themselves achieving ultimate victory in Iraq.

You don't have to be a serious student of history to realize that as 
of late, America has not exactly demonstrated the kind of collective 
will necessary to successfully complete military missions abroad.

As a nation, it seems easy, maybe too easy, to commit ourselves, 
through our military, into foreign lands in an attempt to accomplish 
what we believe is right, either to protect our vital national 
interests or to free a people from bondage, or in the case of Iraq to 
try to accomplish both.

Whatever the reason for committing ourselves to a noble cause 
overseas, America ventures into another country with only the best of 
intentions, and for a while the American people and her politicians 
overwhelmingly support our military and its mission.

Then, when we see that victory is not as easy or as immediate as we 
had initially hoped, we start down a road of self doubt. We convince 
ourselves that our military mission was probably not all that important 
in the first place. We somehow twist our values to accommodate an 
opinion that our military expedition is not worth the effort we need to 
expend in order to be successful. We recoil once the realization hits 
us that lives and treasure are the ''coin of the realm'' when it comes 
to using our military to ensure our continued national security. And 
for too long our adversaries have witnessed this reluctance, this lack 
of will, to finish the task at hand. In 1982, America deployed her 
military to separate warring factions in Lebanon. We went in with only 
the best of intentions. People were being killed and it was up to us to 
''do something'' about it.

Then, on October 23, 1983, two truckbombs detonated in buildings 
housing American forces in downtown Beirut. Two hundered forty-one U.S. 
marines, sailors, and soldiers lost their lives that day. Six months 
later, America had had enough and we were out of Beirut.

The Lebanese civil war would rage on for another decade, and during 
that time countless Lebanese, Palestinians, and Israelis would suffer 
as a result of our abdication of responsibility.

As had always been the case before, our adversaries did not pursue us 
back to our shores to do us harm. But they did observe and they did 
note that the American public, led by her elected officials took the 
easy way out and departed before completing our intended mission.

In 1993, the United States once again sought to ''do something'' to 
end a humanitarian crisis that was taking place on the African 
continent. In a country with no functioning central government, 
warlords ruled their individual pieces of territory within Somalia as 
personal fiefdoms.

The Somali people were fodder as the warlords battled each other for 
control of land and resources. People were being killed. If they were 
not being killed by bullets, they were being starved to death.

Although the situation in Somalia did not directly affect our 
national security, American leaders at that time answered the call to 
''do something'' to alleviate the human suffering Americans were 
witnessing nightly as part of their television news shows and reading 
in the daily editorial columns of most big city newspapers.

Our leaders once again answered the call by sending our young men and 
women in uniform to a foreign land to ''fix things.'' Soon, our 
military had its mission expanded beyond providing humanitarian 
assistance.

Part of this new mission involved capturing and/or killing the Somali 
warlords responsible for the pain inflicted on their fellow citizens. 
As part of this new mission, Army Rangers conducted an assault on 
Somali forces in what has come to be known as the ''Black Hawk Down'' 
incident.

Here, two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and 19 of our Rangers 
killed. In the days following, film footage was broadcast over and over 
again on television that showed the lifeless bodies of our soldiers 
being desecrated as they were dragged through the streets.

This footage both shocked and humbled us. The support for our mission 
to do good things in Somalia quickly evaporated. The costs had become 
too great to bear. It was no longer that important to do the right 
thing and we subsequently withdrew our forces from the region.

Once again, our adversaries watched as the world's superpower 
retreated from the fight. Today, Somalia continues to flounder as a 
failed state and a haven for Islamic radicalism on the eastern coast of 
Africa.

In a 1998 interview with ABC's John Miller, Osama bin Laden said that 
the Clinton administration's decision to withdraw from Somalia had 
emboldened his burgeoning al-Qaida force and encouraged him to plan new 
attacks.

''Our people realize[d] more than before that the American soldier is 
a paper tiger that run[s] in defeat after a few blows,'' the terror 
chief recalled. ''America forgot all about the hoopla and media 
propaganda and left dragging their corpses and their shameful defeat.''

And those attacks promised by bin Laden did come.

On August 7, 1998, al-Qaida decided to test our mettle by 
simultaneously bombing our Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and in the 
process killed 257 people and wounded over 4,000.

Our tepid response once again gave Osama bin Laden comfort.

Since the Clinton administration had chosen to treat terrorist 
attacks as law enforcement matters, America sought to prosecute in our 
courts those responsible. Osama bin Laden was soon placed atop the 
FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.

Along with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 1996 Khobar 
Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in 
Yemen, the Embassy bombing were two of the major anti-American 
terrorist attacks that preceded 9/11.

The United States responded to the Embassy attacks by freezing 
financial


assets of related parties and by firing some missiles into al-Qaida 
training camps in Afghanistan.

The attack in Afghanistan destroyed some physical targets. However, 
the operation did not accomplish the destruction of bin Laden and his 
operatives and did not lead to any significant changes in the al-Qaida 
network and leadership.

Al-Qaida grew bolder, stronger, and more capable as we sat on our 
hands.

And so, here we are today, facing an embolden enemy bent on our 
destruction who has convinced himself that he possesses the will to 
break our spirit. He has done it before and he is convinced he can do 
it again this time.

The sad part about all this is that Osama bin Laden may very well be 
right this time.

Today we stand here debating a resolution of appeasement that 
directly affects our military strategy in Iraq and, by default, our 
overall national security for years to come.

This resolution calls for imposing an artificial timeline to withdraw 
our troops from Iraq, regardless of the conditions on the ground or the 
consequences of defeat; a defeat that will surely be added to what is 
unfortunately a growing list of American humiliations.

I agree with the President's assessment that this legislation before 
us would hobble American commanders in the field and substantially 
endanger America's strategic objective of a unified federal democratic 
Iraq that can govern, defend, and sustain itself and be an ally in the 
war against Islamic fascism.

The unintended consequence of this resolution is to bring to reality 
Osama bin Laden's vision for Iraq; that after 4 years of fighting in 
Iraq the U.S. Congress loses its will to fight. We precipitously 
withdraw our forces and leave the fledgling Iraqi government to fend 
for itself; Sunni and Shia factions rip the nation apart at a scale 
previously unimaginable. There is a mass exodus of refugees out of 
Iraq, and no mechanism in place to deal with them. Iran, Syria, Saudi 
Arabia and other states in the region feel the need to get involved.

This is a terrible scenario, but it is not the worst of scenarios. 
Bin Laden's nightmare vision also involves a chaotic Iraq with Sunni 
dominated areas like al-Anbar Province becoming a safe haven from which 
al-Qaida can launch attacks against the United States.

And we could see the Shiite dominated areas, with the help of Iran, 
and its own oil wealth, be used as a terrorist breeding ground, as 
well.

Make no mistake. The Iraqi situation is vastly different from Beirut, 
different from Somalia, and, different from the bombing of our African 
Embassies.

Iraq has consequences that will surely be felt here at home and 
around the world. If we leave Iraq before the job is done, as surely as 
night follows day, the terrorists will follow us home.

I believe this.

We will be sorry and we will regret having once again left unfinished 
our national security obligations. But by then it will be too late for 
regrets.

We will find that as strong and powerful and compassionate as we 
think we are, we cannot ''unring'' the bell. The damage will have been 
done.

Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida followers are convinced that America 
is weak and decadent and they can succeed in grinding down our resolve 
and forcing us to retreat.

Osama bin Laden has openly said: America does not have the stomach to 
stay in the fight.

He is a murderer. He is a fanatic. He is an Islamic fascist. He is 
determined to destroy us and our way of life.

Let us resolve today not to also make him a prognosticator of things 
to come.

I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided legislation. We cannot 
afford to leave this fight at this time. For the sake of America's 
future, we cannot afford to fail.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
