Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in strong support of H.R. 6058, the 
Wounded Warrior and Military Survivor Housing Assistance Act, and I 
also want to thank my freshman colleague for offering his support of 
this measure and cosponsorship as well.

A few weeks ago, I had the unfortunate honor of meeting the widow of 
a serviceman who had graduated from high school in my hometown of Eden 
Prairie and someone who had served in Afghanistan. And since she was in 
Washington, D.C. for her husband's burial at Arlington National 
Cemetery, she'd asked to come and meet with me so she could share some 
of the challenges that she was facing in the midst of her crisis. She 
had an exhaustive list of concerns, actually, that she was trying to 
juggle through in the midst of the ceremony taking place for her 
husband.

At the top of her list, the top priority was essentially wondering 
how she was going to be able to pay her mortgage now that the family 
was no longer receiving any income, and the monthly burden of her 
mortgage was something she had never really had to think about during 
her husband's entire military career, which had gone on for a long 
time.


While there are certainly many current provisions in law that try to 
help people remain in their homes when they come upon some difficult 
financial problems, I believe that these programs should take into 
account the special needs of survivors, of dependents, and those with 
service-connected injuries. That is why I introduced the legislation, 
the Wounded Warrior and Military Survivor Housing Act with Mr. Minnick. 
This legislation directs the Secretaries of HUD and the VA to make sure 
that their housing programs do indeed address the needs of survivors 
and dependents as well as those who have those service-related 
injuries.

Mr. Speaker, these are families that have made great sacrifices. 
These are families that have basically allowed the rest of us to enjoy, 
and all Americans to enjoy, the freedoms that we have, more freedoms 
that are unprecedented ever in human history. The least we can do, I 
think, is recognize those special needs and make sure that we are 
giving them tools to help them adjust to the changes now that have 
taken place in their lives.

Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate support for the legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the ranking 
member of the committee, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus).
