Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, today Republicans in Congress ignored 
the will of the American people and rubber-stamped the President's veto 
of important funding for our domestic priorities. After 7 years of 
unrestrained spending and a ballooning deficit, the President and his 
Republican allies in Congress have, under the guise of fiscal 
responsibility, rejected a $6.2 billion funding increase


for education, health care, and workforce development, even as the 
President requests nearly $200 billion in unbudgeted, no strings 
attached funding to continue the Iraq War for another year. That is no 
way to balance America's checkbook.

Under the budget passed by the New Democratic Congress, we can take 
care of America at home--increase funding for our schools, offer more 
student assistance for college, invest in biomedical research at NIH, 
expand health care access, and help Americans compete in the global 
economy--and balance the budget by 2012. These priorities are America's 
priorities, and Democrats in Congress will continue to fight for them.
