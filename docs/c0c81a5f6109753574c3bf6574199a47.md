Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago, President 
Kennedy compelled the Soviet Union to remove offensive missiles from 
Cuba without a shot being fired. The Soviet missiles represented a true 
threat, but President Kennedy knew that the consequences of war were 
severe and that there was a viable option short of direct military 
confrontation.

The Iranian threat, while certainly a continuing and growing concern, 
cannot be compared to the danger of Soviet efforts during the Cold War. 
The President's perceived rush toward the possibility of military 
conflict with Iran highlights the executive's inability to find real 
solutions to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons or 
supplying weapons to our adversaries in Iraq. We must exhaust every 
economic and diplomatic opportunity before even considering a military 
response.

This administration has reduced our leverage around the world, but 
there is still time to build an international consensus around this 
issue. Congress has a constitutional responsibility in this debate. I 
hope Members will urge the President to take the moral high ground and 
deal with Iran through


international pressure, not unilateral action.
