`Mr. HENSARLING â€” 10 May 2007`

---


Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this 
rule. What happened to the most open and transparent and fair process 
that was supposed to occur in the history of Congress? We have a closed 
rule on top of a closed rule on top of a closed rule.

And now what we see is, yet again, the Democrats bringing a bill to 
the floor that our Secretary of Defense says is even worse than the 
last one they brought to the floor as far as tying the hands of our 
troops as they attempt to protect our freedom.

Once again we have a slow-bleed strategy for our troops in Iraq. Once 
again we still have a pork-laden supplemental.

Let's talk for a second about the ag bill. Now there is legitimate 
debate, and there may be legitimate reasons, and I agree that drought 
assistance may be necessary in certain parts of the country. But this 
is supposedly the PAYGO Congress? I have looked at this. Number one, 
where is the emergency? The drought took place last year. That is when 
the emergency was. Why isn't this going in regular order? Where is the 
offset?

Had there been an open rule, I would have been happy to offer an 
offset amendment. Once again, I don't know how anyone on this side of 
the aisle, Mr. Speaker, can call this the PAYGO Congress. There are so 
many holes in this PAYGO it looks beyond Swiss cheese. This is one of 
the worse rules that I have seen brought to the floor, and every Member 
should rise in opposition and defeat this rule.
