Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment says within 45 days that we 
should have testimony from our military leaders, whom we have given the 
responsibility for combat operations in Afghanistan.

We have just abrogated the Senate's obligations and constitutional 
authority for advice and consent, because now, thanks to the passage of 
the Levin amendment, we will not have testimony from those commanders 
in the field. I take special exception to it, and so should most people 
who have their young citizens over there in harm's way today fighting 
and dying.

What we are going to do is say we cannot have any hearing as regards 
to strategy concerning how we are going to succeed in Afghanistan. So 
we are not in on the takeoff, and a lot of us may have trouble being in 
on the landing. This is an issue regarding which the Senate should have 
a role--at least of being informed.

I guess maybe we will be restricted to interviews with General 
McChrystal on ''60 Minutes.'' I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
the amendment.
