# ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008-- MOTION TO PROCEED
## `0dd23504cbb62d7f274fa19425a0eddc`
`Mr. DODD â€” 16 November 2007`

---


Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at the request of the distinguished majority


leader, and as the only Democrat who voted against cloture on the 
motion to proceed to H.R. 4156, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq 
redeployment Appropriations Bill, I have entered this motion to 
reconsider so that the Senate may have another opportunity to vote on 
this matter. Only Senators who voted no on this matter are able under 
Senate rules to ask for another vote.

I am undertaking this procedural matter at the Leader's request and 
out of my respect for him. I am happy to do so.

However, I want to make clear that should there be another cloture 
vote on H.R. 4156 or similar legislation, my position will remain the 
same--I will vote no. I am opposed to providing any additional funding 
for the war in Iraq unless there is a firm and enforceable deadline for 
the redeployment of our forces from Iraq.

My views on the ongoing failed policy in Iraq are included in the 
Record earlier in the day at the time of the original vote and I urge 
my colleagues to take the opportunity to review my concerns about our 
continued involvement in a civil war which has no military solutions.
