Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.

I thank the gentleman for his agreement with us on this issue, where 
we had a process set up. The process was set up by the Secretary in 
conformance with the President's wishes, and the thing that they 
thought was very important was having the input from those who would be 
most affected.

In talking to the Chiefs yesterday, one of them made the comment to 
me, in addition to the letters, he says, Hey, I understand the 
politics. I understand what's going on here. And he said, The amendment 
is very cleverly written. It says nothing will be done to implement 
this until the study is done. However, the headline will be ''Don't 
Ask, Don't Tell Repealed.'' He says, I understand how that works. But 
the guy that's out on an FOB in Afghanistan is going to get the 
headline and he is going to then, when somebody may send him a survey, 
he is going to say, What is this? I know this is already decided. I 
mean, we ought to treat this like it really is.

Many of your Members, I have been on the floor the whole day, I have 
listened to this debate, and I was also in the Rules Committee 
yesterday and heard it, and many of your Members say this repeals Don't 
Ask, Don't Tell. This is it. And then some of your Members are saying, 
Well, it doesn't really do anything. It just kind of moves the ball 
down the field. Then why are we doing the debate? I think be honest in 
what this really does. This precludes the study, the study we just 
hired that we are going to pay good money for and we are going to hear 
from the troops, but they are going to know that their wishes or their 
desires or their comments or their participation is folly because the 
decision's already made.

What it's supposed to be was we found out, we went out and did the 
study, then it comes back and came to us with the Chief's and the 
Secretary's recommendations, and then we do have a responsibility here. 
We do pass the laws. And we are giving up that responsibility today by 
voting on something without the complete information. And we're dissing 
the troops. That's what we're doing. We're disrespecting them.

And as some of the chairmen said to me yesterday, it's going to cause 
confusion in the force, and we don't keep faith with those who are 
putting their lives on the line every day for us. And especially this 
committee. This committee should stand for the force. This committee 
should stand for the troops. This should have been discussed in our 
committee before it came to the full floor.

I yield back the balance of my time.
