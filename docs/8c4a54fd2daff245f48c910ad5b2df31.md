Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Speaker, some 6,000 miles from here a new plan is underway to 
secure Baghdad and stabilize an Iraq that 2 months ago was sliding into 
chaos. Indeed, we should be encouraged by declining levels of violence 
in Baghdad as well as the beginning of a restoration of trust between 
ordinary Iraqis and coalition and Iraqi forces.

Unlike the gentleman before me, I disagree that this sends the right 
message. This supplemental undermines General Petraeus' plan before our 
troops have an opportunity to achieve success.

Instead of reaffirming our commitment to victory, this bill concedes 
defeat while piling on billions in unrelated pork. So while tropical 
fish get $5 million, our troops get a steady Democratic diet of 
limitations and pull-out deadlines. We should have few doubts that, if 
passed, this bill will be a rallying cry for terrorists recently 
dismayed by our resolve.

Our troops march to the order of one Commander in Chief, not 535. 
While the current Commander in Chief has a plan for victory, it is 
apparent that the majority party in this House has already thrown in 
the towel.
