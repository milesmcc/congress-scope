# AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND  RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008

Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this 
amendment.

Research funded by this program has provided blast-proof wood hybrid 
materials to the Coast Guard and the Army to strengthen their 
facilities. In fact, some wood composites engineered by the University 
of Maine and developed by research conducted under this grant program 
are being used by the Army Corps of Engineers in Iraq, Afghanistan and 
worldwide.

This funding will allow the University of Maine to continue its 
strong support of traditional wood products production and enhance the 
competitiveness of our domestic industry.

I strongly oppose this amendment, and I would add simply that I don't 
know of any program that spins off more small businesses than this wood 
composite program at the University of Maine.
