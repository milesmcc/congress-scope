Mr. KUCINICH. Wake up, America. WikiLeaks' release of secret war 
documents gave us 92,000 reasons to end the wars. Pick one.

Wake up, America. Main Street is falling apart, businesses have 
closed, bankruptcies abound, people are losing their jobs, their homes, 
losing their retirement security, the middle class is falling apart, 
workers' rights are not being protected, the government's out of money. 
There's not even money for childhood nutrition.

Wake up, America. There's unlimited money for war, money for a 
corrupt government in Afghanistan. When U.S. money is not going to the 
Karzai mob's personal use, it goes to help the Taliban kill our troops. 
There's money for a corrupt government in Pakistan, which helps the 
Taliban in Afghanistan kill our troops. Meanwhile, our troops are 
committing suicide in record numbers.

Wake up, America. How can we solve the world's problems if we can't 
solve our own problems here at home?
