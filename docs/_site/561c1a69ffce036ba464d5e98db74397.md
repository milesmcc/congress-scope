Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, every parent, every parent, whether living 
in the United States or in Iraq, wants only the best for their 
children. They want their kids to feel safe and to have the very best 
of everything. And every parent wants their child to get a quality 
education.

Worldwide over 100 million children do not attend school. 
Unfortunately, the trends of school attendance in Iraq are very 
discouraging. According to recent UNICEF reports, high levels of street 
violence and lawlessness are keeping school attendance levels, 
particularly of girls, to low levels.

Often because families can no longer afford to keep their children in 
school, girls are pulled out to assist their families with household 
work and to look after younger siblings while their brothers finish 
school.

The large refugee crisis is another impediment to education. UNHCR 
estimates that 500,000 school-age Iraqi children now live in 
neighboring countries. This could put a severe strain on neighboring 
countries' schools and their school systems, that is, if children are 
even allowed to attend school while living as a refugee. Additionally, 
refugee families often do not have money for tuition, and refugee 
children may not speak the local language.

This summer, the United Nations launched a global appeal for $129 
million to get more Iraqi refugee children into schools. This is just a 
Band-Aid, Mr. Speaker, on the situation.

Until Iraq is stabilized and families can return to their homes, 
we're going to have a generation of children who have lived their lives 
on the run, without feeling safe and without an education.

In a nation with a rich legacy of education, a nation that has 
produced some of the world's leading doctors, architects and artists, 
parents are watching their children denied an education? This is not 
the future we want for American children, and it is not the future we 
want for Iraqi children.

Iraqis of all ages deserve a safe and secure future and one that is 
enriched by education.

We know how to provide that future, and it's by ending the occupation 
and returning sovereignty to Iraq. If this administration would only 
listen to the Congress, or even to the Iraqi people themselves, they 
would see that there is overwhelming support to bring our troops home.

This does not mean that we would end our commitment to the Iraqi 
people. In fact, the American people have a long history of generosity 
and great humanitarian works. Our dedication to the children of Iraq 
would not end with our military presence. Iraq is only made less stable 
with an endless American occupation, and our very presence appears to 
be inspiring even more insurgents.

Let's do what is in the best interests of the United States and of 
Iraq. Let's renew our humanitarian commitment to the Iraqi people. 
Let's end this misguided occupation. Let's bring our troops and 
military contractors home.
