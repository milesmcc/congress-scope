Mr. DONNELLY. There is no question, Mr. Ross, that when we look at 
our soldiers, nothing but the best is acceptable.

As you mentioned the soldiers in your district, we just had, about 
three weeks ago, our South Bend, Indiana, National Guard unit head over 
to some of the most dangerous duty in Iraq. And, again, they went with 
their pride and with a determination to do well. And our job, my job, 
your job is to make sure they have the very, very best. And it's not 
appropriate to see money disappear, to see it wasted at the tune of 
$300,000 a month it was. To some gentleman who is making up stories in 
the back room when we think he's providing information. Our job is to 
make sure that the young men and women of Arkansas, New York, Indiana, 
Delaware, Pennsylvania and all our States have the very, very best 
armored equipment, armored vehicles. Their safety and their return home 
to their loved ones is the utmost importance.
