`Mr. KUCINICH â€” 10 March 2010`

---


Mr. KUCINICH. I yield myself 3 minutes.

One of the areas of concern that I have about our presence in 
Afghanistan that I haven't seen discussed that much deals with the role 
of oil and gas, particularly in Afghanistan. Paul Craig Roberts, who 
was an Assistant Secretary of Treasury under the Reagan administration, 
reported in November of last year on a former British ambassador to 
Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, who was fired from his job when he spoke out 
about documents he saw ''proving that the motivation for U.S. and U.K. 
military aggression in Afghanistan had something to do with the natural 
gas deposits in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.'' He continues, and these 
are his words, ''The Americans wanted a pipeline that bypassed Russia 
and Iran and went through Afghanistan. To ensure this, an invasion was 
necessary.''

I did some additional research on that and I found an article by 
Craig Murray where he claims that Mr. Karzai ''was put in place because 
of his role with Unocal in developing the Trans-Afghanistan Gas 
Pipeline project. That remains a chief strategic goal. The Asian 
Development Bank has agreed finance to start construction in spring, 
2011. It is, of course, a total coincidence that 30,000 extra U.S. 
troops will arrive 6 months before, and that the U.S. (as opposed to 
other NATO forces) deployment area corresponds with the pipeline 
route.''

I have a map of the pipeline. It's probably not easily visible, but 
it starts on the west in Turkmenistan, goes through Afghanistan, south 
to Pakistan and India, and it touches near both Helmand and Kandahar 
province, which is exactly where our troop buildup is occurring. I will 
put this article by Mr. Murray into the Record.











 Obama Is Wrong on Both Counts














 (By Craig Murray)




 Obama loves his rhetoric, and his speech on the Afghan 


 surge was topped by a rhetorical flourish:



 ''Our cause is just, our resolve unshaken''.



 He is of course wrong on both counts.



 The occupation of Afghanistan by the US and its allies is 


 there to prop up the government of President Karzai. Karzai's 


 has always been an ultra-corrupt government of vicious 


 warlords and drugs barons. I have been pointing this out for 


 years, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-469983/
Britain-protecting-biggest-heroin-crop-
time.html#ixzz0VS78HVR1



 The CIA is up to its usual tricks again supporting the drug 


 running of key warlords loyal to them. They are also setting 


 up death squads on the Central American model, in cooperation 


 with Blackwater.



 Fortunately Karzai's rigging of his re-election was so 


 blatant that the scales have fallen from the eyes of the 


 public and even the mainstream media. Politicians no longer 


 pretend we are promoting democracy in Afghanistan.



 Karzai comes directly from the Bush camp and was put in 


 place because of his role with Unocal in developing the Trans 


 Afghanistan Gas Pipeline project. That remains a chief 


 strategic goal. The Asian Development Bank has agreed finance 


 to start construction in Spring 2011. It is of course a total 


 coincidence that 30,000 extra US troops will arrive six 


 months before, and that the US (as opposed to other NATO 


 forces) deployment area corresponds with the pipeline route.



 Obama's claim that ''Our cause is just'' ultimately rests 


 on the extraordinary claim that, eight years after the 


 invasion, we are still there in self-defence. In both the UK 


 and US, governments are relying on the mantra that the 


 occupation of Afghanistan protects us from terrorism at home.



 This is utter nonsense. The large majority of post 9/11 


 terror incidents have been by Western Muslims outraged by our 


 invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Put bluntly, if we keep 


 invading Muslim countries, of course we will face a violent 


 backlash. The idea that because we occupy Afghanistan a 


 Muslim from Dewsbury or Detroit disenchanted with the West 


 would not be able to manufacture a bomb is patent nonsense. 


 It would be an infinitely better strategy to make out 


 theoretical Muslim less disenchanted by not attacking and 


 killing huge numbers of his civilian co-religionists.



 Our cause is unjust.



 We are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of 


 civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and for the further of 


 radicalisation of Muslim communities worldwide. That 


 threatens a perpetual war--which is of course just what the 


 military-industrial complex and the security industry want. 


 They have captured Obama.



 Fortunately, our resolve is shaken.



 The ordinary people of the UK and US have begun in 


 sufficient numbers to see through this perpetual war 


 confidence trick; they realise there is nothing in it for 


 them but dead youngsters and high taxes. That is why Obama 


 made a very vague promise--which I believe in its vagueness 


 and caveats to be deliberate deceit--that troops will start 


 to leave in 2011.



 Today's promises of 5,000 additional NATO troops are, 


 incidentally, empty rhetoric. I gather from friends in the 


 FCO that firm pledges to date amount to 670.



 A well-placed source close to the Taliban in Pakistan tells 


 me that the Afghan Taliban




 and their tribal allies have a plan. As the US seeks 


 massively to expand the Afghan forces, they are feeding in 


 large numbers of volunteers. I suspect that while we may see 


 the odd attack on their trainers, the vast majority will get 


 trained, fed, paid and equipped and bide their time before 


 turning en masse. This is nothing new; it is precisely the 


 history of foreign occupations in the region and the purchase 


 of tribal auxiliaries and alliances.


I will also have this article called ''Unocal and the Afghanistan 
Pipeline'' submitted in the Record because he talks about how ''Unocal 
was not interested in a partnership. The U.S. Government, its 
affiliated transnational oil and construction companies, and the ruling 
elite of the West had coveted the same oil and gas transit route for 
years.

''A trans-Afghanistan pipeline was not simply a business matter, but 
a key component of a broader geostrategic agenda: total military and 
economic control of Eurasia.'' This is supposedly described in Zbigniew 
Brzezinski's book, ''The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its 
Geostrategic Imperatives'' as ''the center of world power.''

''Capturing the region's oil wealth and carving out territory in 
order to build a network of transit routes was a primary objective of 
U.S. military interventions throughout the 1990s in the Balkans, the 
Caucasus, and Caspian Sea.''

Part One of a two-part series Players on a rigged grand chessboard: 
















Bridas,




 After the fall of the Soviet Union, Argentine oil company 


 Bridas, led by its ambitious chairman, Carlos Bulgheroni, 


 became the first company to exploit the oil fields of 


 Turkmenistan and propose a pipeline through neighboring 


 Afghanistan. A powerful US-backed consortium intent on 


 building its own pipeline through the same Afghan corridor 


 would oppose Bridas' project.












 The Coveted Trans-Afghan Route




 Upon successfully negotiating leases to explore in 


 Turkmenistan, Bridas was awarded exploration contracts for 


 the Keimar block near the Caspian Sea, and the Yashlar block 


 near the Afghanistan border. By March 1995, Bulgheroni had 


 accords with Turkmenistan and Pakistan granting Bridas 


 construction rights for a pipeline into Afghanistan, pending 


 negotiations with the civil war-torn country.



 The following year, after extensive meetings with warlords 


 throughout Afghanistan, Bridas had a 30-year agreement with 


 the Rabbani regime to build and operate an 875-mile gas 


 pipeline across Afghanistan.



 Bulgheroni believed that his pipeline would promote peace 


 as well as material wealth in the region. He approached other 


 companies, including Unocal and its then-CEO, Roger Beach, to 


 join an international consortium.



 Unocal was not interested in a partnership. The United 


 States government, its affiliated transnational oil and 


 construction companies, and the ruling elite of the West had 


 coveted the same oil and gas transit route for years.



 A trans-Afghanistan pipeline was not simply a business 


 matter, but a key component of a broader geo-strategic 


 agenda: total military and economic control of Eurasia (the 


 Middle East and former Soviet Central Asian republics). 


 Zbigniew Brezezinski describes this region in his book ''The 


 Grand Chessboard--American Primacy and Its Geostrategic 


 Imperatives'' as ''the center of world power.'' Capturing the 


 region's oil wealth, and carving out territory in order to 


 build a network of transit routes, was a primary objective of 


 US military interventions throughout the 1990s in the 


 Balkans, the Caucasus and Caspian Sea.



 As of 1992, 11 western oil companies controlled more than 


 50 percent of all oil investments in the Caspian Basin, 


 including Unocal, Amoco, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Exxon-


 Mobil, Pennzoil, Texaco, Phillips and British Petroleum.



 In ''Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in 


 Central Asia'' (a definitive work that is a primary source 


 for this report), Ahmed Rashid wrote, ''US oil companies who 


 had spearheaded the first US forays into the region wanted a 


 greater say in US policy making.''



 Business and policy planning groups active in Central Asia, 


 such as the Foreign Oil Companies Group operated with the 


 full support of the US State Department, the National 


 Security Council, the CIA and the Department of Energy and 


 Commerce.



 Among the most active operatives for US efforts: 


 Brezezinski (a consultant to Amoco, and architect of the 


 Afghan-Soviet war of the 1970s), Henry Kissinger (advisor to 


 Unocal), and Alexander Haig (a lobbyist for Turkmenistan), 


 and Dick Cheney (Halliburton, US-Azerbaijan Chamber of 


 Commerce).



 Unocal's Central Asia envoys consisted of former US defense 


 and intelligence officials. Robert Oakley, the former US 


 ambassador to Pakistan, was a ''counter-terrorism'' 


 specialist for the Reagan administration who armed and 


 trained the mujahadeen during the war against the Soviets in 


 the 1980s. He was an Iran-Contra conspirator charged by 


 Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh as a key figure involved 


 in arms shipments to Iran.



 Richard Armitage, the current Deputy Defense Secretary, was 


 another Iran-Contra player in Unocal's employ. A former Navy 


 SEAL, covert operative in Laos, director with the Carlyle 


 Group, Armitage is allegedly deeply linked to terrorist and 


 criminal networks in the Middle East, and the new independent 


 states of the former Soviet Union (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, 


 and Kyrgistan).



 Armitage was no stranger to pipelines. As a member of the 


 Burma/Myanmar Forum, a group that received major funding from 


 Unocal, Armitage was implicated in a lawsuit filed by Burmese 


 villagers who suffered human rights abuses during the 


 construction of a Unocal pipeline. (Halliburton, under Dick 


 Cheney, performed contract work on the same Burmese project.)











 Bridas Versus the New World Order




 Much to Bridas' dismay, Unocal went directly to regional 


 leaders with its own proposal. Unocal formed its own 


 competing US-led, Washington-sponsored consortium that 


 included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, aligned with Saudi Prince 


 Abdullah and King Fahd. Other partners included Russia's 


 Gazprom and Turkmenistan's state-owned Turkmenrozgas.



 John Imle, president of Unocal (and member of the US-


 Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce with Armitage, Cheney, 


 Brezezinski and other ubiquitous figures), lobbied 


 Turkmenistan's president Niyazov and prime minister Bhutto of 


 Pakistan, offering a Unocal pipeline following the same route 


 as Bridas.'



 Dazzled by the prospect of an alliance with the US, Niyazov 


 asked Bridas to renegotiate its past contract and blocked 


 Bridas' exports from Keimar field. Bridas responded by filing 


 three cases with the International Chamber of Commerce 


 against Turkmenistan for breach of contract. (Bridas won.) 


 Bridas also filed a lawsuit in Texas charging Unocal with 


 civil conspiracy and ''tortuous interference with business 


 relations.'' While its officers were negotiating with 


 Pakistani and Turkmen oil and gas officials, Bridas 


 claimed that Unocal had stolen its idea, and coerced the 


 Turkmen government into blocking Bridas from Keimir field. 


 (The suit was dismissed in 1998 by Judge Brady G. Elliott, 


 a Republican, who claimed that any dispute between Unocal 


 and Bridas was governed by the laws of Turkmenistan and 


 Afghanistan, rather than Texas law.)



 In October 1995, with neither company in a winning 


 position, Bulgheroni and Imle accompanied Niyazov to the 


 opening of the UN General Assembly. There, Niyazov awarded 


 Unocal with a contract for a 918-mile natural gas pipeline. 


 Bulgheroni was shocked. At the announcement ceremony, Unocal 


 consultant Henry Kissinger said that the deal looked like 


 ''the triumph of hope over experience.''



 Later, Unocal's consortium, CentGas, would secure another 


 contract for a companion 1,050-mile oil pipeline from 


 Dauletabad through Afghanistan that would connect to a tanker 


 loading port in Pakistan on the coast of the Arabian Sea.



 Although Unocal had agreements with the governments on 


 either end of the proposed route, Bridas still had the 


 contract with Afghanistan.



 The problem was resolved via the CIA and Pakistani ISI-


 backed Taliban. Following a visit to Kandahar by US Assistant 


 Secretary of State for South Asia Robin Raphael in the fall 


 of 1996, the Taliban entered Kabul and sent the Rabbani 


 government packing.



 Bridas' agreement with Rabbani would have to be 


 renegotiated.















 Wooing the Taliban




 According to Ahmed Rashid, ''Unocal's real influence with 


 the Taliban was that their project carried the possibility of 


 US recognition, which the Taliban were desperately anxious to 


 secure.''



 Unocal wasted no time greasing the palms of the Taliban. It 


 offered humanitarian aid to Afghan warlords who would form a 


 council to supervise the pipeline project. It provided a new 


 mobile phone network between Kabul and Kandahar. Unocal also 


 promised to help rebuild Kandahar, and donated $9,000 to the 


 University of Nebraska's Center for Afghan Studies. The US 


 State Department, through its aid organization USAID, 


 contributed significant education funding for Taliban. In the 


 spring of 1996, Unocal executives flew Uzbek leader General 


 Abdul Rashid Dostum to Dallas to discuss pipeline passage 


 through his northern (Northern Alliance-controlled) 


 territories.



 Bridas countered by forming an alliance with Ningarcho, a 


 Saudi company closely aligned with Prince Turki el-Faisal, 


 the Saudi intelligence chief. Turki was a mentor to Osama bin 


 Laden, the ally of the Taliban who was publicly feuding with 


 the Saudi royal family. As a gesture for Bridas, Prince Turki 


 provided the Taliban with communications equipment and a 


 fleet of pickup trucks. Now Bridas proposed two consortiums, 


 one to build the Afghanistan portion, and another to take 


 care of both ends of the line.




 By November 1996, Bridas claimed that it had an agreement 


 signed by the Taliban and Dostum--trumping Unocal.



 The competition between Unocal and Bridas, as described by 


 Rashid, ''began to reflect the competition within the Saudi 


 Royal family.''



 In 1997, Taliban officials traveled twice to Washington, 


 D.C. and Buenos Aires to be wined and dined by Unocal and 


 Bridas. No agreements were signed.



 It appeared to Unocal that the Taliban was balking. In 


 addition to royalties, the Taliban demanded funding for 


 infrastructure projects, including roads and power plants. 


 The Taliban also announced plans to revive the Afghan 


 National Oil Company, which had been abolished by the Soviet 


 regime in the late 1970s.



 Osama bin Laden (who issued his fatwa against the West in 


 1998) advised the Taliban to sign with Bridas. In addition to 


 offering the Taliban a higher bid, Bridas proposed an open 


 pipeline accessible to warlords and local users. Unocal's 


 pipeline was closed--for export purposes only. Bridas' plan 


 also did not require outside financing, while Unocal's 


 required a loan from the western financial institutions (the 


 World Bank), which in turn would leave Afghanistan vulnerable 


 to demands from western governments.



 Bridas' approach to business was more to the Taliban's 


 liking. Where Bulgheroni and Bridas' engineers would take the 


 time to ''sip tea with Afghan tribesmen,'' Unocal's American 


 executives issued top-down edicts from corporate headquarters 


 and the US Embassy (including a demand to open talks with the 


 CIA-backed Northern Alliance).



 While seemingly well received within Afghanistan, Bridas' 


 problems with Turkmenistan (which they blamed on Unocal and 


 US interference) had left them cash-strapped and without a 


 supply.



 In 1997, they went searching for a major partner with the 


 clout to break the deadlock with Turkmenistan. They found one 


 in Amoco. Bridas sold 60 percent of its Latin American assets 


 to Amoco. Carlos Bulgheroni and his contingent retained the 


 remaining minority 40 percent. Facilitating the merger were 


 other icons of transnational finance, Chase Manhattan 


 (representing Bridas), Morgan Stanley (handling Amoco) and 


 Arthur Andersen (facilitator of post-merger integration). 


 Zbigniew Brezezinski was a consultant for Amoco.



 (Amoco would merge with British Petroleum a year later. BP 


 is represented by the law firm of Baker & Botts, whose 


 principal attorney is James Baker, lifelong Bush friend, 


 former secretary of state, and a member of the Carlyle 


 Group.)



 Recognizing the significance of the merger, a Pakistani oil 


 company executive hinted, ''If these (Central Asian) 


 countries want a big US company involved, Amoco is far bigger 


 than Unocal.''












 Clearing the Chessboard Again




 By 1998, while the Argentine contingent made slow progress, 


 Unocal faced a number of new problems.



 Gazprom pulled out of CentGas when Russia complained about 


 the anti-Russian agenda of the US. This forced Unocal to 


 expand CentGas to include Japanese and South Korean gas 


 companies, while maintaining the dominant share with Delta. 


 Human rights groups began protesting Unocal's dealings with 


 the brutal Taliban. Still riding years of Clinton bashing and 


 scandal mongering, conservative Republicans in the US 


 attacked the Clinton administration's Central Asia policy for 


 its lack of clarity and ''leadership.''



 Once again, violence would change the dynamic.



 In response to the bombing of US embassies in Nairobi and 


 Tanzania (attributed to bin Laden), President Bill Clinton 


 sent cruise missiles into Afghanistan and Sudan. The 


 administration broke off diplomatic contact with the Taliban, 


 and UN sanctions were imposed.



 Unocal withdrew from CentGas, and informed the State 


 Department ''the gas pipeline would not proceed until an 


 internationally recognized government was in place in 


 Afghanistan.'' Although Unocal continued on and off 


 negotiations on the oil pipeline (a separate project), the 


 lack of support from Washington hampered efforts.



 Meanwhile, Bridas declared that it would not need to wait 


 for resolution of political issues, and repeated its 


 intention of moving forward with the Afghan gas pipeline 


 project on its own. Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan 


 tried to push Saudi Arabia to proceed with CentGas (Delta of 


 Saudi Arabia was now the leader). But war and US-Taliban 


 tension made business impossible.



 For the remainder of the Clinton presidency, there would be 


 no official US or UN recognition of Afghanistan. And no 


 progress on the pipeline.



 Then George Walker Bush took the White House.
