Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

I just want to note with interest also in my good friend from New 
York's observations, on this side of the aisle we are in no way trying 
to criticize or humiliate the integrity of the great general that is 
now leading our forces in Iraq. In fact, I have the utmost respect for 
General Petraeus. He received his doctoral dissertation from Princeton 
University on counterinsurgency; and that is why, as the former 
commander of the 101st Airborne Division, he was so successful as a 
general up in Mosul. So I think we need to have that framework 
understood with my good friend from New York. We are not questioning 
the integrity of the good general, General Petraeus. It is the decision 
made by our President, who is the Commander in Chief, that we are 
debating about in this great debate that we are having this evening.

Madam Speaker, I want to yield 5/1/2/ minutes to my good friend, the 
gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a distinguished member of the 
Financial Services Committee.
