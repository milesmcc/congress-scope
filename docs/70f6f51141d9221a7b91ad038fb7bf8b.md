Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill to designate the 
facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4233 West 
Hillsboro Boulevard Coconut Creek, Florida, as the Army SPC Daniel 
Agami Post Office Building.



United States Army Specialist Daniel J. Agami was, in the words of 
his grandmother, ''the best of the best.'' He was much more than a 
soldier. He was a leader, a selfless patriot, and a joyous young man 
with a huge heart.

Born in Ohio, Daniel moved with his family to south Florida when he 
was 4. He attended the Hebrew Academy Community School and Coconut 
Creek High School and was in college when he decided he was meant for a 
higher purpose. Without consulting friends or family, Daniel answered 
his calling and enlisted in the Army.

Daniel brought the Army more than service and bravery. He brought his 
good humor, his tremendous heart and the moral conviction that he 
served something far greater than himself.

Affectionately known by his fellow soldiers as ''GI Jew,'' he strove 
constantly to improve the lives of those around him. When he was not 
educating his fellow soldiers about his religion, he was serving as a 
mentor to orphaned children in Iraq. In the words of his father, ''He 
had 10,000 friends, and 10,000 friends thinking he was their best 
friend.''

On June 21, 2007, Daniel Agami was killed while on patrol in Baghdad. 
He was only 25. More than 1,000 people attended his funeral. He was 
posthumously promoted to specialist, and his parents were presented 
with a number of medals, including the Bronze Star, Purple Heart and 
the Good Conduct Medal.

Daniel died defending his core belief that America fights for the 
freedom and survival of the entire world. As one friend recalled, ''He 
had said that if, God forbid, anything happened to him, this is where 
he belonged.''

A loving son, brother, grandson and friend, Daniel Agami will be 
missed, and not just by those 10,000 best friends, but by all Americans 
who cherish freedom and courage and honor.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that the life of this 
courageous young man and all that he stood for will not soon be 
forgotten.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
