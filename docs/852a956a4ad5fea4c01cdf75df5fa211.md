Mr. RODRIGUEZ. And I want to personally take this opportunity to 
thank you for your leadership as chairman of the VA Committee. And I 
can honestly tell you that I spent 8 years on the committee prior to 
leaving for 2 years and then coming back, and it has been day and night 
with your leadership there. And I want to personally thank you.

Nothing was more frustrating than to serve on the VA Committee for 8 
long years and not be able to make things happen. And, in fact, during 
that period of time is when we were charging our veterans even co-
payments and fees and those kind of things. But in the last 1 year and 
4 months we have been able, not only with the 2007 budget, the 2008 
budget, and the supplemental, we have been able to put $13 billion to 
our veterans. And so I want to personally thank you for your leadership 
on the part of the legislation that we have passed.

Just today in your committee, Mr. Chairman--and Chairwoman, thank you 
for this opportunity--we are able to pass a series of bills, one of 
them that seemed to simple, but picks up the COLA that addresses the 
needs of the survivor spouse as well as children, survivors of 
veterans, as well as disability compensation. So I want to thank you 
for that.

Let me just give you a couple of statistics. More than 700,000 
children have had parents deployed at some point during the conflict, 
700,000 children; 19,000 children have had their parents wounded in 
action; some 2,220 children have lost their parents both in Afghanistan 
and Iraq. Not to mention the fact that we have lost more soldiers, some 
6,000 per year, to suicides, which is uncalled for. And I am really 
glad that we have started to move on working on posttraumatic stress 
with our soldiers and adding some resources, and including legislation 
that allows an opportunity for the first time to reach out and work 
with the families of those individuals that suffer from posttraumatic 
stress disorders.

I know personally, just like those families know, that when somebody 
suffers from posttraumatic stress, just like when somebody suffers from 
alcoholism, the whole family gets impacted, the children, the spouses.

I just got a call a couple of weeks ago from a soldier that is 
getting deployed for the fourth time. And he was basically telling me, 
''Mr. Rodriguez, I have already lost my wife, we have gotten a divorce, 
and they are now taking away the opportunity for me to visit the 
children.''
