Mr. BERMAN. Reclaiming my time. I certainly don't know that that is 
true, and I would be stunned if it were. I would be stunned if our 
dedicated employees in a very difficult foreign mission or in the 
military were out promising things they couldn't deliver. I don't think 
our folks operate like that. I think they were processing applications 
in case and in the event that we increased the number of visas because 
the demand was so urgent. The gentleman from Oregon talked about 4 
million refugees. We are talking about an infinitesimal subset that 
worked for us in our campaign efforts in Iraq.
