`Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 2 October 2007`

---


Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. My friend from Arkansas, in the 
presentation earlier I had intended to discuss the 12 individuals that 
lived in counties that I represent before they lost their lives in 
Iraq. Four of those actually were not in my district, but there are 12 
individuals that either live in the county I represent or in the 
district I represent.

I made a commitment some time ago that each day that when I said my 
prayers for those in special prayer need, that these families would 
always be a part of my prayer list. And I keep a list of those in my 
wallet, of those individuals. I hope I don't have to add a new name. 
Occasionally I'll have to take this out and redo it and add a name to 
it. I hope I don't have to add another name until we're able to settle 
and resolve and bring our soldiers home from Iraq and from Afghanistan.

These individuals have honored us and our Nation, and I think that 
we, as Americans, need to be sure that we honor their name and their 
families, and that we keep them in our hearts and constantly in our 
minds so that we don't ever forget the commitment that they gave, and 
they gave all for this Nation.
