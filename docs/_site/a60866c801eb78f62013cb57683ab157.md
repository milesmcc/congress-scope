Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.

Today we mark an ominous anniversary. It was 5 years ago today that 
President Bush signed the congressional authorization to use military 
force in Iraq. As we have learned since, that authorization was based 
on fatally flawed information. Congress and the American people were 
told that we needed to go to war against Saddam Hussein because he had 
weapons of mass destruction. But there were no nuclear bombs or 
biological weapons.

Now, 5 years later, more than 3,800 U.S. servicemembers have been 
killed, more than 28,000 have been injured, and the U.S. taxpayers have 
spent more than $450 billion; and Iraq is in shambles.

Today we are considering a different resolution. The purpose of 
today's resolution is simple: to end the abuse of the classification 
process and to demand the truth about corruption in Iraq.

We must stop the pattern of dissembling and the misuse of classified 
information. President Bush is now asking taxpayers for an additional 
$150 billion to support the war and to support Iraqi Prime Minister 
Nouri al-Maliki. But . . . is not being honest about the level of 
corruption in the Maliki government.

Just as it did 5 years ago, the Bush administration is hiding the 
truth while seeking hundreds of billions of dollars and placing our 
troops in danger. We cannot allow this to happen.
