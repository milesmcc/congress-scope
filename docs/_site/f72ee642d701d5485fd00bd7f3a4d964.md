Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
support of the 13,500 teachers in California who will get to keep their 
jobs this fall as result of the education funding we provide today.

I rise in support of the over $1.8 billion that will come back to 
California to help pay for Medicaid assistance for low income people.

Without this crucial funding California would be forced into even 
more painful budget cuts that would have cascaded down to our local 
cities and counties--forcing layoffs for police, fire, EMT's and other 
critical personnel.

While I support this aid to the states to keep people at work--I am 
disappointed that the other body would choose to pay for this 
assistance on the backs of poor people who receive food stamps. I ask 
for unanimous consent to insert into the Record an August 6 editorial 
in the New York Times--Congress's Serial Hits on Food Stamps.

We spend trillions in support of two wars--funneling hundreds of 
billions of dollars into a black hole over at the Pentagon--yet we 
can't find another way to fund a good education for our kids or help 
States provide healthcare to the poor?

Have we lost our moral compass?

The Congress continues to throw away our children's inheritance in 
Afghanistan to pursue the longest war in American history, yet finds it 
okay to cut food stamps.

That doesn't make any sense! We should not have to choose between 
forcing people to go hungry and our children's education.

Madam Speaker, I will vote for this bill because the States are 
desperate for this money--but the other body should have done better.

In addition to these funds we should have been approving money to pay 
our debt to Black farmers and the Native American community, to fund 
youth employment programs, and to extend the TANF emergency contingency 
fund.

As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, I can say with certainty 
that we will not relent and will fight to get these priorities done. We 
should not have to choose between forcing people to go hungry and our 
children's education.

 Congress's Serial Hits on Food Stamps




 With some shabby sleight of hand, Congress has begun 


 tapping into the food stamp program for the hungriest 


 Americans to help pay for lawmakers' higher election-year 


 priorities. The Senate approved two important measures this 


 week--the $26 billion state-aid bill and the $4.5 billion 


 school nutrition program--in part by shaving food stamp funds 


 as a target of least resistance.



 There is no denying that both of the programs are badly 


 needed. The state aid package, regrettably compromised as it 


 was, helps protect jobs for teachers and other workers facing 


 layoffs. The school nutrition program provides the first 


 improvements in a generation, including an increase in meal 


 reimbursements and the power to set federal nutrition 


 standards for schools.





 But treating food stamps as the fungible means to worthy 


 ends is a cowardly blight on Congress. After the Bush years 


 of guilt-free tax cutting and deficit budgeting, lawmakers 


 are self-righteously embracing pay-as-you-go legislation lest 


 they be demagogued at the ballot box. So they resort to 


 fiscal triage.



 Originally, school nutrition was slated to be paid for by 


 cuts in a farm conservation program. But Republicans rated 


 this a high priority for the livestock industry. A deal was 


 struck with Democrats to cut back on the scheduled boost in 


 future food stamp benefits that was part of last year's 


 economic stimulus. Food stamps took a second hit as lawmakers 


 turned to it like an all-purpose A.T.M. to help cover the 


 cost of state aid.



 Senator Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat of Arkansas who fought 


 hard to get the school nutrition improvements, told 


 Politico.com that the food stamp increase was doomed in any 


 case: ''You saw the teachers grab for it.'' Her comfort was 


 those dollars would feed children. But this is a pale 


 rationalization that downgrades the hunger of entire 


 families. A companion bill in the House, yet to be paid for, 


 is an opportunity to right this wrong.



 In the crunch of the recession. if Congress lacks the guts 


 to meet vital needs with deficit financing, it should have 


 the decency to chisel some less-humane program than food 


 stamps.
