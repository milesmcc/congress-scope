Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I just would like to talk for a minute 
about the mission in the context of what is going on with the 
government in Kabul. The Washington Post did a story on February 25 
which talks about ''Officials puzzle over millions of dollars leaving 
Afghanistan by plane for Dubai,'' and I will include that for the 
Record.

Officials Puzzle Over Millions of Dollars Leaving Afghanistan by Plane 















 for Dubai














(By Andrew Higgins)




 Kabul.--A blizzard of bank notes is flying out of 


 Afghanistan--often in full view of customs officers at the 


 Kabul airport--as part of a cash exodus that is confounding 


 U.S. officials and raising concerns about the money's origin.



 The cash, estimated to total well over $1 billion a year, 


 flows mostly to the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai, where many 


 wealthy Afghans now park their families and funds, according 


 to U.S. and Afghan officials. So long as departing cash is 


 declared at the airport here, its transfer is legal.



 But at a time when the United States and its allies are 


 spending billions of dollars to prop up the fragile 


 government of President Hamid Karzai, the volume of the 


 outflow has stirred concerns that funds have been diverted 


 from aid. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, for its 


 part, is trying to figure out whether some of the money comes 


 from Afghanistan's thriving opium trade. And officials in 


 neighboring Pakistan think that at least some of the cash 


 leaving Kabul has been smuggled overland from Pakistan.



 ''All this money magically appears from nowhere,'' said a 


 U.S. official who monitors Afghanistan's growing role as a 


 hub for cash transfers to Dubai, which has six flights a day 


 to and from Kabul.



 Meanwhile, the United States is stepping up efforts to stop 


 money flow in the other direction--into Afghanistan and 


 Pakistan in support of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Senior 


 Treasury Department officials visited Kabul this month to 


 discuss the cash flows and other issues relating to this 


 country's infant, often chaotic financial sector.



 Tracking Afghan exchanges has long been made difficult by 


 the widespread use of traditional money-moving outfits, known 


 as ''hawalas,'' which keep few records. The Afghan central 


 bank, supported by U.S. Treasury advisers, is trying to get a 


 grip on them by licensing their operations.



 In the meantime, the money continues to flow. Cash 


 declaration forms filed at Kabul International Airport and 


 reviewed by The Washington Post show that Afghan passengers 


 took more than $180 million to Dubai during a two-month 


 period starting in July. If that rate held for the entire 


 year, the amount of cash that left Afghanistan in 2009 would 


 have far exceeded the country's annual tax and other domestic 


 revenue of about $875 million.



 The declaration forms highlight the prominent and often 


 opaque role played by hawalas. Asked to identify the ''source 


 of funds'' in forms issued by the Afghan central bank, cash 


 couriers frequently put down the name of the same Kabul 


 hawala, an outfit called New Ansari Exchange.



 Early last month, Afghan police and intelligence officers 


 raided New Ansari's office in Kabul's bazaar district, 


 carting away documents and computers, said Afghan bankers 


 familiar with the operation. U.S. officials declined to 


 comment on what prompted the raid. New Ansari Exchange, which 


 is affiliated with a licensed Afghan bank, closed for a day 


 or so but was soon up and running again.



 The total volume of departing cash is almost certainly much 


 higher than the declared amount. A Chinese man, for instance, 


 was arrested recently at the Kabul airport carrying 800,000 


 undeclared euros (about $1.1 million).



 Cash also can be moved easily through a VIP section at the 


 airport, from which Afghan officials generally leave without 


 being searched. American officials said that they have 


 repeatedly raised the issue of special treatment for VIPs at 


 the Kabul airport with the Afghan government but that they 


 have made no headway.



 One U.S. official said he had been told by a senior Dubai 


 police officer that an Afghan diplomat flew into the 


 emirate's airport last




 year with more than $2 million worth of euros in undeclared 


 cash. The Afghan consul general in Dubai, Haji Rashoudin 


 Mohammadi, said in a telephone interview that he was not 


 aware of any such incident.



 The high volume of cash passing through Kabul's airport 


 first came to light last summer when British company Global 


 Strategies Group, which has an airport security contract, 


 started filing reports on the money transfers at the request 


 of Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security, the 


 domestic intelligence agency. The country's notoriously 


 corrupt police force, however, complained about this 


 arrangement, and Global stopped its reporting in September, 


 according to someone familiar with the matter.



 Afghan bankers interviewed in Kabul said that much of the 


 money that does get declared belongs to traders who want to 


 buy goods in Dubai but want to avoid the fees, delays and 


 paperwork that result from conventional wire transfers.



 The cash flown out of Kabul includes a wide range of 


 foreign currencies. Most is in U.S. dollars, euros and--to 


 the bafflement of officials--Saudi Arabian riyals, a currency 


 not widely used in Afghanistan.



 Last month, a well-dressed Afghan man en route to Dubai was 


 found carrying three briefcases stuffed with $3 million in 


 U.S. currency and $2 million in Saudi currency, according to 


 an American official who was present when the notes were 


 counted. A few days later, the same man was back at the Kabul 


 airport, en route to Dubai again, with about $5 million in 


 U.S. and Saudi bank notes.



 One theory is that some of the Arab nation's cash might 


 come from Saudi donations that were supposed to go to mosques 


 and other projects in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But, the 


 American official said, ''we don't really know what is going 


 on.''



 Efforts to figure out just how much money is leaving 


 Afghanistan and why have been hampered by a lack of 


 cooperation from Dubai, complained Afghan and U.S. officials, 


 who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Dubai's financial 


 problems, said a U.S. official, had left the emirate eager 


 for foreign cash, and ''they don't seem to care where it 


 comes from.'' Dubai authorities declined to comment.


Previous to that, the Post did a story about money funneled through a 
Kabul bank and companies owned by the bank's founder to individual 
friends, family, and business connections of Hamid Karzai. When you 
consider the amount of corruption that is going on in Afghanistan, it 
can only be called, charitably, ''crony capitalism.'' In fact, The 
Washington Post printed an article on February 22, entitled ''In 
Afghanistan, Signs of Crony Capitalism,'' and I include this for the 
Record.

 In Afghanistan, Signs of Crony Capitalism














(By Andrew Higgins)




 Kabul.--Afghanistan's biggest private bank--founded by the 


 Islamic nation's only world-class poker player--celebrated 


 its fifth year in business last summer with a lottery for 


 depositors at Paris Palace, a Kabul wedding hall.



 Prizes awarded by Kabul Bank included nine apartments in 


 the Afghan capital and cash gifts totaling more than $1 


 million. The bank trumpeted the event as the biggest prize 


 drawing of its kind in Central Asia.



 Less publicly, Kabul Bank's boss has been handing out far 


 bigger prizes to his country's U.S.-backed ruling elite: 


 multimillion-dollar loans for the purchase of luxury villas 


 in Dubai by members of President Hamid Karzai's family, his 


 government and his supporters.



 The close ties between Kabul Bank and Karzai's circle 


 reflect a defining feature of the shaky post-Taliban order in 


 which Washington has invested more than $40 billion and the 


 lives of more than 900 U.S. service members: a crony 


 capitalism that enriches politically connected insiders and 


 dismays the Afghan populace.



 ''What I'm doing is not proper, not exactly what I should 


 do. But this is Afghanistan,'' Kabul Bank's founder and 


 chairman, Sherkhan Farnood, said in an interview when asked 


 about the Dubai purchases and why, according to data from the 


 Persian Gulf emirate's Land Department, many of the villas 


 have been registered in his name. ''These people don't want 


 to reveal their names.''



 Afghan laws prohibit hidden overseas lending and require 


 strict accounting of all transactions. But those involved in 


 the Dubai loans, including Kabul Bank's owners, said the cozy 


 flow of cash is not unusual or illegal in a deeply 


 traditional system underpinned more by relationships than 


 laws.



 The curious role played by the bank and its unorthodox 


 owners has not previously been reported and was documented by 


 land registration data; public records; and interviews in 


 Kabul, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Moscow.



 Many of those involved appear to have gone to considerable 


 lengths to conceal the benefits they have received from Kabul 


 Bank or its owners. Karzai's older brother and his former 


 vice president, for example, both have Dubai villas 


 registered under Farnood's name. Kabul Bank's executives said 


 their books record no loans for these or other Dubai deals 


 financed at least in part by Farnood, including home 


 purchases by Karzai's cousin and the brother of Mohammed 


 Qasim Fahim, his current first vice president and a much-


 feared warlord who worked closely with U.S. forces to topple 


 the Taliban in 2001.



 At a time when Washington is ramping up military pressure 


 on the Taliban, the off-balance-sheet activities of Afghan 


 bankers raise the risk of fmancial instability that could 


 offset progress on the battlefield. Fewer than 5 percent of 


 Afghans have bank accounts, but among those who do are many 


 soldiers and policemen whose salaries are paid through Kabul 


 Bank.



 A U.S. official who monitors Afghan finances, who spoke on 


 the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to 


 comment publicly, said banks appear to have plenty of money 


 but noted that in a crisis, Afghan depositors ''won't wait in 


 line holding cups of latte'' but would be ''waving AK-47s.''



 Kabul Bank executives, in separate interviews, gave 


 different accounts of what the bank is up to with Dubai home 


 buyers. ''They are borrowers. They have an account at Kabul 


 Bank,'' said the bank's chairman, Farnood, a boisterous 46-


 year-old with a gift for math and money--and the winner of 


 $120,000 at the 2008 World Series of Poker Europe, held in a 


 London casino.



 The bank's chief audit officer, Raja Gopalakrishnan, 


 however, insisted that the loan money didn't come directly 


 from Kabul Bank. He said it was from affiliated but separate 


 entities, notably a money-transfer agency called Shaheen 


 Exchange, which is owned by Farnood, is run by one of Kabul 


 Bank's 16 shareholders and operates in Kabul out of the 


 bank's headquarters.



 The audit officer said Farnood ''thinks it is one big 


 pot,'' but the entities are ''legally definitely separate.''
















 A new economy




 In some ways, Kabul Bank is a symbol of how much has 


 changed in Afghanistan since 2001, when the country had no 


 private banks and no economy to speak of. Kabul Bank has 


 opened more than 60 branches and recently announced that it 


 will open 250 more, and it claims to have more than $1 


 billion in deposits from more than a million Afghan 


 customers.



 Kabul Bank prospers because Afghanistan, though extremely 


 poor, is in places awash with cash, a result of huge 


 infusions of foreign aid, opium revenue and a legal economy 


 that, against the odds, is growing at about 15 percent a 


 year. The vast majority of this money flows into the hands of 


 a tiny minority--some of it through legitimate profits, some 


 of it through kickbacks and insider deals that bind the 


 country's political, security and business elites.



 The result is that, while anchoring a free-market order as 


 Washington had hoped, financial institutions here sometimes 


 serve as piggy banks for their owners and their political 


 friends. Kabul Bank, for example, helps bankroll a money-


 losing airline owned by Farnood and fellow bank shareholders 


 that flies three times a day between Kabul and Dubai.



 Kabul Bank's executives helped finance President Hamid 


 Karzai's fraud-blighted reelection campaign last year, and 


 the bank is partly owned by Mahmoud Karzai, the Afghan 


 president's older brother, and by Haseen Fahim, the brother 


 of Karzai's vice presidential running mate.



 Farnood, who now spends most of his time in Dubai, said he 


 wants to do business in a ''normal way'' and does not receive 


 favors as a result of his official contacts. He said that 


 putting properties in his name means his bank's money is safe 


 despite a slump in the Dubai property market: He can easily 


 repossess if borrowers run short on cash.



 A review of Dubai property data and interviews with current 


 and former executives of Kabul Bank indicate that Farnood and 


 his bank partners have at least $150 million invested in 


 Dubai real estate. Most of their property is on Palm 


 Jumeirah, a man-made island in the shape of a palm tree where 


 the cheapest house costs more than $2 million.



 Mirwais Azizi, an estranged business associate of Farnood 


 and the founder of the rival Azizi Bank in Kabul, has also 


 poured money into Dubai real estate, with even more uncertain 


 results. A Dubai company he heads, Azizi Investments, has 


 invested heavily in plots of land on Palm Jebel Ali, a 


 stalled property development. Azizi did not respond to 


 interview requests. His son, Farhad, said Mirwais was busy.



 Responsibility for bank supervision in Afghanistan lies 


 with the Afghan central bank, whose duties include preventing 


 foreign property speculation. The United States has spent 


 millions of dollars trying to shore up the central bank. But 


 Afghan and U.S. officials say the bank, though increasingly 


 professional, lacks political clout.



 The central bank's governor, Abdul Qadir Fitrat, said his 


 staff had ''vigorously investigated'' what he called 


 ''rumors'' of Dubai property deals, but ''unfortunately, up 


 until now they have not found anything.'' Fitrat, who used to 


 live in Washington, last month sent a team of inspectors to 


 Kabul Bank as part of a regular review of the bank's 


 accounts. He acknowledged that Afghan loans are ''very 


 difficult to verify'' because ''we don't know who owns 


 what.''



 Kabul Bank's dealings with Mahmoud Karzai, the president's 


 brother, help explain why this is so. In interviews, Karzai, 


 who has an Afghan restaurant in Baltimore, initially said he 


 rented a $5.5 million Palm Jumeirah mansion, where he now 


 lives with his family. But later he said he had an informal 


 home-loan agreement with Kabul Bank and pays $7,000 a month 


 in interest.





 ''It is a very peculiar situation. It is hard to comprehend 


 because this is not the usual way of doing business,'' said 


 Karzai, whose home is in Farnood's name.



 Karzai also said he bought a 7.4 percent stake in the bank 


 with $5 million he borrowed from the bank. But 


 Gopalakrishnan, the chief audit officer, said Kabul Bank's 


 books include no loans to the president's brother.



 Also in a Palm Jumeirah villa registered in Farnood's name 


 is the family of Ahmad Zia Massoud, Afghanistan's first vice 


 president from 2004 until last November. The house, bought in 


 December 2007 for $2.3 million, was first put in the name of 


 Massoud's wife but was later re-registered to give Farnood 


 formal ownership, property records indicate.



 Massoud, brother of the legendary anti-Soviet guerrilla 


 leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, said that Farnood had always been 


 the owner but let his family use it rent-free for the past 


 two years because he is ''my close friend.'' Massoud added: 


 ''We have played football together. We have played chess 


 together.'' Farnood, however, said that though the ''villa is 


 in my name,'' it belongs to Massoud ''in reality.''



 Haseen Fahim, the brother of Afghanistan's current first 


 vice president, has been another beneficiary of Kabul Bank's 


 largesse. He got money from Farnood to help buy a $6 million 


 villa in Dubai, which, unusually, is under his own name. He 


 borrowed millions more from the bank, which he partly owns, 


 to fund companies he owns in Afghanistan.



 In an interview at Kabul Bank's headquarters, Khalilullah 


 Fruzi, who as chief executive heads the bank's day-to-day 


 operations, said he didn't know how much bank money has ended 


 up in Dubai. If Karzai's relatives and others buy homes ''in 


 Dubai, or Germany or America . . . that is their own 


 affair,'' Fruzi said, adding that the bank ''doesn't give 


 loans directly for Dubai.''



 Fruzi, a former gem trader, said Kabul Bank is in robust 


 health, makes a profit and has about $400 million in liquid 


 assets deposited with the Afghan central bank and other 


 institutions. Kabul Bank is so flush, he added, that it is 


 building a $30 million headquarters, a cluster of shimmering 


 towers of bulletproof glass.



 The bank is also spending millions to hire gunmen from a 


 company called Khurasan Security Services, which, according 


 to registration documents, used to be controlled by Fruzi and 


 is now run by his brother.



 The roots of Kabul Bank stretch back to the Soviet Union. 


 Both Fruzi and Farnood got their education and their start in 


 business there after Moscow invaded Afghanistan in 1979.



 While in Moscow, Farnood set up a successful hawala money-


 transfer outfit to move funds between Russia and Kabul. 


 Russian court documents show that 10 of Farnood's employees 


 were arrested in 1998 and later convicted of illegal banking 


 activity. Fearful of arrest in Russia and also in Taliban-


 ruled Afghanistan, Farnood shifted his focus to Dubai.



 In 2004, three years after the fall of the Taliban regime, 


 he got a license to open Kabul Bank. His Dubai-registered 


 hawala, Shaheen Exchange, moved in upstairs and started 


 moving cash for bank clients. It last year shifted $250 


 million to $300 million to Dubai, said the chief audit 


 officer.



 The bank began to take in new, politically connected 


 shareholders, among them the president's brother, Mahmoud, 


 and Fahim, brother of the vice president, who registered his 


 stake in the name of his teenage son.



 Fahim said two of his companies have borrowed $70 million 


 from Kabul Bank. Insider borrowing, he said, is unavoidable 


 and even desirable in Afghanistan because, in the absence of 


 a solid legal system, business revolves around trust, not 


 formal contracts. ''Afghanistan is not America or Europe. 


 Afghanistan is starting from zero,'' he said.



 Fahim's business has boomed, thanks largely to 


 subcontracting work on foreign-funded projects, including a 


 new U.S. Embassy annex and various buildings at CIA sites 


 across the country, among them a remote base in Khost where 


 seven Americans were killed in a December suicide attack by a 


 Jordanian jihadiist. ''I have good opportunities to get 


 profit,'' Fahim said.















''Like wild horses''




 Kabul Bank also plunged into the airline business, 


 providing loans to Pamir Airways, an Afghan carrier now owned 


 by Farnood, Fruzi and Fahim. Pamir spent $46 million on four 


 used Boeing 737-400s and hired Hashim Karzai, the president's 


 cousin, formerly of Silver Spring, as a ''senior adviser.''



 Farnood said he also provided a ''little bit'' of money to 


 help Hashim Karzai buy a house on Palm Jumeirah in Dubai. 


 Karzai, in brief telephone interviews, said that the property 


 was an investment and that he had borrowed some money from 


 Farnood. He said he couldn't recall details and would ''have 


 to check with my accountant.''



 Noor Delawari, governor of the central bank during Kabul 


 Bank's rise, said Farnood and his lieutenants ''were like 


 wild horses'' and ''never paid attention to the rules and 


 regulations.'' Delawari said he didn't know about any 


 property deals by Kabul Bank in Dubai. He said that he, too, 


 bought a home in the emirate, for about $200,000.



 Fitrat, the current central bank governor, has tried to 


 take a tougher line against Kabul Bank and its rivals, with 


 little luck. Before last year's presidential election, the 


 central bank sent a stern letter to bankers, complaining that 


 they squander too much money on ''security guards and 


 bulletproof vehicles'' and ''expend large-scale monetary 


 assistance to politicians.'' The letter ordered them to 


 remain ''politically neutral.''



 Kabul Bank did the opposite: Fruzi, its chief executive, 


 joined Karzai's campaign in Kabul while Farnood, its poker-


 playing chairman, organized fundraising events for Karzai in 


 Dubai. One of these was held at the Palm Jumeirah house of 


 Karzai's brother.



 The government has returned the favor. The ministries of 


 defense, interior and education now pay many soldiers, police 


 and teachers through Kabul Bank. This means that tens of 


 millions of dollars' worth of public money sloshes through 


 the bank, an unusual arrangement, as governments generally 


 don't pump so much through a single private bank.



 Soon after his November inauguration for a second term, 


 President Karzai spoke at an anti-corruption conference in 


 Kabul, criticizing officials who ''after one or two years 


 work for the government get rich and buy houses in Dubai.'' 


 Last month, he flew to London for a conference on 


 Afghanistan, attended by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham 


 Clinton and other leaders, and again promised an end to the 


 murky deals that have so tarnished his rule.



 Also in London for the conference were Farnood, who now has 


 an Afghan diplomatic passport, and Fruzi, who served as a 


 financial adviser to Karzai's reelection campaign and also 


 owns a house in Dubai. ''If there is no Kabul Bank, there 


 will be no Karzai, no government,'' Fruzi said.


As a result, U.S. taxpayers and aid organizations are investing 
billions of dollars in Afghanistan, but the leaders of the country are 
investing in real estate in Dubai. We care about democracy. Try 
building democracy in a place which is rife with narcotraffic, crony 
capitalism, and villas in Dubai. What is this about? Why are we there? 
I mean, I am from Cleveland, Ohio. The people I represent are very 
basic people. When you tell them that the head of Afghanistan has his 
hands in all of these crooked deals, you start to wonder, We are going 
to build a democracy on this person's shoulders? I don't think so.

We are supporting a government where corruption is epidemic. Last 
year, USAID reported that corruption in Afghanistan is significant, a 
growing problem, and that pervasive, systemic corruption was at an 
unprecedented scope in the country's history. On November 17, 
Transparency International ranked Afghanistan as the second most 
corrupt nation in the world. And to compound the fears, in President 
Karzai's fraud-filled election late last year, he recently took over 
the country's election watchdog group. Is this the kind of person that 
we can trust to have a partnership with for democracy? I don't think 
so.

A January 2010 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
reveals that Afghan citizens were forced to pay an estimated $2.5 
billion a year in bribes. According to evidence collected through 
wiretaps and bank records, a senior border police official in Kandahar 
allegedly collected salaries of hundreds of ghost policemen and stole 
money from a government fund intended to pay orphans and widows. Is 
this the kind of environment where we can build a democracy?

Our troops in Afghanistan have to deal with corrupt officials on a 
daily basis. A commander of the Afghan border police offered to give 
the U.S. military prime land at a crossing with Pakistan to build a 
waiting area for supply vehicles needed for President Obama's troop 
increase. The same man, U.S. officials believe, earns tens of millions 
of dollars a year trafficking opium and extorting cargo truck drivers. 
Is this the kind of person that we can create movement toward a 
democracy with?

 How the U.S. Funds the Taliban















(By Aram Roston)




 On October 29, 2001, while the Taliban's rule over 


 Afghanistan was under assault, the regime's ambassador in 


 Islamabad gave a chaotic press conference in front of several 


 dozen reporters sitting on the grass. On the Taliban 


 diplomat's right sat his interpreter, Ahmad Rateb Popal, a 


 man with an imposing presence. Like the ambassador, Popal 


 wore a black turban, and he had a huge bushy beard. He had a 


 black patch over his right eye socket, a prosthetic left arm 


 and a deformed right hand, the result of injuries from an 


 explosives mishap during an old operation against the Soviets 


 in Kabul.



 But Popal was more than just a former mujahedeen. In 1988, 


 a year before the Soviets fled Afghanistan, Popal had been 


 charged in the United States with conspiring to import more 


 than a kilo of heroin. Court records show he was released 


 from prison in 1997.





 Flash forward to 2009, and Afghanistan is ruled by Popal's 


 cousin President Hamid Karzai. Popal has cut his huge beard 


 down to a neatly trimmed one and has become an immensely 


 wealthy businessman, along with his brother Rashid Popal, who 


 in a separate case pleaded guilty to a heroin charge in 1996 


 in Brooklyn. The Popal brothers control the huge Watan Group 


 in Afghanistan, a consortium engaged in telecommunications, 


 logistics and, most important, security. Watan Risk 


 Management, the Popals' private military arm, is one of the 


 few dozen private security companies in Afghanistan. One of 


 Watan's enterprises, key to the war effort, is protecting 


 convoys of Afghan trucks heading from Kabul to Kandahar, 


 carrying American supplies.



 Welcome to the wartime contracting bazaar in Afghanistan. 


 It is a virtual carnival of improbable characters and shady 


 connections, with former CIA officials and ex-military 


 officers joining hands with former Taliban and mujahedeen to 


 collect U.S. government funds in the name of the war effort.



 In this grotesque carnival, the U.S. military's contractors 


 are forced to pay suspected insurgents to protect American 


 supply routes. It is an accepted fact of the military 


 logistics operation in Afghanistan that the US government 


 funds the very forces American troops are fighting. And it is 


 a deadly irony, because these funds add up to a huge amount 


 of money for the Taliban. ''It's a big part of their 


 income,'' one of the top Afghan government security officials 


 told The Nation in an interview. In fact, US military 


 officials in Kabul estimate that a minimum of 10 percent of 


 the Pentagon's logistics contracts--hundreds of millions of 


 dollars--consists of payments to insurgents.



 Understanding how this situation came to pass requires 


 untangling two threads. The first is the insider dealing that 


 determines who wins and who loses in Afghan business, and the 


 second is the troubling mechanism by which ''private 


 security'' ensures that the US supply convoys traveling these 


 ancient trade routes aren't ambushed by insurgents.



 A good place to pick up the first thread is with a small 


 firm awarded a US military logistics contract worth hundreds 


 of millions of dollars: NCL Holdings. Like the Popals' Watan 


 Risk, NCL is a licensed security company in Afghanistan.



 What NCL Holdings is most notorious for in Kabul 


 contracting circles, though, is the identity of its chief 


 principal, Hamed Wardak. He is the young American son of 


 Afghanistan's current defense minister, Gen. Abdul Rahim 


 Wardak, who was a leader of the mujahedeen against the 


 Soviets. Hamed Wardak has plunged into business as well as 


 policy. He was raised and schooled in the United States, 


 graduating as valedictorian from Georgetown University in 


 1997. He earned a Rhodes scholarship and interned at the 


 neoconservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute. 


 That internship was to play an important role in his life, 


 for it was at AEI that he forged alliances with some of the 


 premier figures in American conservative foreign policy 


 circles, such as the late Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick.



 Wardak incorporated NCL in the United States early in 2007, 


 although the firm may have operated in Afghanistan before 


 then. It made sense to set up shop in Washington, because of 


 Wardak's connections there. On NCL's advisory board, for 


 example, is Milton Bearden, a well-known former CIA officer. 


 Bearden is an important voice on Afghanistan issues; in 


 October he was a witness before the Senate Foreign Relations 


 Committee, where Senator John Kerry, the chair, introduced 


 him as ''a legendary former CIA case officer and a 


 clearheaded thinker and writer.'' It is not every defense 


 contracting company that has such an influential adviser.



 But the biggest deal that NCL got--the contract that 


 brought it into Afghanistan's major leagues--was Host Nation 


 Trucking. Earlier this year the firm, with no apparent 


 trucking experience, was named one of the six companies that 


 would handle the bulk of US trucking in Afghanistan, bringing 


 supplies to the web of bases and remote outposts scattered 


 across the country.



 At first the contract was large but not gargantuan. And 


 then that suddenly changed, like an immense garden coming 


 into bloom. Over the summer, citing the coming ''surge'' and 


 a new doctrine, ''Money as a Weapons System,'' the U.S. 


 military expanded the contract 600 percent for NCL and the 


 five other companies. The contract documentation warns of 


 dire consequences if more is not spent: ''service members 


 will not get food, water, equipment, and ammunition they 


 require.'' Each of the military's six trucking contracts was 


 bumped up to $360 million, or a total of nearly $2.2 billion. 


 Put it in this perspective: this single two-year effort to 


 hire Afghan trucks and truckers was worth 10 percent of the 


 annual Afghan gross domestic product. NCL, the firm run by 


 the defense minister's well-connected son, had struck pure 


 contracting gold.



 Host Nation Trucking does indeed keep the US military 


 efforts alive in Afghanistan. ''We supply everything the army 


 needs to survive here,'' one American trucking executive told 


 me. ''We bring them their toilet paper, their water, their 


 fuel, their guns, their vehicles.'' The epicenter is Bagram 


 Air Base, just an hour north of Kabul, from which virtually 


 everything in Afghanistan is trucked to the outer reaches of 


 what the Army calls ''the Battlespace''--that is, the entire 


 country. Parked near Entry Control Point 3, the trucks line 


 up, shifting gears and sending up clouds of dust as they 


 prepare for their various missions across the country.



 The real secret to trucking in Afghanistan is ensuring 


 security on the perilous roads, controlled by warlords, 


 tribal militias, insurgents and Taliban commanders. The 


 American executive I talked to was fairly specific about it: 


 ''The Army is basically paying the Taliban not to shoot at 


 them. It is Department of Defense money.'' That is something 


 everyone seems to agree on.



 Mike Hanna is the project manager for a trucking company 


 called Afghan American Army Services. The company, which 


 still operates in Afghanistan, had been trucking for the 


 United States for years but lost out in the Host Nation 


 Trucking contract that NCL won. Hanna explained the security 


 realities quite simply: ''You are paying the people in the 


 local areas--some are warlords, some are politicians in the 


 police force--to move your trucks through.''



 Hanna explained that the prices charged are different, 


 depending on the route: ''We're basically being extorted. 


 Where you don't pay, you're going to get attacked. We just 


 have our field guys go down there, and they pay off who they 


 need to.'' Sometimes, he says, the extortion fee is high, and 


 sometimes it is low. ''Moving ten trucks, it is probably $800 


 per truck to move through an area. It's based on the number 


 of trucks and what you're carrying. If you have fuel trucks, 


 they are going to charge you more. If you have dry trucks, 


 they're not going to charge you as much. If you are carrying 


 MRAPs or Humvees, they are going to charge you more.''



 Hanna says it is just a necessary evil. ''If you tell me 


 not to pay these insurgents in this area, the chances of my 


 trucks getting attacked increase exponentially.''



 Whereas in Iraq the private security industry has been 


 dominated by US and global firms like Blackwater, operating 


 as de facto arms of the US government, in Afghanistan there 


 are lots of local players as well. As a result, the industry 


 in Kabul is far more dog-eat-dog. ''Every warlord has his 


 security company,'' is the way one executive explained it to 


 me.



 In theory, private security companies in Kabul are heavily 


 regulated, although the reality is different. Thirty-nine 


 companies had licenses until September, when another dozen 


 were granted licenses. Many licensed companies are 


 politically connected: just as NCL is owned by the son of the 


 defense minister and Watan Risk Management is run by 


 President Karzai's cousins, the Asia Security Group is 


 controlled by Hashmat Karzai, another relative of the 


 president. The company has blocked off an entire street in 


 the expensive Sherpur District. Another security firm is 


 controlled by the parliamentary speaker's son, sources say. 


 And so on.



 In the same way, the Afghan trucking industry, key to 


 logistics operations, is often tied to important figures and 


 tribal leaders. One major hauler in Afghanistan, Afghan 


 International Trucking (AIT), paid $20,000 a month in 


 kickbacks to a US Army contracting official, according to the 


 official's plea agreement in US court in August. AIT is a 


 very well-connected firm: it is run by the 25-year-old nephew 


 of Gen. Baba Jan, a former Northern Alliance commander and 


 later a Kabul police chief. In an interview, Baba Jan, a 


 cheerful and charismatic leader, insisted he had nothing to 


 do with his nephew's corporate enterprise.



 But the heart of the matter is that insurgents are getting 


 paid for safe passage because there are few other ways to 


 bring goods to the combat outposts and forward operating 


 bases where soldiers need them. By definition, many outposts 


 are situated in hostile terrain, in the southern parts of 


 Afghanistan. The security firms don't really protect convoys 


 of American military goods here, because they simply can't; 


 they need the Taliban's cooperation.



 One of the big problems for the companies that ship 


 American military supplies across the country is that they 


 are banned from arming themselves with any weapon heavier 


 than a rifle. That makes them ineffective for battling 


 Taliban attacks on a convoy. ''They are shooting the drivers 


 from 3,000 feet away with PKMs,'' a trucking company 


 executive in Kabul told me. ''They are using RPGs [rocket-


 propelled grenades] that will blow up an up-armed vehicle. So 


 the security companies are tied up. Because of the rules, 


 security companies can only carry AK-47s, and that's just a 


 joke. I carry an AK--and that's just to shoot myself if I 


 have to!''



 The rules are there for a good reason: to guard against 


 devastating collateral damage by private security forces. 


 Still, as Hanna of Afghan American Army Services points out, 


 ''An AK-47 versus a rocket-propelled grenade--you are going 


 to lose!'' That said, at least one of the Host Nation 


 Trucking companies has tried to do battle instead of paying 


 off insurgents and warlords. It is a US-owned firm called 


 Four Horsemen International. Instead of providing payments, 


 it has tried to fight off attackers. And it has paid the 


 price in lives, with horrendous casualties. FHI, like many 


 other firms, refused to talk publicly; but I've been told by 


 insiders in the security industry that FHI's convoys are 


 attacked on virtually every mission.



 For the most part, the security firms do as they must to 


 survive. A veteran American manager in Afghanistan who has 


 worked there as both a soldier and a private security 


 contractor in the field told me, ''What we are doing is 


 paying warlords associated with the Taliban, because none of 


 our security elements is able to deal with the threat.'' He's




 an Army veteran with years of Special Forces experience, and 


 he's not happy about what's being done. He says that at a 


 minimum American military forces should try to learn more 


 about who is getting paid off.



 ''Most escorting is done by the Taliban,'' an Afghan 


 private security official told me. He's a Pashto and former 


 mujahedeen commander who has his finger on the pulse of the 


 military situation and the security industry. And he works 


 with one of the trucking companies carrying US supplies. 


 ''Now the government is so weak,'' he added, ''everyone is 


 paying the Taliban.''



 To Afghan trucking officials, this is barely even something 


 to worry about. One woman I met was an extraordinary 


 entrepreneur who had built up a trucking business in this 


 male-dominated field. She told me the security company she 


 had hired dealt directly with Taliban leaders in the south. 


 Paying the Taliban leaders meant they would send along an 


 escort to ensure that no other insurgents would attack. In 


 fact, she said, they just needed two armed Taliban vehicles. 


 ''Two Taliban is enough,'' she told me. ''One in the front 


 and one in the back.'' She shrugged. ''You cannot work 


 otherwise. Otherwise it is not possible.''



 Which leads us back to the case of Watan Risk, the firm run 


 by Ahmad Rateb Popal and Rashid Popal, the Karzai family 


 relatives and former drug dealers. Watan is known to control 


 one key stretch of road that all the truckers use: the 


 strategic route to Kandahar called Highway 1. Think of it as 


 the road to the war--to the south and to the west. If the 


 Army wants to get supplies down to Helmand, for example, the 


 trucks must make their way through Kandahar.



 Watan Risk, according to seven different security and 


 trucking company officials, is the sole provider of security 


 along this route. The reason is simple: Watan is allied with 


 the local warlord who controls the road. Watan's company 


 website is quite impressive, and claims its personnel ''are 


 diligently screened to weed out all ex-militia members, 


 supporters of the Taliban, or individuals with loyalty to 


 warlords, drug barons, or any other group opposed to 


 international support of the democratic process.'' Whatever 


 screening methods it uses, Watan's secret weapon to protect 


 American supplies heading through Kandahar is a man named 


 Commander Ruhullah. Said to be a handsome man in his 40s, 


 Ruhullah has an oddly high-pitched voice. He wears 


 traditional salwar kameez and a Rolex watch. He rarely, if 


 ever, associates with Westerners. He commands a large group 


 of irregular fighters with no known government affiliation, 


 and his name, security officials tell me, inspires obedience 


 or fear in villages along the road.



 It is a dangerous business, of course: until last spring 


 Ruhullah had competition--a one-legged warlord named 


 Commander Abdul Khaliq. He was killed in an ambush.



 So Ruhullah is the surviving road warrior for that stretch 


 of highway. According to witnesses, he works like this: he 


 waits until there are hundreds of trucks ready to convoy 


 south down the highway. Then he gets his men together, 


 setting them up in 4x4s and pickups. Witnesses say he does 


 not limit his arsenal to AK-47s but uses any weapons he can 


 get. His chief weapon is his reputation. And for that, Watan 


 is paid royally, collecting a fee for each truck that passes 


 through his corridor. The American trucking official told me 


 that Ruhullah ''charges $1,500 per truck to go to Kandahar. 


 Just 300 kilometers.''



 It's hard to pinpoint what this is, exactly--security, 


 extortion or a form of ''insurance.'' Then there is the 


 question, Does Ruhullah have ties to the Taliban? That's 


 impossible to know. As an American private security veteran 


 familiar with the route said, ''He works both sides . . . 


 whatever is most profitable. He's the main commander. He's 


 got to be involved with the Taliban. How much, no one 


 knows.''



 Even NCL, the company owned by Hamed Wardak, pays. Two 


 sources with direct knowledge tell me that NCL sends its 


 portion of US logistics goods in Watan's and Ruhullah's 


 convoys. Sources say NCL is billed $500,000 per month for 


 Watan's services. To underline the point: NCL, operating on a 


 $360 million contract from the US military, and owned by the 


 Afghan defense minister's son, is paying millions per year 


 from those funds to a company owned by President Karzai's 


 cousins, for protection.



 Hamed Wardak wouldn't return my phone calls. Milt Bearden, 


 the former CIA officer affiliated with the company, wouldn't 


 speak with me either. There's nothing wrong with Bearden 


 engaging in business in Afghanistan, but disclosure of his 


 business interests might have been expected when testifying 


 on US policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. After all, NCL 


 stands to make or lose hundreds of millions based on the 


 whims of US policy-makers.



 It is certainly worth asking why NCL, a company with no 


 known trucking experience, and little security experience to 


 speak of, would win a contract worth $360 million. Plenty of 


 Afghan insiders are asking questions. ''Why would the US 


 government give him a contract if he is the son of the 


 minister of defense?'' That's what Mahmoud Karzai asked me. 


 He is the brother of President Karzai, and he himself has 


 been treated in the press as a poster boy for access to 


 government officials. The New York Times even profiled him in 


 a highly critical piece. In his defense, Karzai emphasized 


 that he, at least, has refrained from US government or Afghan 


 government contracting. He pointed out, as others have, that 


 Hamed Wardak had little security or trucking background 


 before his company received security and trucking contracts 


 from the Defense Department. ''That's a questionable business 


 practice,'' he said. ''They shouldn't give it to him. How 


 come that's not questioned?''



 I did get the opportunity to ask General Wardak, Hamed's 


 father, about it. He is quite dapper, although he is no 


 longer the debonair ''Gucci commander'' Bearden once 


 described. I asked Wardak about his son and NCL. ''I've tried 


 to be straightforward and correct and fight corruption all my 


 life,'' the defense minister said. ''This has been something 


 people have tried to use against me, so it has been 


 painful.''



 Wardak would speak only briefly about NCL. The issue seems 


 to have produced a rift with his son. ''I was against it from 


 the beginning, and that's why we have not talked for a long 


 time. I have never tried to support him or to use my power or 


 influence that he should benefit.''



 When I told Wardak that his son's company had a US contract 


 worth as much as $360 million, he did a double take. ''This 


 is impossible,'' he said. ''I do not believe this.''



 I believed the general when he said he really didn't know 


 what his son was up to. But cleaning up what look like 


 insider deals may be easier than the next step: shutting down 


 the money pipeline going from DoD contracts to potential 


 insurgents.



 Two years ago, a top Afghan security official told me, 


 Afghanistan's intelligence service, the National Directorate 


 of Security, had alerted the American military to the 


 problem. The NDS delivered what I'm told are ''very 


 detailed'' reports to the Americans explaining how the 


 Taliban are profiting from protecting convoys of US supplies.



 The Afghan intelligence service even offered a solution: 


 what if the United States were to take the tens of millions 


 paid to security contractors and instead set up a dedicated 


 and professional convoy support unit to guard its logistics 


 lines? The suggestion went nowhere.



 The bizarre fact is that the practice of buying the 


 Taliban's protection is not a secret. I asked Col. David 


 Haight, who commands the Third Brigade of the Tenth Mountain 


 Division, about it. After all, part of Highway 1 runs through 


 his area of operations. What did he think about security 


 companies paying off insurgents? ''The American soldier in me 


 is repulsed by it,'' he said in an interview in his office at 


 FOB Shank in Logar Province. ''But I know that it is what it 


 is: essentially paying the enemy, saying, 'Hey, don't hassle 


 me.' I don't like it, but it is what it is.''



 As a military official in Kabul explained contracting in 


 Afghanistan overall, ''We understand that across the board 10 


 percent to 20 percent goes to the insurgents. My intel guy 


 would say it is closer to 10 percent. Generally it is 


 happening in logistics.''



 In a statement to The Nation about Host Nation Trucking, 


 Col. Wayne Shanks, the chief public affairs officer for the 


 international forces in Afghanistan, said that military 


 officials are ''aware of allegations that procurement funds 


 may find their way into the hands of insurgent groups, but we 


 do not directly support or condone this activity, if it is 


 occurring.'' He added that, despite oversight, ''the 


 relationships between contractors and their subcontractors, 


 as well as between subcontractors and others in their 


 operational communities, are not entirely transparent.''



 In any case, the main issue is not that the US military is 


 turning a blind eye to the problem. Many officials 


 acknowledge what is going on while also expressing a deep 


 disquiet about the situation. The trouble is that--as with so 


 much in Afghanistan--the United States doesn't seem to know 


 how to fix it.


I reserve the balance of my time.
