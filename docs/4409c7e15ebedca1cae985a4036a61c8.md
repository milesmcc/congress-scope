`Mr. ENZI â€” 27 March 2007`

---

 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to state my position on 
the Cochran amendment No. 643 voted on by the U.S. Senate.

I was unable to vote due to a family emergency but would have voted 
in favor of the Cochran amendment. I was pleased to be an original 
cosponsor of the amendment.

I do not support congressional micromanagement of military operations 
and I do not support the congressionally mandated phased deployment of 
our troops in Iraq.

Troop redeployment decisions should be made by military leaders and 
the combat commanders who are on the ground in Iraq. I do not favor a 
set redeployment date, reporting to our enemies in language ''cut in 
stone.''

Congress must provide our troops with the resources they need when 
they need it. I fully support our Armed Forces personnel in their 
current military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I want our troops to come home as soon as possible. My goal has 
always been for American Armed Forces to stand down as the Iraqi forces 
stand up. The United States cannot abandon the efforts of the people 
who have sacrificed so much.
