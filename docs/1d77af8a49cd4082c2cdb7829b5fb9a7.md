Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, this week we received more proof 
from Iraq that the President's troop escalation plan is failing.

A senior U.S. military commander told the Washington Post yesterday 
that if the President really wanted to stem the violence in Iraq, he 
would have to send an additional 20,000 U.S. troops there, something 
that no American would support. But even then, it appears that Iraq 
will remain incapable of taking full responsibility. Iraq is in a civil 
war, and our troops, it is not the job of our men and women in uniform 
to be refereeing a civil war.

Last week, one of our generals put a surveillance out to determine 
who was laying these IEDs that are killing our troops, and it turned 
out to be Iraqi security forces, people who work with us by day and 
then were trying to kill our soldiers by night.

It is time for Democrats and Republicans to work together to bring 
the President to his senses, to change the direction of the war in 
Iraq.
