`Mr. STEVENS â€” 22 April 2008`

---


Mr. STEVENS. He said this:




 The transatlantic alliance is, of course, a product of 


 historical connection, culture, language and tradition. But 


 most of all it is an alliance of belief, of shared values, of 


 a common outlook not just about nations and their common 


 interest but about humanity and its common destiny. Out of 


 the travails of the twentieth century, the alliance drew its 


 history and its strength. In the fight against fascism, and 


 communism, it confronted and defeated totalitarian ideology. 


 Millions of our citizens died for the victory. Through their 


 sacrifice, we gained our freedom.



 More than that, we came to a profound understanding about 


 what it is to be free. We realized through the pain and 


 suffering, the difference between deferring to those in power 


 and deciding who they are; between the rule of law and the 


 caprice of dictatorship; between the right to speak out and 


 the silence of the fearful.



 Now with those twentieth century battles over, it is 


 tempting to think that this alliance has served its purpose. 


 But here is the important point about it. It was never, and 


 is not now, an alliance only of interests. It was and is an 


 alliance of conviction. We, in the West, don't own the idea 


 of freedom. We didn't fight for it because of the 


 happenstance of birth in Europe or America. It is there, in 


 the DNA of humankind. It is universal in nature and appeal. 


 We developed it, but we didn't invent it.



 Now is the time to stand up for it. If we want our values 


 to govern the twenty-first century, we must combine hard and 


 soft power. We must show unhesitating resolution in the face 


 of threats to our security; and we must show that our values 


 are indeed universal, that they encompass not only freedom 


 but justice, and not for us alone but for the world as a 


 whole. We must show these values are global. And build 


 alliances accordingly, starting with the renewal of our own. 


 And we need to do it with energy and urgency. In the Middle 


 East this is time critical. We must act now.



 Two things I now perceive more clearly than in office. The 


 first is: the fundamental shift of the centre of gravity, 


 politically and economically, to the East, to China and of 


 course India, but more broadly to the Middle and Far Eastern 


 nations.



 This evening I will focus elsewhere, but suffice it to say 


 that we are still, in the West, not in the state of 


 comprehension or analysis we need to be, fully to grasp this 


 shift. China and India together will over the coming decades 


 industrialize on a scale, and at a pace, the world has never 


 seen before. In China especially, the implications are huge. 


 Whatever the present controversies, a strong strategic 


 relationship with it is vital; as it is with India. We are so 


 much better able to fashion the terms of such a relationship 


 if we do it in unison. That alone would justify and re-


 justify our alliance.



 This is a challenge of diplomacy and statesmanship of one 


 kind.



 The other challenge arises from the security threat that 


 occupied so much of the last years of my premiership. Today, 


 as we meet, our armed forces face the prospect of a 


 continuing campaign in Afghanistan and Iraq. I hope one thing 


 unites us all. Whatever the debate about the decisions that 


 brought us to these countries, there should be no debate 


 about the magnificent and sustained heroism of our armed 


 forces. British and American troops and the forces of 


 other allied nations deserve our full support and our 


 gratitude.



 But this struggle is not limited to those fields of 


 conflict. Out in the Middle East, it is there in the 


 activities of Hezbollah in Lebanon, of Hamas in Palestine; it 


 is played out in the street of Arab opinion every day. It has 


 spread across the world. More than a score of nations have 


 suffered terror attacks in the last year, still more have 


 foiled them. They do not include only the usual list, but 


 Thailand, Nigeria, China itself.



 In the Middle East, the ideology that drives the extremism 


 is not abating. The Annual Arab Public Opinion survey 


 published last week was not striking simply for its specific 


 findings but for its overall picture. The basic ideological 


 thrust of the extremists has an impact way beyond the small 


 number of those prepared to engage in terror. In sum, it 


 shows an alarming number of people who buy the view that 


 Islam is under attack from the West; the leaders to support 


 are those like Nasrallah and Ahmadinejad who are perceived to 


 take on the West; and there is a contrast between Governments 


 and their people that is stark.



 The extremism is a tiny minority activity; the ideas, 


 prejudices and sentiments that drive it, are not. The truth 


 is that the roots of this global ideology are deep, far 


 deeper than I first thought in the aftermath of September 11.



 I believe the eventual outcome is not in doubt. But it is 


 possible, dangerously, to underestimate the size of this 


 challenge. And it is possible completely to misunderstand its 


 origins.



 This global ideology is based on a total perversion of the 


 true faith of Islam. Its revolutionary rhetoric and 


 attachment to so-called liberation movements is a sham 


 designed to hide its profoundly reactionary and regressive 


 character. It is totalitarian in nature and compromising with 


 it will lead not to peace but to a ratcheting up of demands, 


 none of which are remotely tolerable.



 But it plays cleverly on the insecurities and uncertainty 


 deep within Islam. It speaks to a sense that the reason for 


 its problems is not to be found within, but as victims of 


 outside aggression.



 So today the issue hangs in the balance. The Middle East is 


 without doubt a region in transition; but in which direction 


 will it travel?



 Like it or not, we are part of the struggle. Drawn into it, 


 Europe and America must hold together and hold firm. Not 


 simply for our own sake, but for that of our allies within 


 Islam. If we do not show heart, why should they?



 If they don't see our resolve, how much more fragile is 


 theirs?



 So how is this battle won?



 We have to recognize that though the circumstances and 


 conflicts of the twentieth century are very different from 


 ours, nonetheless, one thing remains true in any time and for 


 all time: That if under attack, there is no choice but to 


 defend, with a vigour, determination and will, superior to 


 those attacking us. Our opponents today think we lack this 


 will. Indeed they are counting on it. They think that if they 


 make the struggle long enough and savage enough, we will 


 eventually lose heart, and our will fade. They are fanatics 


 but they have, unfortunately, the dedication that accompanies 


 fanaticism.



 We cannot permit this to happen. Where we are confronted, 


 we confront. We stand up. And we do so for as long as it 


 takes. This ideology now has a nation, Iran, that seeks to 


 put itself at the head of extreme Islam. They need to know 


 what we say, we mean and, if necessary, will do. If we 


 exhibit this attitude, peace is more likely; because they 


 will not miscalculate or misread our character. But if they 


 think us weak, they will fight all the harder and risk all 


 the more.



 They need to see our belief. We should not apologize for 


 our values, but wear them with pride, proclaim their virtues 


 loudly; show confidence; ridicule the notion that when people 


 choose freedom this is somehow provocation to terror; and do 


 so together, one alliance.



 This struggle did not begin on September 11th 2001. It 


 isn't the fault of President Bush, of Israel, or of Western 


 policy. The idea that we suppress Muslims in the West is 


 utterly absurd. There is more religious freedom for Islam in 


 London than in many Muslim countries.


Madam President, I found his statement very convincing. I urge 
Senators to read it.

 loudly; show confidence; ridicule the notion that when people 


 choose freedom this is somehow provocation to terror; and do 


 so together, one alliance.



 This struggle did not begin on September 11th, 2001. It 


 isn't the fault of George Bush, of Israel, or of Western 


 policy. The idea that we suppress Muslims in the West is 


 utterly absurd. There is more religious freedom for Islam in 


 London than in many Muslim countries.



 You can argue about the rights and wrongs of the military 


 invasion of Iraq or Afghanistan, but to allow for a single 


 instant that this action justifies not simply terrorism but 


 the idea that the West is innately hostile to Islam, only has 


 to be contemplated, rationally, momentarily, for its nonsense 


 to be manifest. We get rid of two brutal dictatorships; put 


 in place a U.N. led democratic process; plus billions of 


 dollars in aid: Where exactly is the hostility to Islam? And 


 the only reason our troops are forced to stay is because of 


 terror attacks carried out by this ideology in defiance of 


 the democratically expressed wishes of the Muslim people of 


 both countries.



 And if it is hard and bloody, how bizarre to blame the 


 allied forces, there under a U.N. mandate and who are trying 


 to keep the peace, rather than those using terror to disturb 


 it.



 Yet this paradigm that it is 'our' fault that this terror 


 threat is with us, has infiltrated a large part of Middle 


 Eastern public opinion and actually influences significantly 


 a large part of our own. It has to be taken on.



 And here is the good news. The same poll shows most Muslims 


 want peace. Most support a two-state solution in Israel and 


 Palestine. The modern minded rulers of the successful Arab 


 economies are also admired. People in Iran don't hate America 


 even if its leader does. Go beneath the surface and there are 


 allies out in the region and within Islam; people who believe 


 strongly in their faith, but know that the twenty-first 


 century is not about civilisations in combat but in alliance. 


 In other words people are open to persuasion.



 And here is the point. To win this struggle, we must be 


 prepared to confront; but we must also be prepared to 


 persuade.



 This is a battle that can take a military or security form. 


 But it can't be won by military or security means alone. It 


 is a baffle of ideas. To win, we must persuade people of what 


 we stand for and why; and we must do so in a way that answers 


 their concerns as well as our own.



 We believe in freedom and democracy. We also believe in 


 justice. We believe in equality. We believe in a fair chance 


 for all, in opportunity that goes beyond an elite and 


 stretches down into the core of society. That, after all, is 


 the American dream; free not just in politics but free to 


 achieve, to fulfil your ambition by your own efforts and hard 


 work, to make something of yourself, to give your children a 


 better start than you had.



 To win this battle, we must demonstrate these values too. 


 That is why the Middle East peace process matters. It is the 


 litmus test of our sincerity. We should not in any way dilute 


 our commitment to Israel's security. We simply have to show 


 equal commitment to justice for the Palestinians.



 In the coming months, we have a chance to put it on a path 


 to peace. It will require Israel to do more to lift the 


 burden of occupation and give the Palestinians a sense that a 


 state is possible. It will require the Palestinians to do 


 more to get the robust capability on security to give the 


 Israelis a sense that a state is possible. It will require a 


 different and better strategy for Gaza. And it will require a 


 relentless, insistent focus on the issues, from the U.S. and 


 the international community, macro- and micro-managing it as 


 necessary, to get the job done. President Bush and Secretary 


 Rice have made that commitment. This can be done. It has to 


 be done. It is not optional. It is mandatory for success.



 The origin of this extremism does not lie in this dispute; 


 but a major part of defeating it, lies in its resolution.



 Then, wider than this, we have to work with the modern and 


 moderate voices within Islam to help them counter the 


 extremism and show how faith in Islam is supremely consistent 


 with engagement in the twenty first century, economically, 


 politically, and culturally. There is a vast amount of toil 


 and time and energy to be expended in building bridges, 


 educating each other about the other, creating the civic 


 and social networks of reconciliation.



 I would go further still.



 In Africa, we have a cause of justice which cries out to be 


 pursued; one that is, at the same time, a moral imperative 


 and a strategic investment; one that needs the attention of 


 East and West. In climate change, we have an issue that 


 demonstrates that justice is also part of the compact of 


 responsibility between this generation and those of the 


 future.



 My argument is therefore this. The struggle can be won. But 


 it can only be won by a strategy big enough and comprehensive 


 enough to remove the roots as well as the branches. The 


 battle will, in the end, be won within Islam. But only if we 


 show that our values are theirs also.





 The problem with so much of Western politics is that the 


 argument is posed as one between the advocates of hard power 


 and soft power, when the reality is, we need both.



 This is where America and Europe, united, should act. 


 America has to reach out. Europe has to stand up. Not a 


 single one of the global challenges facing us today is more 


 easily capable of solution, if we are apart; if we let the 


 small irritants obscure the fundamental verities; if we allow 


 ourselves to be assailed by doubt about the value of our 


 partnership, rather than affirm, albeit self-critically, its 


 strengths.



 We need now a powerful revival of our alliance. In the 


 world so rapidly changing around us, we cannot take a narrow 


 view of our interests or a short-sighted view of our destiny. 


 We can't afford to take fright at these changes and go back 


 into isolationism. We can't avoid the challenges. But we can 


 master them. Together.



 The transatlantic partnership was never just the foundation 


 of our security. It was the foundation of our way of life. It 


 was forged in experience of the most bitter and anguished 


 kind.



 Out of it came a new Europe, a new world order, a new 


 consensus as to how life should be lived.



 Today times are different. Every era is different. What is 


 necessary is to distinguish between what endures for one time 


 and what endures for all time.



 In our history, we discovered the values that endure. We 


 learnt what really matters and what is worth fighting for.



 And we learnt it together.



 Today, the challenge to those values is different. But it 


 is no less real. Our propensity to avow those values will 


 shape the way the twenty first century is governed. Will 


 these values become, as they should be, universal values, 


 open over time to all human beings everywhere; or will they 


 be falsely seen as the product of a bygone age? That is the 


 question. It is fundamental. It is urgent. It is our duty to 


 answer it.
