Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to address the impasse--the 
completely avoidable impasse--that we face with regard to the Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations bill, which, if I'm not mistaken, is 
intended to provide much-needed funds and resources for our troops 
serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. You'll have to pardon my confusion 
because, looking over the substance of the bill in front of us, it is 
difficult to determine exactly what purpose it is meant to serve.

There has been in this and in virtually every recent election year a 
sensitivity among those on the other side of the aisle whenever anyone 
questions their support for our Nation's military and their commitment 
to national security. Indeed, it seems that any time these issues are 
mentioned, whether it is by the President, those of us in Congress, or 
by candidates running for office, Republicans are accused of 
''questioning their patriotism'' or engaging in the ''politics of 
fear.''

Certainly, I don't believe that we should question the patriotism of 
those in the Senate majority. I believe that every one of them loves 
their country and that there is no one in this chamber who does not 
honor and respect our nation's military. However, while the majority's 
patriotism should not be subject to question, their judgment on these 
issues is fair game.

Frankly, after the recent FISA debacle and now the absurd course 
being taken on this emergency supplemental, I believe that the 
Democrats in Congress have given all of us reason to question their 
judgment.

As I stated, the purpose of this bill is to provide much-needed 
funding for our troops in harms way. However, it appears that the 
Democrats see this--not as an opportunity to support our military, but 
as a vehicle for unrelated, nonemergency funding for a number of their 
pet programs. In this time when the American people are clamoring for 
more fiscal discipline in Congress, the majority has decided to tack 
onto a war supplemental billions of dollars in domestic spending, none 
of which was requested by the President and all of which is unrelated 
to supporting the troops.

For example, the bill includes $1.2 billion for a science initiative, 
$1 billion for government-funded energy assistance, nearly half a 
billion each for transportation projects and wildfires, and $200 
million for the U.S. census--an event that has taken place every 10 
years since 1790. They have also added more than $60 billion in 
mandatory spending relating to unemployment insurance extensions--in a 
time of very low unemployment, no less--and veterans education 
benefits.

Now, I am sure that many of these are worthwhile endeavors deserving 
of the Senate's time and attention. However, they can and should all be 
debated separately and should not be tied to funding for the troops.

Given these efforts to add such a large number of unrelated and 
nonemergency provisions, is it really unreasonable for the American 
people to conclude that supporting the troops is not the majority's 
highest priority?

Certainly, they'll want all of us to believe otherwise. In fact, I am 
fairly sure that there is a Democrat somewhere watching me give this 
speech preparing a response that accuses me of practicing the 
''politics of fear.''

But when Members of the Senate majority flatly refuse to provide 
resources for the troops without unrelated spending, what other 
conclusion is there for the rest of us to draw?

It gets worse. I wish that the added funding was the worst thing 
about this bill. Unfortunately, it is the least of our worries.

In addition to the nonemergency spending, the Democrats have once 
again attempted to use a bill that funds our troops as an opportunity 
to play armchair quarterback with the conduct of the war.

The majority knows that the inclusion of this provision guarantees 
that the President will veto the bill. One also has to assume that they 
know that they do not have the votes to override such a veto. Yet, once 
again, we are about to send to the President a bill that conditions our 
support for the troops on his agreement to supplant the judgment of his 
military commanders with the political whims of the Senate majority.



This comes at a time when even the most strident opponents of the war 
have begun to acknowledge our military's successes on the ground in 
Iraq. Even worse, it comes at a time when our men and women in uniform 
are in desperate need of additional funding.

As we have heard, on May 5, Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated that it was essential that funds be 
approved before the Memorial Day recess, which begins in less than 2 
days. In his words, the military will ''stop paying soldiers on June 15 
'' meaning that they have ''precious little flexibility'' with respect 
to the funds.

The majority leader, in his own words, believes that not finishing 
the bill before the recess is ''no big deal.'' Indeed, he admits that 
sending the bill in its current form to the President guarantees that 
we will go to recess without having funded the troops. Instead of 
heeding the warnings of our military leaders, the majority would 
apparently rather subject emergency military funds to yet another 
partisan debate and even more election-year political wrangling.

I understand that many in the majority have come to oppose this war. 
I, for one, do not oppose an honest, straightforward debate about our 
policies in Iraq and the war on terror. However, that is simply not 
what is going on here today. This is not a serious debate about our 
future in Iraq; it is a needless political maneuver aimed at appeasing 
the more radical elements of the Democrats' political base.

Once again, I can't help but wonder about the majority party's 
priorities when its members purposefully and dangerously delay funding 
for our troops in order to make a political statement. As I stated, I 
will not question their patriotism, but I will continue to question 
their judgment. Given what has been displayed here, I believe the 
American people will as well.
