Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Just to think about the lack of planning and 
details for the whole deal, as these Iraqi troops are supposed to stand 
up, we are supposed to stand down. That is why in our supplemental we 
said let's work something out. There was no exact formula, but as one 
brigade of Iraqi troops are trained to the level the President 
certifies, we bring one home.

If the whole premise of the President's policy was as they stand up, 
we stand down, he has been saying that for such a long time, and that 
was in our supplemental bill that we passed a couple of weeks ago.

I know our good friend Steve Israel from New York and Ike Skelton 
have been promoting this idea for a long time, and that was in there. 
That is the kind of thing that the Democrats are doing.

But to focus on the lack of planning, not to beat a dead horse, but 
we now have soldiers over there who are in charge of two, three, 400 
Iraqi soldiers. One person that I know who is in charge of 400 Iraqi 
soldiers, do you know how many interpreters he has to communicate with?
