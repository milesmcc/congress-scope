Mr. McNULTY. Mr. Speaker, in the spring of 1970, during my first term 
as Town Supervisor of Green Island, I testified against the War in 
Vietnam at a Congressional Field Hearing in Schenectady, New York.

Several months after that testimony, my brother, HM3 William F. 
McNulty, a Navy medic, was killed in Quang Nam Province.

I have thought--many times since then--that if President Nixon had 
listened to the voices of reason back then, my brother Bill might still 
be alive.

As a Member of Congress today, I believe that the Iraq War will 
eventually be recorded as one of the biggest blunders in the history of 
warfare.

In October 2002, I made a huge mistake in voting to give this 
President the authority to take military action in Iraq. I will not 
compound that error by voting to authorize this war's continuation.

On the contrary, I will do all that is within my power to end this 
war, to bring our troops home, and to spare other families the pain 
that the McNulty family has endured every day since August 9, 1970.
