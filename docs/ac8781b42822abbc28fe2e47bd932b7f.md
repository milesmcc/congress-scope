Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, once again, I would state that with 
bipartisan working arrangements we have brought forward a package of 
bills today from the Veterans Committee which deals not only with our 
older veterans, but with our returning veterans from Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and that's what we will continue to do.

I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2623, as amended

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
