Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is the Defense authorization bill. I 
hope there will be a little conversation about this tomorrow. This will 
get us back and focusing on the intractable war that is taking place in 
Iraq.

I made a call a day or two ago to speak to Keith Modgling, the father 
of Josh. He just turned 22. He was in Iraq for less than a month. He 
was killed.

We are going to refocus on this. It is important we do that.
