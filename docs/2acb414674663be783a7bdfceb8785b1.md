Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I opposed the amendments offered by 
Senators Cornyn and Boxer because they were a diversion from the real 
issue before us; namely, the future of our military involvement in 
Iraq. I disagreed with the language used in all of the ads addressed in 
these amendments, but we should not let those ads sidetrack the real 
work of the Senate. I hope the Senate will not get in the habit of 
condemning political speech, even speech that is offensive.
