Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, twenty years ago today, 
I served as an election observer in Bulgaria on behalf of the 
International Republican Institute (IRI)

It was a life changing dream come true for me to experience firsthand 
the birth of liberty in a captive nation, which had been subjected for 
decades to Nazism and Communism. As a lifelong Cold Warrior I always 
promoted victory over Communism. A strong American military developed 
by President Ronald Reagan produced peace through strength and veterans 
today can see with pride more counties than ever as free market 
democracies.

On June 10, 1990, the people of Bulgaria participated in the first 
free elections since the 1930s. It was inspiring to visit polling 
places in the Plovdiv region and witness the young and old 
participating freely. The talented people of Bulgaria were unshackled. 
People did not want to be a slavish Soviet satellite. I have developed 
a lifelong affection for the people of Bulgaria.

Since then, Bulgaria has evolved from the antiquated ''frozen in 
time'' nation of the 1930s to being a vibrant free market democracy of 
today. It is now a valued member of NATO with troops having served in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a dynamic member of the European Union. On 
the evening before the election in Plovdiv I met a musician who 
explained how he was inspired by Armed Forces Radio out of Greece with 
his favorite composer John Philip Sousa--as he stated, ''Stars and 
Stripes Forever.'' I responded, ''Bulgaria Forever.''

Two years ago I visited the training base at Novo Selo where young 
Bulgarian and American troops participate in joint training exercises. 
The American base was the first invited of foreign troops in Bulgaria's 
1225 year history. I particularly appreciate Ambassador Elena 
Poptodrova for her promotion of the Bulgaria-America partnership. I am 
grateful for my first Bulgarian hosts Stefan Stoyanor, his wife 
Elizabeth and daughter Jana. Their warm Bulgarian welcome will never be 
forgotten.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th in the Global War on Terrorism. God Bless Bulgaria.
