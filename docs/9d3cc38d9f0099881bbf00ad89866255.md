Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that I urge support 
of this resolution. As the previous speaker indicated, we passed 
legislation called Water For the Poor, and in our oversight hearing I 
was looking for places like Burkina Faso in Niger that had no water, 
but found that the money was allocated to Iraq and Afghanistan. ''Water 
for the Poor'' was what it was called, not ''Water for the War.''

So we need to be sure that when we pass legislation, that it goes to 
the intended recipients and not for other purposes. If other purposes 
must be done, put them in another budget. There is plenty of money in 
other budgets and no one ever opposes them. So put it over there, and 
leave our Water for the Poor for the countries that are actually and 
really poor.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
