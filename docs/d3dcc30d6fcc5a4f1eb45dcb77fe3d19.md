Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day will soon be upon us. Eighteen 
soldiers from southeast Texas and troops have given their lives in 
Iraq. These are their photographs over here to my left, all 18 of them. 
These are the names of those warriors, the roll call of the fallen:

Staff Sergeant Russell Slay, United States Marine Corps, age 34. He 
was killed on November 9, 2004. He is from Humble, Texas. When Russell 
told his mother he was joining the Marine Corps after high school, he 
told her that he knew she would not like it, but he joined anyway to 
serve his country.

Lance Corporal Wesley Canning, United States Marine Corps, age 21, 
killed November 10, 2004. He is from Friendswood, Texas. He always 
wanted to be a marine and had the ambition to serve for 20 years. He 
was a proud Texan, and when he was home on leave, he bought a new 
pickup truck so he could show his marine buddies his ''Don't Mess with 
Texas'' bumper sticker.

Lance Corporal Fred Lee Maciel, United States Marine Corps, age 20, 
killed January 26, 2005. He was from Spring, Texas. He was killed in a

Iraq to witness those successful elections. Lance Corporal Maciel made 
them possible.

Lance Corporal Ryan Miller, United States Marine Corps, age 19,

And lastly, Mr. Speaker, Lance Corporal Anthony Aguirre, United 
States Marine Corps, age 20, killed February 22, 2007, from 
Channelview, Texas. He entered the Marines because it was the toughest 
branch in the military.

Mr. Speaker, these are the few, the bold, the brave, the courageous, 
the Americans. These are the sons of southeast Texas who have fallen in 
battle for their country.

And that's just the way it is.
