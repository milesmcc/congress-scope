Mr. LEVIN. There is no effort here to impose our view of federalism 
or an outside view of federalism on the Iraqis. It is their view of 
federalism, reflected in their own Constitution, that the Senator has 
viewed as a real potential solution to the violence in the provinces in 
Iraq.

So I wish to thank the Senator from Delaware, and perhaps at this 
point, if I could get the attention of the Senator from Delaware, in 
order to save time later, he and I have entered into a colloquy which 
doesn't need to be made part of the Record at this time, it could be 
put in the Record after the amendment is modified.

So I ask unanimous consent that after the amendment is modified to 
have printed in the Record a colloquy between myself and the Senator 
from Delaware.
