`Mr. HOYER â€” 10 July 2008`

Mr. HOYER. I would not agree with the gentleman. After all, we did 
pass the Iraq funding, we passed a very substantive supplemental, we 
passed a GI bill, we passed an unemployment insurance extension. We 
passed an energy bill last year signed by the President. I think much 
of what we passed in our '06 that was passed, that got through the 
Senate, was signed by the President and supported by a significant 
number of Republicans.

Furthermore, let me just remind you, and I'm sure you recall this, 
that we took 50 hours longer to do the appropriations bills last year 
than we did in 2006 when your side was in charge. And we had extensive 
debate. We had 10 open bills, open rules, and we had two rules at the 
end, because it was clear that we were having great difficulty getting 
our bills done in a time cramp. Even under those bills, we spent hours 
debating them. We spent 17 hours on the Homeland Security bill, for 
instance, and 12 hours on the Labor-Health bill on the floor.
