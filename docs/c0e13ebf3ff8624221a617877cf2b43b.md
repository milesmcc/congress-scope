`Mr. KAUFMAN â€” 20 October 2009`

---


Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to welcome today's announcement of 
a runoff election in Afghanistan, to be held on November 7. This second 
round is absolutely critical, and I commend the Electoral Complaints 
Commission for successfully investigating reports of fraud surrounding 
the August 20 vote. The ECC fulfilled its mandate, and I applaud the 
Afghan people for demonstrating patience and resilience throughout this 
very difficult process.

I also want to recognize the efforts of the chairman of our Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, Senator John Kerry, and Ambassador 
Eikenberry in Afghanistan to secure greater transparency and encourage 
a second round.

When I was in Afghanistan in April, there was great promise that the 
election would usher in a new era of hope for the Afghan people. But 
when I returned to the region in September, it was clear this hope had 
been dashed by allegations of election fraud. Each story of corruption 
further undermines the confidence of the Afghan people in their 
government, which has hemorrhaged endlessly since the August vote. 
Today's news of a runoff gives hope to the Afghan people that their 
voices and political aspirations will finally be heard.


On October 8, I gave a statement on the eighth anniversary of the 
war. In it, I highlighted governance as an essential component of our 
counterinsurgency strategy, particularly because our goal is to build 
support for the Afghan Government among the Afghan people. This battle 
for the hearts and minds is not between the Afghans and Americans; it 
is between the Afghan Government and the Taliban, a Taliban which has 
been bolstered by the allegations of fraud from the August vote.

Counterinsurgency cannot succeed in Afghanistan without a credible 
government. It is my hope that a credible Afghan partner can emerge 
from a second round of elections. Whether the winner is President 
Karzai or Dr. Abdullah, it is critical that the next Afghan Government 
take steps to root out corruption, improve security, and provide 
essential services to the Afghan people.

Just as the United States supports a transparent, fair election, we 
also support a transparent and effective Afghan Government that serves 
the interests of its people. It will be necessary to ensure that the 
mistakes made in August are not repeated in a second round. This is why 
the role of monitors should be strengthened to protect the integrity of 
the vote.

Afghan and international forces should also be present in 
sufficiently strong numbers to provide security and ensure that Afghan 
citizens can safely cast their votes. It is my hope that this second 
round will provide an opportunity to rectify problems encountered in 
August and, most importantly, help to build faith in government among 
the Afghan people.

As President Obama takes the time he needs to thoroughly consider all 
of our options in Afghanistan, issues of governance will inform this 
process because our policy is more than just about combat troop levels; 
it must include the promotion of effective governance, training of 
Afghan security forces, and economic development.

The Afghan people deserve a better and brighter future, and I hope 
this runoff election will bring them one step closer to their goal.

I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
