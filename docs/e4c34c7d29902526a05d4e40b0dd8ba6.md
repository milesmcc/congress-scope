Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, at the end of August the 
goal was achieved of a transition of security in Iraq from an active 
combat role of Americans to the security forces of the people of Iraq. 
All Americans should express gratitude for the courage and resolve of 
our military and military families.

Newsweek's cover page of March 8 declared: ''Victory at Last,'' with 
the emergence of a democratic Iraq. The Wall Street Journal 
editorialized ''Victory in Iraq'' on August 30, citing ''the courage of 
the Americans who will fight in our defense.'' On September 6 the 
Washington Times proclaimed ''Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq.

As the grateful father of two sons who served in Iraq and as 
cochairman of the Victory in Iraq Caucus established with our former 
colleague, Mark Green of Wisconsin, I know firsthand of the 
achievements of the American military personnel. I am confident with 
the leadership of General David Petraeus, based on the Bush success of 
Iraq, that the Obama surge in Afghanistan will promote liberty and 
peace.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
