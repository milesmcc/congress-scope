Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. I guess I am asking him to yield really to a question so I 
can have a better understanding of the gentleman's amendment.

Is it the intent of the gentleman's amendment that these funds would 
somehow not be subject to the benchmarks established in the 
supplemental bill for funding and future funding in Iraq? Is this 
around the benchmarks?
