Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, on Thursday, August 19, 2010, our nation 
lost another brave hero. Army Ranger Specialist Christopher Shane 
Wright was killed in Pech, Afghanistan, from injuries sustained from 
enemy small arms fire. He was 23 years old. A Kentucky resident, 
Specialist Wright's mother currently lives in Jeffersonville, IN.

Specialist Wright was known as a man of courage beyond his years. He 
was deeply loyal and good-hearted. He had an intense love of his family 
and of his fellow soldiers. When told that his grandparents would pray 
for him, he asked that they also pray for the soldiers in his unit as 
well.

Wright joined the Army in 2005. Prior to his 18th birthday, Wright 
expressed a desire to enlist, and within days of turning 18, he did so. 
Wright was a veteran of two prior deployments--once to Iraq, and once 
to Afghanistan.

The loss of Specialist Wright is tragic. His deserves our most 
heartfelt gratitude and respect. Though I did not know him, I mourn his 
death and the loss to his family. He and his loved ones are in my 
prayers.
