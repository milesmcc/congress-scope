Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, our Nation is grieving over this war. 
Every day when we wake up and turn on the TV or the radio, we don't 
know what other horror is befalling our troops. We have a country in 
Iraq where 70 percent of the people want us out of there, where a broad 
majority says it is OK to kill or wound an American soldier, where 
maybe 50-plus percent of the Iraqi Parliament says we should get out on 
a timetable.

It is pretty simple. When I was a kid, my mother said, don't go where 
you are not wanted. Enough is enough. We have given and given and 
given, in blood and in treasury. So I proudly stand before the Senate 
urging my colleagues to do the right thing, to vote for responsible 
redeployment, a responsible end to this war, and join me in voting for 
the Feingold amendment.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.
