Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I would like to begin 
with a quote from Coretta Scott King: ''Struggle is a never ending 
process. Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in every 
generation.''

I rise today to talk about one of America's priorities in the 
emergency supplemental appropriations bill. And that is to fulfill the 
promise to help rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi from Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita.

In August of 2005, the American people saw something that was hard to 
believe. They saw a U.S. Government that was incompetent, a government 
that was inept and a government that didn't care about its own people. 
Unfortunately, 2 days ago, President Bush vetoed the emergency 
supplemental bill and showed the American people that things haven't 
changed.

After the President vetoed the bill, he had the audacity to make the 
following statement: ''. . . the bill is loaded with billions of 
dollars in non-emergency spending that has nothing to do with fighting 
the war on terror. Congress should debate these spending measures on 
their own merits--and not as part of an emergency funding bill for our 
troops.''

Only two people in the country believe that we are winning the war in 
Iraq--they are President Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney. The 
cheese stands alone.

The $1.3 billion for east and west bank levee protection and coastal 
protections isn't pork.

The $30 million for K-12 education assistance has been debated and 
has been deemed essential. The $25 million for Small Business 
Administration disaster loans will help rebuild. The $80 million for 
HUD rental assistance will bring people home. The $4.3 billion for FEMA 
disaster recovery grants is an emergency for our fellow Americans in 
Louisiana and Mississippi who have been waiting 18 months for you to 
keep your promise to rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi.

Mr. President, you were wrong to veto this bill. I have been to New 
Orleans seven times and I am going back in June. Sadly, every time I 
have been back it looks the same--like a war zone.

It's unbelievable that 18 months have passed and the most basic human 
needs are not yet met; 18 months later and residents are not able to 
move back, there is still debris everywhere and people go without 
electricity; 18 months later and there are impassable roads, no clean 
running water, and not enough schools and teachers; 18 months later and 
no street signs, toxic fumes in the air and not enough police officers; 
18 months later this is unacceptable.

The President has been wrong about every major claim he has made, why 
should we believe anything he has to say now? The President said Iraq 
had weapons of mass destruction, and he was wrong. The President said 
al Qaeda was tied to Iraq, and he was wrong. The President said a 
liberated Iraq would bring stability to the region, and he was wrong. 
The President said we would be treated as liberators, and he was wrong. 
The President said oil revenues would pay for the war, and he was 
wrong. The President said ''Mission Accomplished,'' and he was wrong. 
The President was wrong to veto this bill.

My colleagues on the other side made statements over and over again 
about how we should pass a ''clean'' supplemental bill. I would like to 
ask them what is wrong with giving the residents of Louisiana and 
Mississippi the money they deserve? I've been an elected official for 
25 years and I've never seen a clean bill. It is clear to me from 
watching the Republicans that he who holds the gold holds the power.

If the President or my Republican colleagues would have done their 
job 18 months ago, we wouldn't need to have these extra funds in the 
supplemental bill. It is shameful that the very people who write the 
checks and pay taxes in our cities are not getting the money they 
deserve. I remember the President's press conference in Jefferson 
Square in New Orleans and his promise to rebuild. His veto showed the 
America people, once again, that he has no intention of living up to 
that promise. The Democratic majority has done our job by passing this 
bill. Sadly, the residents of Louisiana and Mississippi will have to 
keep on waiting on you to remember your promise.

The good citizens of Louisiana and Mississippi demand good government 
that is responsible and caring and walks the walk and not just talks to 
the talk.
