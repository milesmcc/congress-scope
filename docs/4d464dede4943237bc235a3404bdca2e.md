Mrs. DOLE. The amendment I offer today is critical to our National 
Guard and reservists serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It 
fixes a problem in the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Section 827 of 
that act allows National Guardsmen and reservists called into active 
duty for at least 6 months to make penalty-free early withdrawals from 
their IRA, 401(k), or 403(b) retirement accounts. This provision 
expires at the end of 2007. My amendment, which is fully offset, 
corrects this by extending this important provision through 2012.

Our National Guardsmen and reservists always stand ready to put their 
lives on hold and answer the call of duty. They are putting themselves 
into harm's way to protect our freedoms and security. They can face 
lengthy deployments that cause major financial strains for their 
families. These outstanding men and women should continue to have 
penalty-free access to their retirement savings if they find themselves 
in a deployment-related financial crunch.

I urge passage of the amendment.
