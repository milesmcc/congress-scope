Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, 4 years yesterday, President Bush sent a 
strong message to the American people, to our troops, and to the world, 
that our mission in Iraq was accomplished. Can you imagine that?

Four years later it is clear that this was just one of the many 
miscalculations on Bush's administration's part. Over the past 4 years, 
we have lost more than 3,000 additional troops, tens of thousands more 
have been severely injured, and hundreds of billions of U.S. taxpayers' 
dollars have been spent. Now a dangerous civil war is being waged with 
no end in sight.

The American military did its job. Military experts agree that there 
is no military solution to the war in Iraq. That is why this Congress 
approved an emergency supplemental bill last week that sent a strong 
message to the Iraqi Government that this is the time to get their 
political house in order. American troops are not going to be there 
indefinitely.

Mr. Speaker, President Bush was wrong 4 years ago. He's wrong now as 
he vetoes this bill. It is time for the President to work with this 
Congress to come up with a plan to end this war.
