## `121db3eff70e80d610d61c8548574087`
`Mr. SALI â€” 22 April 2008`

Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant Michael 
T. Lilly of Boise, Idaho. Sergeant Lilly was killed on April 7, 2008 in 
Sadr City, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom when a rocket 
propelled grenade caused an explosion near Sergeant Lilly's position.

While serving the United States, Sergeant Lilly distinguished himself 
amongst fellow soldiers as an enthusiastic, patriotic soldier, 
passionately dedicated to serving his country and defending freedom 
abroad. Sgt. Lilly embodied high caliber leadership in keeping with the 
highest traditions and customs of the United States Army, and his 
guidance will be sorely missed by all of those with whom he served.

Sgt. Lilly was a graduate of Borah High School, a ''Borah Lion.'' At 
the memorial service held in his honor, one of the speakers, former 
Boise Airport police chief and Borah grad Mike Johnson said, ''Lilly 
had the heart of a Lion. Tonight, the Lion sleeps.'' There can be no 
finer tribute to this sterling young man.

I extend to his wonderful family my most sincere condolences and 
express my heartfelt appreciation for the brave men and women like Sgt. 
Lilly who have borne the hardships of battle and perished in the line 
of fire.
