Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I would simply argue that the need for us to 
consider measures under an open amendment process is something I 
support. I am standing here in support of this open rule. I also would 
like to say that the argument for us to come forward and debate issues 
here on the floor is very important. The issue of Iraq was considered 
under an open rule.
