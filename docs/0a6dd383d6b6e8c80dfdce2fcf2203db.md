Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to bring to the House the 
following facts: We have been at this bill now for the better part of 
yesterday. We have been on this bill since 10:30 this morning, and we 
have been trying to negotiate a unanimous consent agreement so that 
Members might be able to leave here tomorrow night. I know there is a 
CODEL of Members going to Iraq but I want to put them on notice now. I 
doubt very much that you are going to make it unless you want to miss a 
lot of votes because as things are developing, I am told that right 
now, because of the insistence that a number of amendments, which we 
have heard time and time again, will still be subjected to 40 minutes' 
debate time even though there are five similar amendments, each of 
which will take about 40 minutes. When you calculate it all, it comes 
out to about 800 minutes of debate time. That means roughly 13 hours. 
By the time you account for slippage, the time it takes for Members to 
be recognized, the time it takes for them to find their amendments, you 
have to add about another 5 hours plus your voting time.

What that means is that if we continue until 1 o'clock this morning, 
it will still probably be required for Members to be here until about 8 
o'clock or later tomorrow night, which means that we will finish just 
in time for you to all miss your planes.

I just wanted you to know that so that if you think that you would 
like to see another result, you talk to individuals who right now seem 
to think that 40 minutes' time on a repetitive amendment is more 
important than ending a filibuster by amendment.

Two years ago when this bill was on the floor, it took about 12 
hours. At this rate it will take about three times that amount of time. 
So I want Members who are coming up to me asking me about whether they 
are going to be able to make their planes or their CODELs, I want them 
to understand that if they miss them, I want them to know who to blame 
because it is not going to be me.
