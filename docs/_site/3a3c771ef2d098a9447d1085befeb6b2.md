Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield myself the 
balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced over 
600,000 new veterans thus far and have created a serious challenge for 
the Nation: how to facilitate our returning servicemembers' successful 
transition back home and into our economy. Given the ongoing nature of 
these conflicts, the shift in economic opportunities and the diverse 
needs of returning veterans, this is an unprecedented situation that 
will require a major and rapid response.

To promote veterans' abilities to be productive engines of the 
economy, I believe we must comprehensively modernize Federal programs 
designed to assist this key group through self-employment 
opportunities. H.R. 4253 achieves this objective by obtaining the Small 
Business Administration programs to ensure they are customized to meet 
the growing needs of this sector in a changing economy.

This Nation has a clear obligation to ensure that our returning 
servicemembers have the assistance they need to succeed at 
entrepreneurship. By complementing their individual strengths with 
appropriate Federal resources, we can help them realize their full 
potential, while also growing the economy.

Madam Speaker, I want to thank the staff that worked on this bill. 
From the majority staff, Michael Day, Adam Minehardt and Andy Jimenez. 
From the minority staff, Barry Pineles and Kevin Fitzpatrick. I also 
want to recognize Max Goodman from Mr. Buchanan's staff and Cara Toman 
and Erik Komendant from Mr. Altmire's staff.

I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4253.
