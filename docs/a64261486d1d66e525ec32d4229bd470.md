Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, after all the fabrications and 
all the incompetence associated with Iraq, not to mention the human 
rights abuses in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, you wouldn't think that 
America could lose any more credibility, but now we understand the 
President was warned well in advance that there was new information on 
Iran's nuclear program; yet he continued with his bellicose rhetoric, 
even raising the specter of World War III.

Well, now we know. There is absolutely no excuse for going to war 
with Iran. But the fact is that if the President is still concerned 
about Iran, which he very much should be, he should read the rest of 
the National Intelligence Estimate which makes it clear that Iran is 
going to acquire even more wealth and, thus, power because of our 
dependency on oil.

So the best thing that the President can do if he's concerned about 
Iran is to sign the energy bill that we are considering today. We 
cannot continue our dependence upon foreign oil, and the first way to 
start moving in a new and more secure direction, is to sign the Energy 
Independence bill that will go to his desk very shortly.
