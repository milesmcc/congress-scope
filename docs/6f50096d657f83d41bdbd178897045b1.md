Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, again I want to 
congratulate Congresswoman McCarthy for her obvious appreciation of the 
veterans of World War II, her obvious sincerity for the veterans of 
World War II. We are so grateful that we have present today veterans 
who are the greatest generation. With my six visits to Iraq and twice 
to Afghanistan, I have seen the new greatest generation, and again, I 
want to congratulate Congresswoman McCarthy for her leadership and urge 
my colleagues to vote in favor of House Concurrent Resolution 42.

Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back my time.
