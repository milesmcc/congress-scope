Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud 
cosponsor of H.R. 1327, the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2009. Iran's 
ambition to become a nuclear power is unquestionably clear, and now is 
the time for debilitating sanctions that will curtail this dangerous 
path.

Despite the assertions of Iranian leaders that they seek to enrich 
uranium for peaceful purposes alone, their actions and obfuscation 
suggest otherwise. Further, President Ahmadinejad has continued to 
cause international frustration through comments he made at the United 
Nations summit in September. His efforts also go far beyond words. On 
numerous occasions, Ahmadinejad has tested mid to long range missiles, 
and in February 2009, Iran launched a low-orbit rocket that is the 
necessary first step to firing an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
Further, intelligence sources point to Iran's ready capability of 
firing short, medium, and long range missiles that endanger our brave 
men and women deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq.

I therefore do not support President Obama's cuts to missile defense 
in the FY10 National Defense Authorization Act. In fact, I believe that 
we are putting our friends and allies at risk, as well as the eastern 
shore of the United States. However, if this chamber is forced to rely 
so heavily on economic sanctions, we must encourage and enable American 
divestment from Iran to squeeze their economy to a point that will rein 
in their dangerous ambitions.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
