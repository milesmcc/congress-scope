Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Well, what do you know, Mr. Speaker. After 
months of drum beat urging that we take a more aggressive posture 
toward Iran, mention by the President of a potential World War III, the 
assumptions, the assertions by the White House that Iran is 
aggressively pursuing a nuclear weapons program, we now find that as 
with Iraq, this was not true.

But, differently from what happened with Iraq, this time those 
professional, courageous civil servants in our national intelligence 
agencies stood up to intimidation from the White House and spoke the 
truth objectively and detailed it with facts. We're very proud of them.

All the more reason why we should not yield to the President's 
threats to furlough over 200,000 civilian employees and contractors 
just before Christmas unless the Congress approves another $50 billion 
in war spending.

Mr. Speaker, we need to stick to our guns. We've approved $459 
billion in defense spending. That's enough.
