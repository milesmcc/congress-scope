`Mr. RYAN of Ohio â€” 31 January 2007`

---


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. No consistency. What they said last year, they did 
not do this year. What they did last year, they do not want us to do. 
There is no consistency to their argument at all. Consistency is the 
word for today, the lack thereof on the Republican side.

As we close, because I know we just have a few minutes left, and I 
want to yield back to my friend from Florida, I think it is very 
interesting what we are seeing happening already. We talked a lot in 
the last couple of years about oversight and that when the Democrats 
were in charge, Mr. Speaker, we were going to provide oversight.

Now, we start seeing things open up in Iraq, with all these 
contracts, from all these big corporations who were getting all these 
big government contracts, all of the sudden you are starting to see 
come out of these committee hearings exactly what has been going on. 
Now you are starting to see maybe the administration was strong arming 
some scientists to spin global climate change data. You are starting to 
see this all percolate up.

I think one of the other things we said we are going to do is execute 
our constitutional obligation to provide oversight, and we are seeing 
that, and we are seeing the results of that with the global warming, 
with the war in Iraq, things happening, that didn't happen in Katrina, 
all starting to rise up.

I want to thank the gentleman from the Pittsburgh area and the 
gentleman from Connecticut, my two favorite people from Florida. I want 
to thank you and I yield to Ms. Wasserman Schultz for her closing 
remarks.
