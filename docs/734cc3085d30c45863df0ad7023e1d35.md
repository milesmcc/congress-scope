# WASHINGTON WEEK

`Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas â€” 24 June 2010`

Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have had a good week, and I 
am very grateful we had the opportunity today to say to the doctors of 
America that we are committed to your practice and your medicine and 
your caring for our seniors.

In addition, we were able to say to Iran, which has called for the 
extinguishing of Israel, has caused the existence of Camp Ashraf in 
Iraq, and literally has tried to destroy dissidents and resisters for 
democracy, that we will not tolerate an Iran that is nuclear-armed. And 
so I am glad that we passed the Iran Sanctions Act.

But we have more to do. And I am grateful that the President saw fit 
to change command in Afghanistan. It is unfortunate that the commands 
of the commander in chief were not respected, but we know that this is 
a civilian government and the military respects the civilian 
leadership. That must be. But now we must turn to establishing a 
pathway out of Afghanistan. We must go after the terrorists that 
threaten us, but we must recognize a smart power, political power, 
diplomatic power, empowering the people, providing for education is the 
way to solve the Afghanistan problem, not 30,000 soldiers that are 
engaged in war.
