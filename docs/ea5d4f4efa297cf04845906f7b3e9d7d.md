Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, the sudden and unexpected passing of 
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke has been very, very sad news for 
Americans, and it obviously has sent shock waves throughout the 
international community.

Dick Holbrooke is someone with whom I was privileged to work on a 
number of issues over the past decade and a half. And I will say that 
he was known for being rough-and-tumble. He was described by one as 
''the bulldozer diplomat.''

But I have to say that Dick Holbrooke was a true polyglot. He knew, 
in dealing with diplomatic challenges, that it took different talents 
and different styles. Regardless of where he was in the world, he was 
able to apply his unique talents. I have to say that we worked together 
on a number of very important issues.

As we look at the challenge that exists today in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan, his passing will be a real loss for that effort. But his 
passing should lead us to redouble our commitment to pursue the goal 
that I believe Dick Holbrooke always pursued, and that was for peace, 
stability, the rule of law, and self-determination around the world.

Our thoughts and prayers go to his wife and two sons.
