# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `1bc46cd0e74299b220732743bcf60fd4`
`Mr. SKELTON â€” 13 February 2007`

Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, once again my friends on the other side of 
the aisle are attempting to confuse the conflict in Iraq with the war 
against terrorists and has their genesis in Afghanistan, trying to put 
it all in one basket. That is not the case. Anybody can have their own 
opinion, but, Mr. Speaker, they may not have their own facts.

Mr. Speaker, I now yield 5 minutes to my colleague from California 
(Mr. Thompson), a gentleman who is a Vietnam combat veteran of the 
173rd Airborne Brigade.
