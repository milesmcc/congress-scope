Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office 
just released an analysis that on top of the half a trillion dollars 
that we have already spent on the war in Iraq, it will cost us another 
$2 trillion over the next decade. That includes $564 million of 
interest, because every dime of this war in Iraq has been borrowed, 
from our children and from our grandchildren. It will come to a greater 
cost than the cost of the Korean, the Vietnam War and all three 
theaters of operation in World War II. It boils down to about $7,000 
for every man, woman and child.

And here we thought the only real sacrifice was being borne by our 
soldiers and their families. We are beginning to see the real 
implications for all of America. In fact, just last week, the President 
vetoed a bill that would have cost $35 billion but would have provided 
health care to 10 million children over the next 5 years and at the 
same time demanded that we instead spend that same amount of money for 
3 weeks in Iraq. This is not what America expects from its President or 
its Congress, Madam Speaker.
