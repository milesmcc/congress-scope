Mr. PENCE. Last week, President George W. Bush outlined a new 
strategy and new tactics in our war in Iraq; he called it, ''The Way 
Forward.'' Sadly, many in Congress and many around the country want to 
go backwards; to redeploy, to undo our military commitment to freedom 
in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I understand this temptation, even though I disagree 
with it. It is always tempting to go backwards, always tempting to want 
to go back before loss and hardship and war. The Old Book tells us 
otherwise, reading, ''Forgetting what is behind, I press on.''

Winston Churchill gave us this counsel: ''One ought never to turn 
one's back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it; if you 
do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and 
without flinching, you will reduce the danger by half.'' So said 
Winston Churchill.

I support our Commander in Chief. I support our new way forward. We 
must come together as a Nation. We must decide as a Nation not to see 
freedom fail in Iraq.
