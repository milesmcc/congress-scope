Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I have said several times today that our new 
Members have been very aggressive and active in extending the rights 
and care for our Nation's veterans. The same is true for Mr. Patrick 
Murphy from Pennsylvania, a new Member, our only Iraqi veteran, in 
fact, serving in the Congress, and has dedicated a lot of time to 
making sure his comrades get the health care and attention and benefits 
that they need.

I would yield to him 3 minutes.
