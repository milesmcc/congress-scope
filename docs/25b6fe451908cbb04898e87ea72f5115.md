Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, why is it we have finite resources for 
health care but unlimited money for war? The inequities in our economy 
are piling up: trillions for war, trillions for Wall Street, tens of 
billions for insurance companies. Banks and other corporations are 
sitting on piles of cash and taxpayers' money, while firing workers, 
cutting pay, and denying small businesses money to survive.

People are losing their homes, their jobs, their health, their 
retirement security. Yet there is unlimited money for war and Wall 
Street and insurance companies but very little money for jobs. There is 
unlimited money to blow up things in Iraq and Afghanistan, relatively 
little money to build things in the U.S.

The administration will soon bring to Congress a request for an 
additional $50 billion for war. I can tell you, a Democratic version of 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is no more acceptable than a 
Republican version of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trillions for 
war, for Wall Street, billions for insurance companies. When we were 
promised change, we weren't thinking it meant we give a dollar and get 
back 2 cents.
