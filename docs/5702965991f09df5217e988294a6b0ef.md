Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4899, the 
Supplemental Appropriations Act.

While I am extremely disappointed that the House is not simply 
passing the Senate-passed version of this bill and clearing it for the 
President's signature, I will ultimately support this bill. It is my 
belief that voting against this bill even in its current form would 
send a terrible signal to our troops that we do not support their 
efforts and that is unacceptable to me. And, while I still believe this 
is the wrong vehicle for it, I am pleased that the domestic spending 
that is included in this legislation is offset and will not add to our 
deficit.

We must act as soon as possible to get critical military and Federal 
Emergency Management Agency funding legislation to the President for 
his signature. Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and families across 
America who have been affected by disasters cannot afford anymore 
delays in funding.
