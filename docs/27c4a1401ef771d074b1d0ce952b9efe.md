`Mr. WALBERG â€” 20 November 2008`

---


Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Corporal Travis 
Webb from Adrian, Michigan who was injured in an improvised explosive 
device (IED) blast in Mosul, Iraq on January 22, 2007. He lost both 
legs and his best friend Nicholas Brown died in his arms after the 
blast. The following poem is dedicated to a true American hero, Travis 
Webb.














 A Soldier's Story



 Throughout our Nation's history


 Such magnificent men of honor and glory, have so been seen


 Who so went, where angel's feared to tread


 Who went off to war


 All for us, the ones who so lived and died and so bled


 All so we could be here!


 As this is a soldier's story!


 All about Heartbreak, Faith and Glory


 All about life and death


 As he put himself in harm's way, as his best friend died in 





 his arms that day


 When courage comes to crest!


 All about a young man from Michigan . . . Travis, and his 





 heroic stand


 As all of us, he would so bless


 Who came out of such hell and fury!




 A Hero from The 2-7 Cav . . . 11 Bravo, Corporal Webb, his 





 soldier's story


 A fighting force to be feared, who gave all he had so very 





 clear


 A Soldier's Story


 Who, into that valley of death . . . so walked


 All with his two fine legs, as was our freedom bought!


 His charge, his thought's


 The life of Travis Webb, so much to all has taught


 All about courage and faith


 As this mighty Michigander makes his way


 As no other's could so take his place


 As throughout his young life, his flow and ebb


 Through the good and bad!


 A work of art, to be said!


 As it all began


 With a young man with no direction


 Until, he found his life's true passion . . . his reflection


 Reaching, his greatest introspection


 His fine reflection, in a Uniform


 As A Soldier's Heart and soul, so proud and bold . . . so 





 very warm


 All for his country 'tis a thee


 As a future Hero was born, as we would see


 While, on battlefields of honor and death and gore


 Charging bravely so, so ever . . . ever forth!


 When, Looking down


 As there it was he so found, no more


 His two strong fine legs, which made up this most valiant 





 force


 While, there in that moment of truth


 As in that moment we find the answer, the proof


 All about what courage, and a magnificent heart can do!


 To build where none lie left


 To climb the highest of all mountains, no less


 To Teach Us all . . . to so bless


 To Reach Us . . . to so Beseech Us, all no less


 To But Be The Best


 When, Courage comes to Crest


 Day by Day


 Night after Night


 To win the battle, to win that fight!


 As he will not give up, will not rest!


 As is this soldier's story, our hearts have blessed


 As we watch him grow


 For he has a life to live


 And to this our world, so much more to give!


 Could such faith and courage, we so know? Possess?


 And, if I ever have a son


 I, but hope and pray . . . that he could so be like this fine 





 one!


 Shining, all in Faith's True Son


 A Soldier's Story, Travis Webb our hearts have won!


 All in our Lord's Heart, that will be done


 Amen!
