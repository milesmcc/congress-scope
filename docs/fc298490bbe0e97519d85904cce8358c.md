Mr. SALAZAR. I thank my colleagues for the colloquy. I do think this 
debate has had an impact. I do remember well the conversations we had 
in the room with the President after we came back from Iraq. There was 
a conversation where the President said that our sending this message 
to the Iraqi people was a very important message, and certainly Senator 
Levin and Senator Warner have been a part of making sure that message 
is, in fact, heard.

Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?
