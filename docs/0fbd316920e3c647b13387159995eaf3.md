`Mr. KENNEDY â€” 26 September 2007`

Mr. KENNEDY. Effectively, when the administration says this is going 
to be additional kind of spending, they leave out the fact that it is 
going to be funded--children's health--with a cigarette tax. Is the 
Senator familiar with the fact that the procedure, the process by which 
the children actually get the health insurance in the State is 
basically identical to what the administration asked on their 
prescription drug program? It is using the private sector in terms of 
the contract, and in terms of an individual getting coverage for their 
children. The worker will find out there are several alternatives from 
which they can make a choice. They are all based on the private sector.


Therefore, I ask the Senator, is he somewhat troubled by the 
administration's opposition, since we have effectively tracked the 
delivery system that the administration has asked and it is being paid 
for independently from spending programs by the Federal Government and 
that the total expenditure, as the Senator I am sure has pointed out, 
is some $35 million over 5 years as compared to $120 billion dollars 
for the war in Iraq in a single year?
