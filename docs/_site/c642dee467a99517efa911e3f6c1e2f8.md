Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, one of our new Members, Congressman Murphy 
from Pennsylvania, returned from Operation Iraqi Freedom. He gives us 
the benefit of that experience both as an advocate for our active duty 
and to the veterans who have served. We welcome you to the Congress. We 
thank you for your expertise, and I yield as much time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
