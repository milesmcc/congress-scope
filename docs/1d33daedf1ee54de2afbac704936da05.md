`Mr. CONAWAY â€” 19 March 2007`

Mr. CONAWAY. Let me finish off, and I will yield back for a little 
bit. We are talking about young men and women's lives who have 
volunteered to do a fight for us on our behalf, to fight an enemy that 
is really bad individuals, to stand between us and those bad 
individuals.

I even hesitate to bring this point up, but you look at this 
supplemental that has been proposed, an additional $21.8 billion added 
to it, and I would argue, and I am, on an individual basis, were it not 
in this bill, I would be for it. I think we have got some disaster 
relief and some other kinds of things that we could be for, but it 
appears to be an attempt to circumvent the PAYGO rules, that this, the 
other side beat our heads about, beat us about the head and shoulders 
with all during the campaign. In other words, if you declare the milk 
thing a disaster, then it doesn't have to be held up to PAYGO.

All of this emergency spending is outside the PAYGO rules under the 
Democrat leadership. So they have spoken with forked tongue, so to 
speak, that they would cling to the PAYGO rules, and yet on this first 
big appropriations bill, they come whistling in here with an additional 
$21.8 billion.

I would even question part of the $103 billion that the President 
proposed. I am not sure that Katrina is still an emergency. Yeah, we 
have issues in Katrina. Yeah, we have issues with what is going on in 
New Orleans, and we have a got a lot of money in the pipeline backed 
up. I think we ought to figure that out first before we throw 
additional moneys at it.

So the $99 billion that is for the war fight, for the reset, for the 
troops that are in harm's way, we would, I think most all of us would 
agree on. But beyond that we have got some real challenges from a 
spending standpoint. Those issues pale in comparison to putting a hard 
deadline on getting out of Iraq and the serious consequences that that 
leaves our military commanders on the ground.
