Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I appreciate those comments. 
Also, another former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Colin Powell, has 
actually come out and said that it is now time to reevaluate it. So in 
conclusion, Mr. Speaker, to the men and women at home, across our 
country and overseas in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, now is the 
time to act in the sense of urgency to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell. It 
is vital to our national security. No longer can we afford to let go of 
13,000 qualified and honorable troops. We must do right by our 
taxpayer. It makes no sense that we spend $1.3 billion to train these 
heroes up and then to just kick them out because of their sexual 
orientation.

And lastly, this policy is simply un-American. It goes against the 
very fabric which makes our country great, that we're all created 
equal.
