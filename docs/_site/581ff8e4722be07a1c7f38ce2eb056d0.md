Mrs. MALONEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the war 
supplemental funding bill.

After years of war that have strained our military, their families, 
and the country, I cannot continue to support funding for the war in 
Afghanistan--a war marked by increasing violence and attacks on our 
troops and no clear definition of success.

The last time this measure was before us, I voted with my colleague 
Rep. Barbara Lee on her amendment to prevent an escalation and limit 
funding to the safe and orderly withdrawal of our troops and military 
contractors from Afghanistan.

I also voted in favor of the McGovern-Obey amendment that would 
require the President to provide Congress with a plan for the 
expeditious redeployment of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and a timeline 
for completion of the redeployment.

But the bill before us is simply a continuation of a policy that 
needs to be changed--with no accountability and no debate on the merits 
of continuing this conflict in a country beset by corruption and 
seemingly endless violence.

Contained in this bill is badly needed funding for Haiti, disaster 
relief and funds for our veterans, which I wholeheartedly support and 
would urge a separate up or down vote.

But a vote for this bill before us today is a vote to continue this 
war and the time has come to bring our troops home.

Reports of corruption abound in Afghanistan, and without a true 
partner in the Karzai government, our prospects for making real 
progress have grown dim.

In recent days, even more troubling reports have come out of the 
region indicating that Pakistan intelligence may be collaborating with 
elements of the Taliban against the United States. With claims such as 
these coming to light, how can we move forward with business as usual 
on the war?

I cannot in good conscience vote to continue funding this war at so 
high a cost and with no guarantee that our efforts are reaching our 
goals there and keeping the American people safe.

That is why I vote ''no'' today.
