`Mr. MARTINEZ â€” 14 March 2007`

---


Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, we have been discussing this topic now 
for some time, and it seems that there are a succession of ways in 
which to fail.

The Democratic leadership in the Senate is looking to persuade the 
American people that our national security would improve if we 
immediately withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq and provided our enemies 
with a timetable and roadmap for our withdrawal. This is exactly what 
S. Res. 9 would do. It would require the beginning of the withdrawal of 
U.S. troops from Iraq within 120 days.

The distinguished Senator from Connecticut said he didn't even think 
that was acceptable; that it should be even less than 120 days. So the 
underlying goal is to remove all U.S. combat forces by March 31, 2008. 
There will be exceptions for those who will stay to protect personnel 
and to do the training of Iraqi forces, but the overall premise is to 
diminish the U.S. presence in Iraq. To that end, I ask: What is the 
goal, just withdrawal or success? If all we are about is withdrawing, 
there are many ways to do that. This timetable might be appropriate, if 
that were the only goal. But if the goal is success, if the goal is the 
opportunity for Iraq to succeed in its effort at democracy, a different 
plan must be followed.

Setting artificial, arbitrary timelines for withdrawal has been 
opposed by Republicans, Democrats, our military leaders, and the Iraq 
Study Group. In the words of the Democratic leader on January 31, 2005:




 As far as setting a timeline, as we learned in the Balkans, 


 that is not a wise decision, because it only empowers those 


 who don't want us there, and it doesn't work well to do that.


In the words of the current chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, in June of 2005:




 A deadline for pulling out will only encourage our enemies 


 to wait us out.


Let me repeat that: It will only encourage our enemies to wait us out 
if we give a deadline.

Democrats are trying to bring before us the 17th version of how we 
would manage the war in Iraq. Seventeen plans in less than 2 months and 
none lead to victory. Can you imagine if the commanders on the ground 
actually had to take orders from the Senate? Thankfully, in our scheme 
of Government and the way our Government was set up, we only have one 
Commander in Chief, one person giving the orders to our armed services 
so that they might succeed at our endeavors.

This attempt to micromanage the war at every level by Senate 
resolutions is not what our Government should do at a time of war. The 
President put together a new plan and a new team. General Petraeus is 
on the ground as the Iraq allied commander, and Admiral Fallon with the 
Central


Command. Both of these distinguished military leaders testified they 
supported the current plan, and this Senate confirmed General Petraeus 
by a vote of 81 to 0.

So now what is our message? We send you to war but we don't want you 
to execute your plan?

We are so fond of this whole atmosphere of anti-Bush and the 
President that we forget that this is a plan that General Petraeus, our 
military leader on the ground in Iraq, has said he believed was a plan 
that had a reasonable chance for success. So I say give General 
Petraeus and his plan a chance for success on the field.


Our forces have not suffered a single military defeat in this entire 
episode. Obviously, we have had some losses, and a high cost in lives 
and injuries and treasure, but we have not had a single military 
defeat. The sacrifice of our troops, their sacrifice, must be for a 
purpose: a state of Iraq that is not a failed state.

In hearing after hearing in the Armed Services Committee, I have 
listened to our military leaders, as well as intelligence experts, give 
us the same message, and their message is clear: A precipitous 
withdrawal from Iraq would almost surely result in a failed state, and 
a failed Iraqi state would be a disaster for the Middle East and our 
own national security.

I would suggest a rapid exit from Iraq is not in America's best 
national interest. I urge my Democratic colleagues to articulate how 
exiting Iraq, allowing chaos to reign, allowing thugs to rule the 
streets, and fear to rule the hearts of the Iraqi people will make 
America safer.

For years, my Democratic colleagues have been calling for a change of 
course. Well, President Bush provided one, a way forward politically, 
economically, and militarily. The new team, a new commander, and our 
commanders in the field, have said we need more troops, and the 
President provided them.

By the way, early indications are that things are a little 
encouraging. American and Iraqi forces, side by side, are walking in 
the streets of Sadr City as we speak. It is too soon to tell, but so 
far, I, for one, am encouraged. This may just work. Why not give it a 
chance?

The Democrats have provided 17 plans. None will give Iraq a chance to 
succeed. I have a plan. Let's support our troops by providing them the 
funding they need and allowing those responsible for executing the war 
to do their job. Let the generals on the field run the war.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle try every day to equate 
this global war on terror to Vietnam. I do not believe there are many 
similarities, but I believe there is one. That war, Vietnam, was lost 
in Washington, and this one can be, too. Let's not do that.

The distinguished junior Senator from New York said it best on 
September of 2005:




 I don't believe it is smart to set a date for withdrawal. I 


 don't think you should ever telegraph your intentions to the 


 enemy so they can await you.


That statement was true then, and I believe it to be true today.

During this debate, I want to hear how nonbinding resolutions, 
dragged out over several weeks, Saturdays included, resolutions with 
the sole purpose to undermine our Commander in Chief, will do anything 
but confuse our troops, embolden our enemy, and complicate our efforts 
to combat terrorism and support this young democracy in the heart of 
the Middle East.

I oppose S. Res. 9. It is wrong for Iraq, it is wrong for the Iraqi 
people, it is wrong for the stability of the Middle East, and it is 
wrong for the national security of the United States.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
