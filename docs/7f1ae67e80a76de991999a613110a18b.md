# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `7f1ae67e80a76de991999a613110a18b`
`Mr. KING of New York â€” 14 February 2007`

Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would just comment on the 
remarks of my good friend, the gentleman from Kansas, as to troops that 
he has heard from. I know I have visited Iraq a number of times. I 
visit Reserves, National Guard, regular troops, active duty, and I have 
never seen morale higher in any Armed Forces.

I speak with troops when they come home to my district. I go to the 
wakes and funerals of those who die from my district. And I think we 
can pick and choose as to what we say. I would say the overwhelming 
majority I have spoken to do support and know exactly why they are 
there.

But again, I just lost a constituent the other day. His family 
certainly is honored by his service. It was his third tour. He went 
back for a third tour. So he certainly understood what was going on.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlelady from Tennessee, a 
member of the Homeland Security Committee (Mrs. Blackburn).
