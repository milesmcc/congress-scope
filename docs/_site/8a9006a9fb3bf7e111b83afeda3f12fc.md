Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my extreme 
disappointment over the deplorable living conditions that our brave men 
and women of the Armed Services have been subjected to upon returning 
home from their courageous service in Iraq.

How can the same administration that is calling on these young 
soldiers to put their lives in harm's way over and over again, allow 
them, after they are subsequently injured, to come back to these 
shameful living conditions?

As a veteran, myself, I am truly ashamed and appalled. When our brave 
warriors are treated like second class citizens, after being injured 
fighting for the values and interests of this country, it sends a very 
dangerous signal to those presently serving in Iraq, as well as to 
those who are considering serving their country through military 
service.

Let us fix this mess today, and make the welfare of our Armed Service 
members a real priority, instead of treating them like pawns in this 
administration's war games.
