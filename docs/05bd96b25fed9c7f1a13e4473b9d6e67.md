`Mr. McCONNELL â€” 7 September 2007`

Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will not be 
objecting, I want to underscore that the speech to which the majority 
leader referred will be the maiden speech of our new Senator from 
Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso. That will be Monday. I look forward to hearing 
what he has to say.

Also, the majority leader indicated we will be discussing the way 
forward on our next Iraq debate, how to structure it in a way that is 
fair to all interested parties. The majority leader and I will be 
continuing to discuss that matter in the coming days.
