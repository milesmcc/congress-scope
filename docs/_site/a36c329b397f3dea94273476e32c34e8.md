`Mr. WEBB â€” 22 May 2007`

---


Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I did not come to 
the floor to speak on this amendment. I have long admired the Senator 
from North Dakota in his sometimes lonely attempts to preserve the 
well-being of the American worker. But I couldn't sit and listen to his 
comments without saying a few words in support of this amendment.

There seems to be a trend running through the Congress that disturbs 
me. It is a trend of omission. I do not see enough people who are 
willing to stand up and speak on behalf of the people who are doing the 
hard jobs in this society. We can talk about all the benefits of 
different portions of this bill, but at the same time we are faced with 
a set of realities, not only with respect to the American workers but, 
in a broader sense, with respect to people in this country who are 
having to do the hard work of our society. Who is speaking for them? 
This used to be the function of the Democratic Party, to speak for 
them.

We are in a situation in this country right now where corporate 
profits are at an all-time high as a percentage of our national wealth. 
Yet wages and salaries as a percentage of our national wealth are at an 
all-time low. How does this happen? One of the ways that it happens is 
exactly what the Senator from North Dakota is talking about. We have 
these programs that benefit Wall Street, and they are not necessarily 
benefiting the people who are doing the hard work of our society, the 
wage earners who are getting cut out because of an underground economy.

I support, in many ways, the move toward giving permanent status to 
people who have come to this country illegally at one point and who 
have put down roots and who want to move into the mainstream of our 
society. But this particular portion of this bill is not designed to do 
that. It is designed to increase the difficulties that we already have. 
It is not a compromise, it is a fabrication.

I have that concern also when it comes to what we are doing on the 
Iraq bill. We are sending a supplemental back right now that is not in 
any way going to support the troops who are having to do the hard work 
in Iraq. We are going to be talking about benchmarks.

There is nobody in the Pentagon, there is nobody in the 
administration, there are precious few people in the United States 
Congress who are aware, in a measurable way, of what we are doing to 
the well-being of the ground troops who are having to go back to Iraq 
again and again.

If this is a conflict that is requiring that sort of commitment on 
the ground, then why isn't the administration talking differently about 
the number of troops it needs? Because the people who volunteered to go 
in the military are supposed to go again and again and do their duty.

Well, they are probably on their third and their fourth tours. I put 
in a bill, along with Senator Hagel, that said you cannot send anybody 
back to Iraq unless they have been home as long as they have been gone. 
That, to me, is common sense if you have ever been deployed. I have had 
a father who was deployed. I have been deployed. I have had a son who 
has been deployed. I know what it is like. There are a lot of people 
who know what it is like. Unfortunately, they do not seem to be forcing 
the administration on that end.

We see it in areas such as what has happened to our gas prices here. 
We are going to get a vote on the Attorney General, apparently, a no-
confidence vote. How about getting a vote on how the American people 
are getting ripped off at the pump? Those things can be documented. You 
can have all of the economic theories in the world about why these gas 
prices are going up. Gas was $24 a barrel when we went into Iraq. It is 
now close to $70. The people who are making money off of that are 
making money largely off of foreign policy.
