`Mr. MEEK of Florida â€” 20 March 2007`

---


Mr. MEEK of Florida. Guess what, the American people have said, I 
don't like that. I don't want to do that any more.

So now we have the opportunity to put the language in the bill that 
would hopefully get us to the point where the Iraqi Government will 
say, wow, the U.S. Government is no longer playing around with us. The 
American people are no longer playing around with us.


We will actually have to perform. We will actually have to turn out the 
troops and keep the retention as it relates to our security forces and 
to secure our own country. We are not going to be there forever. We are 
going to make sure of that.

For those that are saying we have to be there as long as we have to 
be there, I am saying that there has to be benchmarks. I am saying $500 
billion has been spent in this war thus far and will continue to be 
spent unless someone stands up and takes the responsibility on.

I commend the Speaker, commend the leadership, commend every Member 
that has put their shoulder to the wheel and said this must be done 
now, not next year, not 3 years from now, not maybe we will think about 
it one day. The bottom line is there are folks here saying we don't 
want to let down Iraqi people but, guess what, I don't want to let down 
a U.S. taxpayer.

I don't want to let down that individual that is sitting in a 
veterans hospital now hoping and wishing they could get the kind of 
good care if the Congress was to stand behind them. It's not a gift 
issue as it relates to the majority here in this House. It is when we 
vote on this bill Thursday the they will be able to see the 
accountability they deserve. We have a process, get it through to the 
President.

This President can go on and on about how he will veto it, but I 
remember all of the tough talk. I have gone to the White House; I have 
spoken to the President. I don't have to talk in third party. I have 
done that. I don't have to have someone tell me what the President 
said.



The President said, even in his speech as it relates to the 
escalation of troops, well, we know that the people know that, yes, 
they are passing a nonbinding resolution now. It is nonbinding, but 
there will be a binding resolution as it relates to the emergency 
supplemental. And I agree with the President; yes, it was nonbinding, 
and, yes, we had a vote. And I told the President that bill will pass 
overwhelmingly against your initiative and escalation of troops in 
Iraq. He said, yes, Kendrick, I do know that will happen, but there 
will be a binding resolution. And this is the binding resolution. And 
if the President wants a blank check, he is just not going to get it. 
And he has to come through this House of Representatives, he has to go 
through the Senate. And it is something we have to hold this 
government's feet to the fire, the Iraqi Government's feet to the fire, 
or you might as well start going back home, Members, and sharing with 
your constituents, how old is your son? Oh, he's 12? Well, he is going 
to be going to Iraq one day, and he is going to do it because it is 
going to continue to go on and on and on if we keep following the Bush 
philosophy.

And there is nothing wrong with our volunteer force. We have some 
individuals that graduated from high school and want to go into the 
Army. I am all for that. I help recruit on behalf of armed services. 
But I think it is important that we do not give our men and women a 
fixed deck because we weren't man enough and woman enough and leader 
enough to vote on their behalf for their accountability measures so 
they will have what they need when they go into theater.
