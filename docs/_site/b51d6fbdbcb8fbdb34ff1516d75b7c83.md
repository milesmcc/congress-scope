`Mrs. MALONEY â€” 28 July 2010`

Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, this week, yesterday, we approved billions 
for the war in Afghanistan but Congress has yet to fully address the 
impact of the events that caused the war in the first place, the 9/11 
terrorist attacks. On 9/11, thousands of Americans were murdered and 
killed in the first act of the war on terror on our soil, but thousands 
more on that day lost their health when they ran into burning buildings 
to save the lives of others. Nine long years after the attack, we have 
yet to approve guaranteed help for the first responders that risked 
their lives for others.

The House will soon vote on the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, a 
bill that provides health care and compensation to the thousands of 
Americans that came from almost every congressional district around 
this country to help others. The bill is fully paid for and meets our 
moral responsibility to help those who came to the aid of our Nation in 
one of America's darkest hours.

I urge my colleagues from across the country to support this 
patriotic bill.
