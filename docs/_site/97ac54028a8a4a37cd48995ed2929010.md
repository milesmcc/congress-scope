Address of Receiving Entity: 13859 Progress Blvd., Alachua, FL 32615.

Description of Request: I have secured $1,200,000 in funding in H.R. 
2368 in the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Army account 
for the Accelerating Treatment for Trauma Wounds project.

The project goal is to evaluate doxycycline gel for its ability to 
expedite healing of open wounds among injured U.S. Army soldiers at 
Walter Reed Army Medical Center when used in conjunction with other 
good wound care practices. Orally-taken doxcycline has been approved 
and marketed for decades for treatment of infections caused by 
susceptible microorganisms. When used in conjunction with, and not a 
substitute for, good wound care practices including wound cleaning and 
dressing, doxcycline gel has been shown to increase the incidence of 
wound closure and reduce the incidence of infection. This product has 
been approved for human testing.

There is a critical need for effective, low-cost, easy-to-apply 
treatments to address military trauma/open wounds. U.S. soldiers 
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with severe trauma/open wounds must 
remain in hospital care for 6-12 weeks until the wound is sufficiently 
healed. The U.S. military community is seeking cost-effective and easy 
to apply treatments that can speed the rate of healing to 1-2 weeks.

Description of Request: I have secured $3,000,000 in funding in H.R. 
2368 in the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Army account 
for the Center for Excellence for Military Operations in Urban Terrain 
and Cultural Training, MOUT-CT, project at Camp Blanding, FL.

The R&D Center of Excellence for Joint MOUT CT will be at the FL 
National Guard Camp Blanding's existing MOUT site and will perform 
research, development, and testing of new MOUT technologies, focusing 
on Cultural and Unconventional Environments. The R&D Center will 
integrate these new capabilities into existing MOUT capabilities and 
make these capabilities available to the services' MOUT training 
programs. Soldiers and Marines will validate these new capabilities at 
the Florida's National Guard MOUT facility (Camp Blanding) in a 
holistic, immersive, urban and unconventional environment (Live, 
Virtual and Constructive). Once tested and integrated, these new 
capabilities will be available for fielding to all Services and CONUS 
and OCONUS MOUT training centers. The R&D Center for MOUT CT will be 
the centralized integrator for new and existing MOUT technologies and 
will function as the operational link between R&D and training 
requirements.

The R&D Center for MOUT CT will improve the training that Soldiers 
and Marines (and


Special Ops) receive in the area of cultural and unconventional warfare 
issues. By performing the R&D and integration of MOUT training 
technologies at this center, operational training availability will 
increase (i.e., more training days will be available) at existing MOUT 
training centers in CONUS and OCONUS.

Description of Request: I have secured $800,000 in funding in H.R. 
2368 in the Operations and Maintenance, Navy account for the 
Sustainable Maintenance and Repair Technologies for Aircraft Composites 
at the Fleet Readiness Center, Southeast.

This project will provide direct support to the Fleet Readiness 
Center Southeast, FRCSE, to conduct the demonstration and validation 
required to introduce new materials, techniques, and processes into the 
repair, maintenance, and testing of aircraft composite components. The 
program will evaluate newer modern electrical testing, analysis 
capability and repair capability, to include stripping, repairing, 
coatings application and electrical testing to insure attainment of 
both structural and electrical properties of composite components, 
including radomes, radar reflectors and other composite structures.

Many aircraft or aircraft components are constructed of a high 
percentage of composites. Generally, the newer an aircraft is, the 
higher the percentage of composite components it contains. This trend 
will most likely continue. However, composite component electrical 
testing and repair development and implementation is far ahead of FRCSE 
capability and techniques. In order to continue improving the 
reliability of repairs and lower the total cost of ownership, newer 
technologies and expertise have to be transitioned and implemented at 
FRCSE. In addition, many current composite repair processes are labor 
intensive and have significant air emissions and hazardous material 
usage.

Description of Request: I have secured $1,600,000 in funding in H.R. 
2368 in the Operations and Maintenance, Navy account for the Wireless 
Pierside Connection System.

This project is a state-of-the-art secure system which supports 
wireless transmission of both data and voice for shipboard to shore 
communications when a ship is pierside. The WPCS solution has proven to 
be operationally sound, has successfully withstood security penetration 
testing by NIOC and NSA, and has received Type Accreditation by the 
DSAWG in conjunction with NETWARCOM. Further, the WPCS solution has 
passed HERP, HERP and HERO testing providing acceptable levels of 
safety for use both pierside and shipboard.

When U.S. Navy ships return to port the primary voice and data 
communications connection is one or more fiber and/or copper umbilical 
cables. The susceptibility of this dated infrastructure to the harsh 
conditions of the pierside environment and mishandling by Navy and 
support personnel has rendered this solution unreliable and highly 
expensive.

Description of Request: I have secured $1,600,000 in funding in H.R. 
2368 in the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy account 
for 76mm Swarmbuster Capability.

Swarmbuster is a proposed developmental program to integrate the 
highly accurate fire control information from the MK 15 Close-In 
Weapons Systems with the high rate of fire, medium caliber, 76mm gun on 
FFG-7 Class ships.

The Surface Navy lacks an effective capability against High Speed 
Maneuverable Surface Targets (HSMST's). The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) 
was designed with a mission module to combat this threat, but program 
difficulties will delay delivery of this capability for years. 
Successful Swarmbuster test results will provide the Navy the 
opportunity to integrate a layered defense capability into its FFG-7 
class ships, against air and surface threats.
