Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the knowledge of all Senators, there 
will be a briefing here tomorrow, in the Visitor Center in the closed 
hearing room, dealing with Afghanistan. There is going to be a report 
come out from the White House tomorrow. Ambassador Holbrooke will be 
here to brief all Senators. I wish we could have given everyone more 
notice. I didn't know about it until 4 o'clock today. I am sorry about 
that. I know attendance may not be perfect because at 12 noon, there is 
going to be a series of votes in the Budget Committee. There will also 
be a series of votes at 3:30 tomorrow afternoon in the Budget 
Committee. What we accomplish on the floor, we are going to work around 
these votes that come from the Budget Committee. I would hope we could 
wrap up this bill right after that briefing, which will end at 5 
o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
