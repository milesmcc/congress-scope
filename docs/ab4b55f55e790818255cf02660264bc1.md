Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation 
(H.R. 3649) that would require mercenary training be conducted only on 
property owned by the Federal Government.

As you may know, Blackwater USA, a private military security 
contractor, already operates two private military-style training 
facilities: one in Moyock, North Carolina and the other in Mount 
Carroll, Illinois. Blackwater USA is also seeking to open a third 
facility in Potrero, California.

It is outrageous to allow private individuals or corporations to 
establish private military bases anywhere in the United States! The 
military-style training conducted at these facilities has no place in 
our backyards.

The Federal Government and U.S. military have also become too reliant 
on these private security contractors, especially in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. We must stop this trend!

However, in the meantime, my bill will take the modest step of 
requiring government contractors, like Blackwater USA, to train only on 
property owned by the Federal Government, such as our military bases.
