`Mr. McGOVERN â€” 14 November 2007`

---


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me yield myself 30 seconds.

Mr. Speaker, I and everybody in this Chamber, hopefully, wants to see 
democracy flourish in Iraq. But the fact of the matter is that the 
status quo isn't producing that. And maybe, just maybe, the corrupt and 
inept Maliki government will get its act together if it finally 
realizes that we won't be there forever, that this will not be an 
endless war.

Our troops have sacrificed enough. They have sacrificed enough.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2/1/4/ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. Jackson-Lee).

(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise 
and extend her remarks.)
