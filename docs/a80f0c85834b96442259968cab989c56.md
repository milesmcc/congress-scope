Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Madam Chair, I rise this morning 
to state my strong support for the budget resolution.

I'm excited to see that American working families will once again be 
prioritized.

It is a sight for sore eyes to see the President present an honest 
budget, putting an end to years of masking the costs of things we have 
to pay for, like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

This is good news for working and middle-class families who have been 
struggling to keep their heads above water. For far too long, these 
families have been bearing the brunt of misplaced priorities, above 
all, the ever-rising cost of healthcare.

Too many never see a doctor until they visit an emergency room. The 
cost to employers, local, state and the federal government is 
unsustainable.

It is shameful that while the United States spends more than every 
other nation in the world on health care, we fail to care for everyone.

This budget makes a down payment on health care reform, invests in 
working families, and sets America on a fundamentally new course. I 
urge my colleagues to support this critical investment.
