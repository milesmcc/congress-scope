Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today for a simple yet important purpose. I 
rise alongside my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to say that we 
support a 3.5 percent pay increase for the brave men and women of our 
Armed Forces.

Madam Speaker, when I was serving in Baghdad, I fought alongside 
Specialist Juan Arevalo, or ''RV'' to his friends and fellow 
paratroopers. RV is a quick-witted and fearless Texan who had the trust 
of everyone in our brigade and would say things to make us laugh or 
make us think, even during war.

We used to joke that RV signed up for active duty in the Army without 
even knowing that soldiers got paid. The joke was that he was so 
innocent, he thought the only compensation he received was training, 
housing, and three square meals a day. Serving in Iraq and making just 
over $15,000 a year, RV told everybody he was the richest man in Iraq.

Even though RV would have worked for free in our military, he 
shouldn't have to, and neither should the families who depend on their 
loved ones overseas.

More than 1.6 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have 
been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of them multiple times. 
These are the brave men and women whose pay we seek to raise today, a 
pay raise that is long overdue.

Madam Speaker, there are more than 3 million family members who count 
on someone serving on active duty in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Today we fight not just for those soldiers but for their families as 
well.

Our resolution points out that there is currently a 4 percent pay gap 
between members of the Armed Forces and those in civilian life. At a 
time when our Armed Forces are stretched so thin, we need to offer more 
comparable pay to the private sector to retain the most qualified 
service men and women. Our resolution also gives thanks for their 
valiant service to our Nation.

Madam Speaker, this is a commonsense measure. But, unfortunately, our 
President has called this pay increase ''unnecessary.'' And yet 2 weeks 
ago President Bush said, ''America should do what it takes to support 
our troops.'' The President criticizes the spending priorities of this 
Congress but stands in the way of a pay increase for our troops.

I say the President should do what it takes to support our troops. 
This pay raise is long overdue and it is necessary, and President 
Bush's opposition to it is simply unconscionable.

Madam Speaker, with a 3.5 percent pay increase, we aren't talking 
about a lot of money. But for a private in Iraq making less than 
$16,000 a year in basic pay, that small increase would make all the 
difference in the world. For enlisted men with bills to pay and young 
children to support, several hundred dollars a year more is a big deal.

Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
Jones) for his courageous support, Chairman Murtha, Chairman Obey, 
Chairman Snyder, as well as Chairwoman Davis and Chairman Skelton for 
their leadership on this issue.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
