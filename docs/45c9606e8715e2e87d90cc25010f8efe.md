Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, what are we going to do? Are we going to 
let our men and women in the field stop their activities? Is that what 
Congress is urging be done, just sit down, stop what you are doing in 
Iraq and Afghanistan? I don't believe that. That is not the message 
this Senate wants to send or intends to send. But we should not put the 
men and women of our Armed Forces and their families here at home 
through such an ordeal and a period of such unnecessary uncertainty. We 
should not cause the Department of Defense to operate at less than peak 
efficiency or take actions that are demoralizing for Department 
personnel simply because Congress fails to act in a timely manner.

I don't know why it has taken Congress so long to act. I do know the 
request has been before the Congress for more than 15 months. Think 
about it: an emergency supplemental request for funds for national 
security languishing in Congress for 15 months. Most people don't know 
that.

We have held hearings, we have had meetings with administration 
officials, we have heard testimony from General Petraeus, our commander 
in Iraq. Our Ambassador in Iraq has testified about the consequences on 
accounts for the Department of State which are also included in the 
legislation. But instead of marking up a supplemental bill to respond 
to the request a month ago, as had originally been planned, the 
majority chose to spend weeks talking with the majority in the other 
body, trying to decide what to do, when to do it, negotiating with 
themselves.

I would have hoped that the legislation could have been brought up 
under a better parliamentary scheme designed to get the job done, not 
to just create political advantage, not just to put off the inevitable 
day of reckoning. That is an unfortunate choice to make. The fact is, 
had we followed the regular order, we could have had a bill to the 
President by now. Had he chosen to veto the bill, we might well be 
working this week to resolve differences with the administration and 
produce a bill that could be signed or whatever the Congress decided to 
do to work its will, but to act. Instead, we are facing the approach of 
a Memorial Day recess with no clear path, no clear plan to enactment of 
legislation and little prospect for meaningful input by Members of the 
Senate.

I applaud the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my good 
friend from West Virginia, for calling our committee to a markup of the 
supplemental. When it became apparent that the leadership plan was to 
bypass the Appropriations Committee in both Houses, our side wrote a 
letter to the chairman expressing our preference for a committee 
markup. I suspected that was consistent with his views, too, and that 
was correct.

We know about the prerogatives of the Appropriations Committee and 
how the chairman safeguards those and how he respects all members of 
our committee. So he honored that request. But the other body has not 
acted in this way. There still has been no markup in the other body.

So we are in this dilemma. We are asked by our respective Houses--the 
Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense--to make recommendations, to 
produce legislation to take care of our country, to defend our 
interests, but we have not found a pathway to enacting a bill or 
responding in a professional way to the wishes of our Members.

As it stands now, the Senate amendments contain a number of 
legislative provisions and appropriations that were not included in the 
President's request. The President has said very clearly he will veto 
this bill if it includes language that unduly constrains our military 
commanders in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan or which imposes 
artificial timelines for withdrawal. He has also said he will veto a 
bill that is too costly.

I am not one who thinks an appropriations request submitted by this 
President or any other President is written in holy tablets, somehow 
immutable and not subject to improvement or change during the 
legislative process. The Senate and the House have a right to work 
their will. Since the President saw fit to recommend certain measures 
to protect the State of Louisiana from future hurricanes in response to 
Members' requests for those funds, I thought it appropriate to 
recommend certain projects that would similarly be helpful to my State, 
which was also a victim of Katrina, to deal with the continuing 
challenges to the security and the well-being of the citizens of that 
region if other hurricanes strike in the future.

The President has every right to look at those requests and make his 
decision. But I do not think he is going to veto this bill because of 
those requests that are included in the bill. I think he is sympathetic 
to the needs of the Mississippi and Louisiana gulf coasts and elsewhere 
in the country, so accounts that were depleted because of the 
destruction of the hurricane can be renewed and resupplied in this 
supplemental. The committee has approved including those funds.

We need to find common ground. This is what I am saying. We have had 
differences of opinion with the administration--Members on my side 
have; some on the other side have--for various reasons. But let's get 
to a point where we can work out our differences. If he wants to veto 
the bill, he will veto the bill, and we will see whether we have the 
votes to override it. If we do not, we can try again. Eventually these 
funds have to be made available. These requests are too important to be 
ignored any longer. We need to find common ground. That is what I am 
saying. And we need to do it now.

We do not need to prolong this activity--describe it however you want 
to--any longer. We need to get down to brass tacks. We cannot allow 
political maneuvering on either side to obscure our core duty in this 
matter. We need to provide our men and women in the field with the 
resources necessary to conduct successfully the mission assigned to 
them by our Government, and to do it without undue delay.

I do not think the exchange of messages--strategy, or whatever you 
want to call it--is appropriate or necessary as a substitute for 
legislation. I do not think it will result in an enacted bill any 
sooner than had we simply acted in the regular order. But that choice 
has been made, and we must deal with it. I will do my best. I commit 
myself to work with the Senate leadership, with our colleagues in the 
other body, and with the President to find a way to get the job done in 
a timely manner.

I yield the floor.
