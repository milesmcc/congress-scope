# CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR
## `5530a191e4dfd7b5e9d445f03ae64d06`
`Mr. CONRAD â€” 12 March 2008`

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the leaders for the action they 
have taken for a short-term extension of the farm bill so that we can 
conclude action on it. It has been a negotiation that has gone on well 
over a year. That is not unusual for a farm bill which is extremely 
contentious.

I wanted to comment briefly on the Republican leader's statements 
this morning about our budget. As I was driving in this morning, I 
heard another Republican on the air saying that we have a trillion-
dollar tax increase in this budget. I don't know what budget they are 
talking about because it certainly is not the budget we have presented 
here. There is no trillion-dollar tax increase here. There is no tax 
increase assumed here. Honestly, if I would go down to the Senate 
dining room and come to this floor and introduce the dining room menu 
as the budget for the United States, our Republican colleagues would 
say it was a trillion-dollar tax increase.

This is what they said last year, and we hear the same mantra again 
this year: It is a trillion-dollar tax increase. When they said it last 
year, we didn't have a record of a Democratic Congress to refute their 
claim. Now we do. We can look back and see precisely what happened with 
Democrats in control. How much did taxes increase after the Republicans 
asserted repeatedly we were going to increase taxes a trillion dollars? 
What happened? What happened on the record, not a projection, not a 
forecast, not rhetorical, what is the fact? It is very interesting. 
Democrats controlling the House, controlling the Senate, cut taxes $194 
billion--not a tax increase, a tax cut that overwhelmingly has gone to 
the middle class. That is the Democratic record.

Let me say about this budget, we don't have the vast spending 
increases they are talking about. For this year, if you look at total 
spending, we have 1 percent more than the President's budget. Where is 
that money going? We put it into energy, to reduce our dependence on 
foreign oil. We put it into education, and we put it into 
infrastructure because we don't want any more bridges, like the one in 
Minnesota last year, collapsing into the river with people driving home 
from work. That is a fact.

In terms of revenue, the truth is that over the 5 years, we have 2.6 
percent more revenue than in the President's budget. We believe that 
can be obtained not with a tax increase--don't need a tax increase to 
get it--you can go after the tax gap, the difference between what 
companies and people owe versus what they are actually paying. You can 
go after these offshore tax havens which the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations has told us are costing this country $100 billion a 
year. You can go after these abusive tax shelters where we have the 
spectacle of companies in the United States, banks buying foreign sewer 
systems and depreciating them on their books in the United States to 
reduce their tax bill here, and then they lease the sewer systems back 
to the European cities that built them. My goodness. We are better than 
that as a nation, better than letting people abuse the vast majority of 
us who are honest. That is not right. That is not fair.

I have shown on this floor many times a picture of a five-story 
office building in the Cayman Islands called Ugland House. That 5-story 
building is home to 12,800 companies. I would say that is the most 
efficient building in the world.

Mr. President, 12,800 companies claim they are doing business out of 
this little five-story building in the Cayman Islands. They are not 
doing business there. The only business they are doing is monkey 
business. What they are doing is evading their taxes.

Now we have seen, according to the Boston Globe, another building 
down in the Cayman Islands--this time a four- or five-story building 
too--and we know KBR, who is the biggest contractor for security forces 
in Iraq and additional workers in Iraq for the U.S. military effort 
there, is running an operation out of that building to evade the Social 
Security taxes and the Medicare taxes of thousands and thousands of 
workers they have employed for Iraq--another tax scam.

It is exactly the kind of thing we on this side think should be 
closed down. Over and over, when we have tried, this President said: 
No, you can't do that. That would be a tax increase. Really? Is that a 
tax increase? I do not think so. Making people pay their fair share, 
like the vast majority of Americans already do--I do not think that is 
a tax increase. I think that is making those folks pay like all the 
rest of us do. That is fair.

Mr. President, we have Senators on the floor ready to offer an 
amendment. I want to go to that at this moment.

I ask Senator Bingaman, how much time----
