Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise with profound sadness 
to recognize a fallen marine from my district, Lance Corporal Jordan 
Christian Haerter who was only 19 years old when he was killed in Iraq 
last week.



Lance Corporal Haerter was from the small Peconic Bay community of 
Sag Harbor, New York, and is the village's first war casualty since 
World War II. He is the 30th of our brave troops from Long Island, and 
the eighth constituent of mine, who has fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Lance Corporal Haerter had been in Iraq for only a month when he died 
a hero while defending a checkpoint in Ramadi. He was killed while 
firing at the driver of an enemy truck full of explosives that was 
running a barrier and about to crash into dozens of his fellow marines. 
His noble sacrifice was honored earlier this week when hundreds of Long 
Islanders paid their respects outside the Old Whalers Church in Sag 
Harbor. They remembered his youth, his love of the Marine Corps, and 
his determination to be the best marine he could be. He was always 
faithful.

On behalf of New York's First Congressional District, I extend our 
heartfelt condolences to his family. Their loss will never be 
forgotten, and we will always remember Jordan's noble sacrifice.
