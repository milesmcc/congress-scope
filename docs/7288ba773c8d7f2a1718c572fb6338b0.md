`Mr. YOUNG of Alaska â€” 24 January 2007`

---


Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker, I rise to thank my distinguished 
colleague from Maryland, the majority leader, for introducing this 
resolution, but I am forced to oppose it.

The voting rights we are considering today are so limited in scope 
that they are merely symbolic, which has been said. Under the 
gentleman's resolution, the Delegates and Resident Commissioner will 
never be able to cast a vote to determine the final outcome of a vote, 
because if it were to be decisive, there would be an automatic revote 
on which they could not participate. As odd as it may seem, when it 
doesn't count, it counts. And when it counts, it doesn't count, as my 
good friend from California said.

Madam Speaker, this proposal falls far short from what we should be 
doing to address the way our Nation currently deals with its insular 
areas, and that is why I am unable to support this legislation. As 
chairman of the Resources Committee in the mid- to late 1990s, we led 
an effort, we, this side, not that side, led an effort that would have 
specifically addressed the question of political status of the 4 
million American citizens that reside in Puerto Rico. That bill did 
pass this House by one vote, but the Senate failed to act on it.

In the last Congress, my good friend and colleague from Puerto Rico, 
the ranking member of the Insular Affairs Subcommittee, Resident 
Commissioner Luis Fortuno, revived this effort after 5 years of 
inaction. He introduced a bipartisan legislation that was followed with 
the recommendations set forth by the White House Task Force on Puerto 
Rico's Status Report to Congress.

Puerto Rico has been a U.S. territory with an unresolved political 
status since our Nation acquired the island in 1898. Puerto Ricans have 
been citizens and have honorably served in our Nation's Armed Forces 
since 1917. Close to 60 of them have already paid the ultimate 
sacrifice in our Nation's war against terror in Iraq and Afghanistan.

These 4 million U.S. citizens deserve more than just symbolism. They 
deserve a permanent resolution to the question of their political 
status.

Madam Speaker, I say respectfully, it is time we act honorably and 
give them the right to vote as a State.
