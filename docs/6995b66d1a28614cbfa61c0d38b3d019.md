Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2237 with certain 
reservations. Very few bills that pass this House are written exactly 
as each of us would like. My own plan for the redeployment of U.S. 
forces would not take this exact form. However, the general thrust of 
this plan is in the right direction. It establishes a timetable to 
extricate U.S. forces from a bloody, sectarian civil war while 
providing the flexibility to carry out other missions both inside and 
outside Iraq for the purpose of going after al Qaeda and other 
terrorist organizations with global reach. It also provides for U.S. 
forces to train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces, and to protect the 
U.S. Embassy and diplomatic missions.

Mr. Speaker, I preferred the approach taken by the House in the 
Supplemental Appropriations bill we recently passed. Unfortunately, the 
President vetoed that measure. He wants the funds without any 
accountability. We cannot give the President a blank check. While I do 
not agree with every provision in this bill, it sends the right 
message--it is time to end the President's failed policies in Iraq and 
change direction.
