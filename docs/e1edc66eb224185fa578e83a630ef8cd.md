`Mr. REED â€” 17 July 2007`

Mr. REED. Mr. President, President Bush is fond of slogans over 
strategy. We have heard them--''bring them on,'' ''cut and run,'' ''as 
they stand up, we will stand down.'' As my colleague, Senator Snowe, 
and our cosponsors have pointed out, he is fond of placing hopes over 
reality. Well, the reality today is threefold.

First, the precise steps must be taken by Iraq's political leaders, 
and they have not done that. Second, we cannot sustain this level of 
force past next spring because of the limits of our military structure. 
Third, the President has lost the confidence of the American people and 
the public support, and you cannot conduct a strategy without that.

That is not a political comment, that is a strategic tactical 
comment. According to the Field Manual, and I quote:




 At the strategic level gaining and maintaining U.S. public 


 support for a tactical deployment is critical.





We must change our strategy in Iraq. No strategy can be sustained, 
regardless of the slogan, without the necessary troops and strong 
public support, and in this case decisive action by the Iraqi political 
leadership. The longer we delay--the longer we delay--the more public 
support erodes and options to avoid a more chaotic redeployment 
disappear.

To those who urge delay, to wait until September, to wait until next 
spring, I would ask them to ask several questions: First, after 4 years 
of observing the political process in Baghdad, political maneuvering 
without effect, do they believe 6 weeks, until September, 6 months, or 
even 6 years will fundamentally change the sectarian political dynamic 
in Baghdad, the violent struggle between Shia, who feel paranoid, and 
Sunnis, who feel entitled to rule? Even on a tactical level, will 6 
weeks or 6 months or 6 years provide irreversible progress on the 
ground without the political progress necessary?

The Levin-Reed amendment tries to recognize the reality on the ground 
both there and here and to shape our strategy to sustain an effort to 
serve the interest of this country, and we hope the region and the 
world, and I urge passage.

Mr. President, I yield back.
