`Mr. McCAIN â€” 18 December 2010`

---


Mr. McCAIN. So here we are, about 6 weeks after an election that 
repudiated the agenda of the other side, and we are jamming, or trying 
to jam, major issues through the Senate of the United States because 
they know they cannot get it done beginning next January 5. They cannot 
do it next January 5. The American people have spoken, and they are 
acting in direct repudiation of the message of the American people. 
That is why they are jamming this through.

My friends, there is a lot of talk about compromise. There is a lot 
of talk about working together. You think what this ''bizarro'' world 
that the majority leader has been carrying us in, of cloture votes on 
this, votes on various issues that are on the political agenda of the 
other side--to somehow think that beginning next January 5 we will all 
love one another and kumbaya? I do not think so. I do not think so.

Unfortunately, the majority is using the lameduck session to push an 
agenda, when the fact is lameduck sessions are supposed to be to finish 
up the work of Congress so the new Congress can act on the issues of 
the day.

The American people have spoken in what the President of the United 
States described as a ''shellacking.'' Everything we are doing is 
completely ignoring that message. Maybe it will require another 
election.



So, for example, I filed two amendments I believe are relevant to 
this bill, important to this major change. Those will not be in order.

I have always and consistently stated that I would listen to and 
fully consider the advice of our military and our military leadership. 
On December 3, the Committee on Armed Services heard from the Chiefs of 
our four military services--the Chiefs of our four military services.

General Amos said:




 Based on what I know about the very tough fight in 


 Afghanistan, the almost singular focus of our combat forces 


 as they train up and deploy into theater, the necessary 


 tightly woven culture of those combat forces that we are 


 asking so much of at this time, and, finally, the direct 


 feedback from the survey, my recommendation is that we should 


 not implement repeal at this time.


Then he talks about:




 Mistakes and inattention or distractions cost Marines' 


 lives.


Cost marines' lives.




 [M]arines came back--


After serving in combat--



 and they said, ''Look, anything that's going to break or 


 potentially break that focus and cause any kind of 


 distraction may have an effect on cohesion.'' I don't want to 


 permit that opportunity to happen. And I'll tell you why. If 


 you go up to Bethesda . . . Marines are up there with no 


 legs, none. We've got Marines at Walter Reed with no limbs.


General Casey said:




 I believe that the implementation of the repeal of Don't 


 Ask, Don't Tell in the near term will, one, add another level 


 of stress to an already stretched force; two, be more 


 difficult in our combat arms units; and, three, be more 


 difficult for the Army than the report suggests.


General Schwartz basically said the same thing.

I have heard from thousands--thousands--of Active-Duty and retired 
military personnel. I have heard from them, and they are saying: 
Senator McCain, it isn't broke, and don't fix it.

So all of this talk about how it is a civil rights issue and 
equality, the fact is, the military has the highest recruiting and 
highest retention than at any other time in its history. So I 
understand the other side's argument as to their social, political 
agenda. But to somehow allege that it has harmed our military is not 
justified by the facts.

I hope everybody recognizes this debate is not about the broader 
social issues that are being discussed in our society, but what is in 
the best interest of our national security and our military during the 
time of war.

Now, I am aware this vote will probably pass today in a lameduck 
session, and there will be high-fives all over the liberal bastions of 
America. We will see the talk shows tomorrow--a bunch of people talking 
about how great it is. Most of them never have served in the military 
or maybe even not even known someone in the military.

And, you know, we will repeal it; all over America there will be gold 
stars put up in windows in the rural towns and communities all over 
America that do not partake in the elite schools that bar military 
recruiters from campus, that do not partake in the salons of Georgetown 
and the other liberal bastions around the country. But there will be 
additional sacrifice. I hear that from master sergeants. I hear that 
from junior officers. I hear that from leaders.

So I am confident that with this repeal our military--the best in the 
world--will salute and do the best they can to carry out the orders of 
the Commander in Chief. That is the nature--that is the nature--of our 
military, and I could not be more proud of them in the performance that 
they have given us in Iraq and Afghanistan, and before that other 
conflicts. They will do what is asked of them.

But do not think it will not be at great cost. I will never forget 
being, just a few weeks ago, at Kandahar. An Army sergeant major, with 
five tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, in a forward operating base, said: 
Senator McCain, we live together. We sleep together. We eat together. 
Unit cohesion is what makes us succeed.

So I hope when we pass this legislation we will understand we are 
doing great damage, and we could possibly and probably--as the 
Commandant of the Marine Corps said; and I have been told by literally 
thousands of members of the military--harm the battle effectiveness 
which is so vital to the survival of our young men and women in the 
military.

Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.
