Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to the men and 
women of Alabama's Air National Guard.

The men and women of Alabama's Air National Guard are most deserving 
of our commendation. In the hours following the terror attacks of 
September 11th, members of Alabama's Air National Guard mobilized to 
patrol the skies above major southern U.S. cities. For the next year, 
these brave men and women vigilantly maintained a watchful presence in 
the skies.

Shortly after responding to that call of duty, Alabama's Air National 
Guard was again called up to active duty in support of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. Alabama's Air National Guard has taken a leading role in Iraq, 
with units completing up to three tours of duty. This high deployment 
level is a testament to the bravery and professional preparedness of 
the men and women of Alabama's Air National Guard, and confirms that 
Alabama's Air National Guard units are equipped with the necessary 
skills to meet the United States military's mission requirements in 
Iraq. This deployment also marked a significant first for Alabama's Air 
National Guard and the U.S. military; it was the first unit to ever use 
the GBU-38, commonly referred to as the ''Smart Bomb,'' in combat. This 
very effective weapon, which minimizes collateral damage, was 
effectively employed by Alabama's Air National Guard in the Battle of 
Fallujah.

Currently, members of Alabama's Air National Guard are deployed to 
Arizona and New Mexico as part of increased efforts to secure America's 
southern border. The highest levels of the U.S. military leadership 
have recognized and honored the service of Alabama's Air National 
Guard. The Guard has received numerous Flight Safety awards from the 
Air Force Air Combat Command and the Air National Guard for its safety 
record, and it has also been recognized by Air Combat Command and the 
9th Air Force Inspector General for excellence during Operational 
Readiness Inspections and Unit Compliance Inspections over the last two 
decades.

The dedication of the men and women of Alabama's Air National Guard, 
as well as the vision and leadership of the officers in charge, has 
brought honor to the Guard, their fellow Alabamians, and fellow 
Americans. They and their families have sacrificed a great deal.



It is an honor for me to rise today and recognize the brave men and 
women of America's armed forces, and in particular, the brave men and 
women of Alabama's Air National Guard. May their dedication to the 
cause of freedom be an example to their families, friends, neighbors, 
and citizens throughout Alabama and across the United States of 
America.
