Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, just this morning we 
received reports that the al Qaeda leader in Iraq has been killed. 
Despite such signs that support for the terrorist group in Iraq is 
fading, Democrats in Congress continue to advocate retreat and defeat. 
Fortunately for American families and our troops in the battlefield, we 
have a Commander in Chief who understands that victory is essential. As 
the Washington Post has editorialized: ''America's defeat will lead to 
catastrophic civilian deaths, the reestablishment of terrorist training 
camps, and possibly a regional war. We must face the terrorists 
overseas, or we will face them again in the streets of America.''

Our Nation is at war. Our troops are bravely serving their country. 
We have a responsibility to provide for their well-being. I support 
President Bush's pending veto and look forward to passing a clean 
supplemental bill that fully funds our soldiers' mission of protecting 
American families.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
