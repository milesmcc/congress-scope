Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Speaker, I am rising today in support of the Responsible 
Redeployment from Iraq Act. The time has come to stop this senseless 
policy of using our brave men and women in uniform as cops policing a 
religious civil war, and it's time for our country to rededicate 
ourselves to winning the war on terror.

The data is in. The facts are irrefutable in and the conclusion 
clearly demonstrates that the President's continued resolve to engage 
in nation building in Iraq has made America weaker and has put our 
Nation in greater peril from terrorist attack. It is time that we stop 
asking our brave sons and daughters to give the ultimate sacrifice in 
support of the President's failed policies.

It is time for the President to listen to his own advisors and the 
American people. It is time for the President to admit mistakes he has 
made and for him to show leadership by changing direction. It is time 
for the President to


honor our service men and women by rebuilding our military and by using 
our finest fighting force the world has ever known to bring Osama bin 
Laden to justice, to search out and destroy terrorists and to punish 
the nations that support terror.
