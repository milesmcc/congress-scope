`Mr. REID â€” 12 June 2007`

Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have reached another tragic milestone in 
the Iraq war: 3,500 American troops have now been lost. Every one of 
those 3,500 is a hero. But every brave man and woman who continues to 
serve and protect us is a hero as well.

This is a somber time. At a somber time such as this, words betray 
our grief and our gratitude. So I ask my colleagues to join me in a 
moment of silence to honor the memory and sacrifice of every airman, 
soldier, sailor, and marine we have lost in Iraq and Afghanistan.
