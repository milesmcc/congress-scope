Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, as positive progress continues against 
America's enemies in Iraq, the vocal, timid and meek here at home 
promote a strategy of defeat and retreat. Victory to these retreatists 
is not an option because they plan for abandonment of the Iraqi people 
and failure for America's fight against those who murder in the name of 
religion.

These war alarmists wish to capitulate in this war. They want to 
redeploy the troops, which means withdraw our military while they are 
in the midst of success. This strategy of defeat will not bring peace 
to Iraq or America. It will not stop the extremists, but increase their 
determination for more violence against the innocents. It will not make 
us safe at home, but encourage those who hate us to kill again. And 
those vile zealots will rightfully claim America doesn't have the 
stomach to fight for the God-given principles of liberty.

President Kennedy told the world that America will pay any price, 
support any friend and oppose any foe to defend liberty. We do not 
fight for ourselves alone. This war is more than for our cause alone. 
We fight for the human cause of all peoples to be free. That is what 
this war is about.

And that's just the way it is.
