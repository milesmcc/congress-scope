Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the gentleman.

I would like to now yield time to my good friend Judge Carter from 
Texas. He is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Foreign 
Operations Subcommittee. He knows a little bit about what is going on 
in Iraq. He has been there. I would love to hear what he has to say.
