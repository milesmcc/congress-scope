# IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
## `b41f879c9e49ebfbf65ed0dd1fb4efea`
`Mr. SMITH of Washington â€” 15 February 2007`

Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I would just argue, first of 
all, I respect the gentleman from Texas, but I have only been here for 
an hour and 15 minutes and I have heard countless alternatives from 
many Democratic speakers. May not like those alternatives, may not 
think they are the best course, but it is wrong to say that the 
Democrats have not offered alternative courses of action in Iraq. They 
have offered a good many.

Madam Speaker, I yield 5/1/2/ minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. Kaptur).
