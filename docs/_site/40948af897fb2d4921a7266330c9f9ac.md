Ms. NORTON. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding.

I thank the gentleman from Georgia for leading this debate. Truly, 
you are the man to lead this debate on this great civil rights bill 
that the House is about to give after 206 years. I thank you for coming 
forward to do so.

I want to praise and offer my gratitude to Democratic leaders for 
reconciling the important principle of fiscal responsibility, PAYGO as 
we call it, with the basic principle of voting rights, forsaking 
neither. H.R. 1906 is particularly appropriate, especially when you 
consider that D.C. residents have always paid taxes, notwithstanding 
that the 16th amendment says that only States shall pay taxes.

Mayor Adrian Fenty and Council Chair Vincent Gray yesterday led a 
march in the wind and the rain on Emancipation Day because 145 years 
ago Lincoln freed the slaves in the District of Columbia 9 months ahead 
of the slaves elsewhere. My grandfather, Richard Holmes, was one of 
those slaves. His son, Richard, entered the D.C. Fire Department in 
1902. And his son, Coleman, my father, like his forefathers and like 
me, have never had a vote in this city.

I am particularly grateful, and I wanted this time especially to 
thank the 22 Republicans who voted for the bill today, preserving the 
great tradition of the party of Lincoln for equal rights.

The Constitution was written by men who risked everything for the 
principle of representation. We should be especially mindful today, 
perhaps, to dedicate this bill to other men who have risked everything 
in times of war. 80-year-old retired Wesley Brown, the first black 
graduate of the Naval Academy and a resident of the District of 
Columbia, who went to the same high school that I attended, served in 
three wars, and retired from the Navy as lieutenant commander, but 
never has had the right to vote. His remarkable life story is 
chronicled in the book ''Breaking the Color Barrier: The U.S. Naval 
Academy's First Black Midshipman and the Struggle for Racial 
Equality.''

Bringing the matter forward, some young men in the District of 
Columbia are returning from Iraq, and I leave you with a few of their 
words. I quote Marcus Gray, who spent a year in Iraq in the 299th 
Engineering Company, who said, ''My father served in the 104th Airborne 
in Vietnam, and I am proud to follow him by serving my country in the 
same manner. I could be called again this year, but being called to 
active duty is what every soldier in the Reserves should expect to 
happen.

''We also expect equal treatment, and the Army tries hard to see that 
all soldiers are treated equally. However, I want equal treatment at 
home as well. I want the same voting representation as other soldiers, 
and as the Iraqi people have now because of our service.''

Emory Kosh, who works in my office in the House: ''I was proud to 
serve my country as a volunteer soldier. However, I am not prepared to 
sit as an employee of the House of Representatives while every Member 
answers the bell except my Congresswoman.''

Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to give D.C. residents on the 
battlefield and in the city itself the vote they have earned over and 
over again. Most of those who have paid the dearest price will never 
see the benefit. Those in the Vietnam War, the District had more 
casualties than 10 States; in the Korean War, more casualties than 
eight States; in World War II, more casualties than four States; and in 
World War I, more casualties than three States.

In their name, and in good conscience, I ask that the House today 
finally give the residents of the District of Columbia the vote they 
have fought for now for 206 years.
