Mr. SHUSTER. And the gentleman, the point he just made is they try to 
compare Iraq to Vietnam, and it is not a good comparison at all. But, 
when the United States Congress is going to make an attempt to 
micromanage a war, that is going to be a comparison to Vietnam, and the 
same outcome is going to be not a good outcome. And like you said, the 
disaster that occurred, what happens after we leave and there is a 
disaster, human disaster of people, mass exodus from the country? So I 
just wanted to make that point.
