Mr. LEVIN. Some are the same, some are different, but they are 
political benchmarks which the Iraqi leaders said they would meet. They 
made those benchmarks. We didn't impose them, those are their 
benchmarks. The letter from Secretary Rice makes it explicit that the 
Presidency Council, which represents all the factions in Iraq, formally 
adopted those benchmarks. They were supposed to have been adopted in 
October, November, December, January, and in February. They have not 
been met.

How are we going to get them to meet them, to keep an open-ended 
commitment, which is what the President wants us to do. Another delay 
and then patience. The President asks us to be patient? We should be 
downright impatient with the Iraqi leaders. The message to the Iraqi 
leaders shouldn't be, for heaven sakes, after all these casualties, 
that we are going to be patient with them when it is in their hands as 
to whether this civil strife is going to end.
