`Mr. HILL â€” 17 June 2008`

Mr. HILL. I thank my friend, Congressman Boyd from Florida, for being 
a leader of the Blue Dogs on this particular issue.

Mr. Speaker, I remember when I got elected back in 1998 that PAYGO 
rules were in place, and there was the strong possibility that if we 
kept those rules in place that we would actually produce surpluses for 
the first time in, I think, probably 40 years. Well, that dream did 
come true. PAYGO rules were in place in 1998 when I got elected, and 
they were in place in 1999 and in the year 2000. Those rules that were 
in place caused this place to come up with surpluses for the first time 
in 40 years.

I can remember at the time how elated I was because, as a Blue Dog 
who believes in pay-as-you-go rules, the predictions that we were all 
making in our campaigns were actually coming true. That was, if you 
have PAYGO, it is the one discipline that Congress can practice that 
will actually produce balanced budgets and surpluses, and that's 
exactly what happened in the year 2000. I can remember at the time that 
I was thinking, now, finally, we've got a handle on the deficit, that 
we're actually producing surpluses, surpluses to the tune from a lot of 
economists of $1 trillion over 10 years, that we could actually start 
doing the things that have to be done to correct some problems that we 
have with Social Security, with paying down the debt, with maybe 
reducing some taxes. That's the position the Blue Dogs took when those 
surpluses materialized. We advocated paying down the debt, fixing 
Social Security and cutting taxes.

Then we had an election, and Mr. Bush became President of the United 
States, and the Republicans grew their majorities. They had a different 
way of looking at things, and that's okay. That's what elections are 
all about. In that particular year, the Republicans won, and they 
wanted to change the policies.

One of the policies they changed was in dropping the principle of 
PAYGO. I can remember, at the time they dropped the principle of PAYGO, 
that people like Allen Boyd and Baron Hill and other Blue Dogs were 
warning that, if you dropped this discipline, there would be a good 
chance that these surpluses that we had then would disappear. Well, 
that's exactly what happened.

In the year 2000-2002, there was an approximately $6 trillion 
deficit, which was bad enough, but with the surpluses that we knew were 
going to be created we thought we were going to be able to fix that. 
Now that those policies were changed, we predicted that the deficit 
would grow. Sure enough, it has. It is now $9 trillion in debt. So it 
took us well over 200 years to go $6 trillion in debt, and because we 
dropped those PAYGO rules, in 8 short years, we've added another $3 
trillion to the national deficit.

As Congressman Moore said earlier this evening, we are paying huge 
amounts of interest on that deficit, and it is growing, and it is 
spiraling out of control. We have got to get a handle on it.

Now, there was an article in the U.S. News and World Report recently 
that talked about the Blue Dogs' advocating these PAYGO rules. Let me 
read you a bit of what it said. So this is just not the Blue Dogs who 
are pontificating here tonight and who are bragging on the policies 
that created surpluses in the year 2000.

''The Blue Dog Democrats are colorfully named, but they're dead 
serious about their mission of attacking the record $9.4 trillion 
national debt . . . The group's top dog, Representative Allen Boyd,'' 
who is leading this discussion tonight, ''a 63-year-old cattle farmer 
from Florida's panhandle, thinks Americans have been lulled into 
believing that any new program or tax cut will fly, 'and if there's a 
gap, we just go overseas and borrow the money.' We go to the piggy bank 
in the People's Republic of China until it goes empty or until they cut 
it off.''

What is this talk about China that we're talking about here tonight?

Well, because the American government can not pay its debts, it has 
to borrow money. One of the countries that we're borrowing money from 
is the People's Republic of China. I think most people, when they hear 
that, are appalled that we're actually borrowing money from China to 
pay for our debts that we have here in the United States.

Now, what does this mean in translation in terms of how this affects 
the real lives of most Americans? Here is what it does.

These PAYGO rules are tough for Congress. They're tough for Members 
like myself and Congressman Boyd because we've got to make the tough 
decisions about how we're going to pay for programs that we think the 
American people deserve, and we've got a tough vote coming up here in 
the very near future on the GI Bill.

We all believe as Blue Dogs that our veterans who are coming home 
from Iraq and Afghanistan deserve additional education benefits through 
the GI Bill, and the Blue Dogs want to vote for this bill, but we've 
got to pay for it because it's going to cost approximately $60 billion.

I would think that any veteran who is listening out there on C-SPAN 
all across this Nation, that most of the American people and that most 
people in this Congress would believe that we should not be borrowing 
money from the Chinese to pay for the GI Bill. I think most veterans 
would agree to that, but that's what I mean when I say it's tough to 
have these PAYGO rules. We have to make the tough decisions about how 
to balance the needs of the American people in terms of veterans' 
programs and also how to balance the needs of the American people 
because, I think, most veterans would not want us to borrow this money 
from the Chinese in order for their children and grandchildren to pay 
for that veterans' program.

So that is the reality of PAYGO rules. It disciplines Congress. Quite 
frankly, the Blue Dogs are the only ones in Congress right now who are 
insisting that these rules remain in place so that we can discipline 
the Members of Congress in doing the right thing.

I throw that out there about the veterans' programs. These are the 
tough decisions that we have to make. Congressman Boyd and myself and 
every Blue Dog in this Chamber want to make sure that we extend those 
benefits to our veterans who deserve them,


but we're going to insist that it be paid for because, I think, our 
veterans would demand that, and I think the American people would 
demand that.
