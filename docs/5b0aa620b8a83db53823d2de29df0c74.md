Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, just in closing, the 
gentlewoman has been very good, and I appreciate the work of Mrs. Lowey 
on a lot of the issues. As Mr. Shays said, there are a lot of good 
things in the bill.

This, in closing, deals with the whole issue of demining, human 
rights training, criminal justice, rule of law and human rights. None 
of these things really ought to be controversial for anybody, whatever 
their position. Also they fit into the recommendations of the Iraq 
Study Group.

I think to offer an opportunity to heal and to build the private 
sector, the civilian sector in Iraq on these issues of human rights 
training is important, so when the United States is out, there will be 
respect for human rights, there will be criminal justice, there will be 
rule of law.

Mr. Chairman, I urge an ''aye'' vote.
