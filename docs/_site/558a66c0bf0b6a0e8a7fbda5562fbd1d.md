Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I must pay 
tribute to Senator Byrd. We are on different sides of the discussion on 
the Iraq war, but he is an extraordinary public servant who remains as 
full of not just passion, which is evident, but brainpower at a mature 
age, shall I say, as he was when he was a lot younger. It is a 
privilege to serve with him and to have listened to him.
