Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 2956.

I just returned from Iraq. The trip was only a snapshot of what was 
happening on the ground, but I heard two messages: One, we need more 
time to train Iraqi troops and leadership; but two, progress is not 
evident. We are taking two steps back for every step forward. Our men 
and women are serving heroically, but it is clear our progress is 
limited, at best. So where do we go from here?

Mr. Speaker, we need a plan that moves beyond the surge to a time 
frame that says we will continue to support Iraqis in a limited 
capacity but that we will redeploy the bulk of our forces within a 
prescribed period of time.

We are all concerned about the impact our redeployment could have on 
our adversaries, and the region as a whole. However, the reality on the 
ground is that, whether it's in 6 months or 2 years, the size of our 
current force cannot be sustained. The true focus must be on how we 
disengage, how we and our allies work together to support our aims for 
a free and open society in Iraq.

Our choices are bad, awful and worse. But this legislation, I 
believe, will move us a step closer to a day when Iraq's leaders and 
politicians can take back control of their country and our men and 
women can return home to their families and a grateful Nation.
