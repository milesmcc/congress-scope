Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the troop surge 
in Iraq. I believe the motives of President Bush and other prominent 
leaders, such as Senator John McCain, who are pushing for more troops, 
are pure and well meaning. I believe they sincerely think this is the 
best way forward. Three years ago, I would have agreed with them. 
However, at this late stage, interjecting more young American troops 
into the crossfire of an Iraqi civil war is simply not the right 
approach. We are not going to solve an Iraqi political problem with an 
American military solution.

Regardless of how one feels about the war in Iraq or the proposed 
surge in troops, as long as our American troops are in harm's way, it 
is our duty and responsibility to support these troops one hundred 
percent.

May God bless our troops and our country.
