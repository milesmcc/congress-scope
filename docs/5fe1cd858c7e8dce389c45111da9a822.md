Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment is a sense 
of the Senate introduced by Senator Kyl and me. The findings document 
the evidence that shows that Iran, working through its Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps, has been training and equipping Iraqi 
extremists who are killing American soldiers--hundreds of them.

This sense of the Senate calls on the administration to designate the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, allowing 
us to exert economic pressure on those terrorists who also do business 
and to stop them from killing Americans.

Because some of our colleagues thought paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 
sense of the Senate may have opened the door to some kind of military 
action against Iran, Senator Kyl and I have struck them from the 
amendment. That is not our intention. In fact, our intention is to 
increase the economic pressure on Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps so that we will never have to consider the use of the 
military to stop them from what they are doing to kill our soldiers.
