Mr. HINCHEY. Mr. Chairman, we all realize that it is the 
responsibility of every Congress to ensure that the current 
administration adheres to the Constitution and the rule of law.

Most of us understand how this administration used the policy office 
within the Pentagon to falsify intelligence and to provide the Congress 
with false information in an attempt to justify the illegal invasion of 
Iraq and the subsequent disastrous military occupation which has been 
going on there now for more than 4 years.

This amendment makes perfect sense. It simply ensures that kind of 
behavior by this administration is not extended now into another 
country in the Middle East, Iran, based upon the same falsification of 
information and failure to adhere to its obligations under the 
Constitution.

This amendment must be passed. It makes perfect sense, and it ensures 
the security of our country and makes sure that our military personnel 
are not exposed to the kinds of danger that they have been exposed to 
as a result of the falsification of intelligence by this 
administration. Let's pass this amendment.
