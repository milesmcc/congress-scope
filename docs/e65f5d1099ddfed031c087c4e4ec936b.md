# MARINES NOT WELCOME HERE

Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, Oakland Airport officials might as well put a 
sign: ''Welcome to Oakland, but no U.S. military allowed here.''

It seems that over 200 marines from the combat fields of Iraq flew 
into Oakland, California, and were not allowed to deplane into the 
airport. They were forced off the plane between two runways and had to 
sit in the grass for 3 hours while waiting to fly to Hawaii. The troops 
had flown from Iraq via Kuwait, Germany, and JFK Airport. They had 
already been completely screened by Customs and TSA at JFK, but the 
officials at Oakland Airport wouldn't let them into the terminal.

One marine said no explanation was ever given. Interestingly enough, 
reports say this not the first time Oakland banned the U.S. military 
from its airport.

Most airports welcome our returning troops with patriotism, cheers, 
flags and enthusiastic applause. But not in Oakland. They should be 
ashamed. They should apologize to each marine, and Congress needs to 
find out why the marines were treated so poorly and even consider 
prohibiting Federal funds from going to this airport if it is shown 
that the airport is antimilitary.

And that's just the way it is.
