Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday's Washington 
Post editorial was correct when they stated that President Obama's 
goals in Afghanistan, as he outlined in March, were essential to 
preventing another attack on the United States by al Qaeda and its 
extremist allies. Indeed, there is much at stake in Afghanistan in 
establishing security and stability throughout the region. President 
Obama's original strategy is vital to ensuring that terrorist 
organizations do not reestablish safe havens or return the Taliban to 
power.

Our military commanders and troops on the ground are doing 
extraordinary work. We need to ensure they have the resources to 
complete their mission: to defeat the terrorists and to help provide, 
as President Obama mentioned in March, stability in the region.

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
