Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Chairman, I have the honor of serving as the 
Chairman of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.

This bill is about balancing the capabilities and readiness of our 
current military forces with future required military capabilities.

Our military personnel are at risk each and every day. Our first 
priority is to make sure our men and women in uniform are properly 
supported by ensuring our acquisition programs adequately support 
current military requirements.

We cannot shortchange the current force for promised future 
capabilities when we are losing people everyday in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

The Air and Land Forces subcommittee's jurisdiction in this bill 
includes approximately $100 billion in Army and Air Force programs.

Our priorities do not always agree with those of the Pentagon, but 
our objective is clear--to do our very best to ensure our military 
personnel get the best available equipment as soon as it can be 
properly tested--armored vehicles; body and vehicle armor; improvised 
explosive device jammers, unmanned aerial vehicles, small arms, night 
vision equipment, and related equipment.

The bill addresses a number of key requirements:

H.R. 1585 provides $4.1 billion in additional funds to fully fund a 
tactical vehicle referred to as M-RAP, or Mine Resistant Ambush 
Protected vehicle, to better protect our personnel against mines and 
improvised explosive devices. The budget request included less than 
$500 million to meet this $4.6 billion requirement which, as of last 
week, is now Secretary Gates' number one priority.

Over a billion dollars is provided for Stryker combat vehicles.

The bill fully funds body armor, Up-Armored Humvees, Armored Security 
vehicles, and vehicle add armor kits at $5.4 billion.

The bill also provides $4.5 billion for programs established to 
counter improvised explosive devices.

An additional billion dollars is provided for funding of National 
Guard and Reserve Equipment.

Overall, the bill represents an increase of 40 percent for Army 
procurement accounts over last year's budget request.

Ten C-17 strategic airlift aircraft have been added to the bill at a 
cost of over $2.4 billion, to maintain the C-17 production line and 
sustain the strategic airlift fleet.

The Joint Strike Fighter competitive engine program has been funded 
at $480 million to provide two producers of engines for that program.

We have had to make some difficult choices to fund the highest 
priority programs and stay within the budget top-line. Some programs 
will have to make adjustments. We understand that, and will work 
together as the process evolves to ensure that these adjustments can be 
accommodated as best as possible. In closing, I again want to thank my 
distinguished chairman and ranking members of the full committee and 
our subcommittee.

This bill is deserving of a ''yes'' vote from every Member of this 
body.
