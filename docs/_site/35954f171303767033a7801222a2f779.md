`Mr. ROSS â€” 2 October 2007`

Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for those thoughts, 
and he is absolutely correct. We must keep all the soldiers who have 
died in service to our country, those who have been injured in service 
to our country in our hearts and in our prayers. And on this evening I 
hope we'll especially remember Sergeant James Doster from Jefferson 
County, Arkansas, the latest casualty from Arkansas' Fourth 
Congressional District.

The gentleman from Tennessee mentioned those who've died in service 
to our country, and we've talked a little bit about the Iraq war. And I 
want to deviate for a moment and let you know, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. 
Davis and I are part of a group outside of the Blue Dog Coalition, but 
a group of Democrats and Republicans that have come together, 14 
Democrats, 14 Republicans that have created this bipartisan compact on 
Iraq debate because the fact is, Mr. Speaker, I voted three times to 
bring our troops home in a responsible and in a manner that would be 
responsible. But the reality is this: That the reason I voted three 
times is because we don't have a veto-proof majority in the House of 
Representatives. And we can continue to have those votes, but the 
reality is the President will veto those actions and so we really, at 
the end of the day, haven't been successful in a new direction in Iraq.

Finally, you know, if there's one issue that shouldn't be a Democrat 
or Republican issue but should put us all in the context of being 
Americans first, it should be how we move forward on this Iraq debate. 
And there are 28 of us, 14 Democrats, 14 Republicans that have come 
together to create this bipartisan compact on Iraq debate. And I 
welcome, as I go through these points, I would welcome the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. Davis), any comments or thoughts he might want to 
interject. But basically, here's the compact.

We agree, 14 Democrats, 14 Republicans, we agree that the U.S. 
Congress must end the political infighting over the conflict in Iraq 
and commit immediately to a truly bipartisan dialogue on the issues we 
are facing.

I would yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.
