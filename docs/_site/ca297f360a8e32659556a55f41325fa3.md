Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, we have a situation today where 
Americans are paying almost $4 a gallon for gasoline. This morning, 
Goldman Sachs announced that oil is going to go up to $150 to $200 a 
barrel, which means that it is not going to stop at $4. It will be 
about $5 or $6.

Now, think about this: This is a tremendous boom to Iran and Iraq. 
Iran will gain enormous wealth and political influence. Iraq will get 
even more revenue than the $72 billion they're anticipating this year. 
They got $100 billion over the last couple of years, much of it our 
money.

And yet Americans have already contributed over half a trillion 
dollars to Iraq's economy. Within the next couple of weeks, we'll 
appropriate another $170 billion. Iraqis are getting a surplus of oil 
revenue from us and yet we are paying to pick up their garbage and 
train their security forces when they've got surpluses they don't even 
know what to do with.

Who's the chump in this picture, Madam Speaker?
