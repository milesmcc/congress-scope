`Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut â€” 27 February 2007`

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. If the gentlelady would yield for a 
moment, let us also think about what this message is to those that 
would sign up for this volunteer military force being sent to defend 
our country overseas. Not only is this unconscionable to those who have 
sacrificed everything to fight for this country in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, but think about those who we are asking to join the Armed Forces. 
We don't have a draft any more, and many people are thankful for that. 
We rely on the decisions by courageous men and women across this 
country to join voluntarily our Armed Forces.

So when they see people coming back from these wars, being treated 
without the basic dignity that any of us would expect those men and 
women to be treated with, I would think, I hope it doesn't, but I would 
think it might give pause to those that would join our military.

So I think of this from a point of conscience deep inside me, and I 
also think about it from a standpoint of national security. What kind 
of signal are we sending to those who are going to be the next 
generation of troops when this is how we treat them when they come 
back.
