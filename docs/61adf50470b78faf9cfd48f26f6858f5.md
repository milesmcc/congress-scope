Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity about a month ago to 
visit Iraq. When I did, I traveled on a C-130 with troops into Baghdad 
and drove in a Humvee through the city with our troops.

While there, I made the decision that I would do everything I could 
to support the troops. The troops are giving all they can; and because 
of that, whichever side of the aisle you sit on, you need to support 
the troops and support the veterans funding bill that's coming before 
this House, in whatever manner it comes, because the troops come first.

This veterans bill gives veterans the increases in medical care, in 
benefits for veterans and increases in their pay and increases for the 
soldiers' salaries that they need. This veterans bill is important.

When we were in Qatar, the general there, General North, said, Do one 
thing when you go home, don't forget the troops, don't forget the 
veterans who have been injured, and fund them and fund their veterans 
bill.

No matter how it is presented, we should support the veterans and 
vote for the bill.
