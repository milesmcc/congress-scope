`Mr. DAVIS of Tennessee â€” 31 July 2009`

Mr. DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, it's an honor to thank my 
friend and pastor, Dr. Ivan Raley of First Baptist Church in Byrdstown, 
for joining us here today. Pastor Raley has served our church at home 
since 2002, and is retired after 10 years of service as regional vice 
president of the Tennessee Baptist Children's Homes in Brentwood, 
Tennessee.

While serving as pastor, Dr. Raley has traveled on mission trips to 
Venezuela, Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, and in September of 2001, he 
went to New York to serve as a chaplain with the police and firemen 
involved in the 9/11 World Trade Center attack. He also served with the 
International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention in 
Rwanda during the wars there in 1994.

I want to thank Ivan for being here today and for serving our church 
family for the past 7 years. I have looked to him for ministry as we 
continue our work in Congress to build a stronger America for our 
children and our grandchildren. Through the war in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and now in the midst of a difficult economy, I appreciate 
Pastor Raley being there to join me in search of guidance and wisdom.

On behalf of my colleagues, I welcome Dr. Raley, and again, I thank 
him for delivering our invocation here this morning.
