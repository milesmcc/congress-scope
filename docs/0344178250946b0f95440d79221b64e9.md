Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is my understanding in my 
conversations with the chairman, we are moving forward in narrowing 
down amendments so we have an additional managers' package so we have a 
manageable number of amendments that need to be debated and voted on, 
and we will try to get time agreements on those, as well as the Iraqi 
amendments.
