Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, It is going to be very difficult for me to 
vote for a health care bill that contains the Stupak amendment on 
abortion.

Far from codifying the Hyde language, which has been included in 
House appropriations bills since 1976, the Stupak amendment would 
essentially make it impossible for most women to use their own funds to 
purchase insurance to pay for abortions. This is not chipping away at a 
woman's right to choose, this is an outright assault on my 
constitutional rights--and it is wrong.

I respect the right of any woman or man to oppose abortion. But, in 
return, I expect those who are anti-choice to respect my views. My 
views are that abortion should be safe and rare--but that a woman's 
constitutional right to privacy as articulated in Roe v. Wade is 
inviolable.

I am old enough to remember the days of back alley abortions. Some 
women I know had them. I cannot bear the idea that the 111th Congress 
would restore that horror.

The Stupak amendment is insulting and destructive. Its passage would 
pair us with the government of Afghanistan in sending women's rights 
back to the Stone Age. I intend to vote for this bill, but if it 
contains the Stupak amendment when it emerges from Conference 
Committee, my conscience demands that I reconsider my support.
