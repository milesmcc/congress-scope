Mr. PIERLUISI. I yield myself 1 additional minute.

As I was saying, during a late night patrol behind enemy lines, 
soldiers from Puerto Rico, Utah, Georgia watch each others' backs. Any 
differences in culture or language mean nothing. I went to Afghanistan 
recently to visit our troops in Afghanistan. I know what we're talking 
about. What matters is that the flag on their uniform is the same.


As I have said many times before, I support statehood because I 
believe the people of Puerto Rico have earned that right, should they 
choose to exercise it, to become full and equal citizens of the United 
States. But this is not a statehood bill. And that's why, with all due 
respect to the gentleman from Washington State, we will cross that 
bridge when we get to it.

The time and the day that Puerto Rico, the majority of the people 
request for statehood, you will have ample time to debate it, to deal 
with it, to impose a transitional period, whatever this Congress or a 
future Congress might want to do.

I was elected to represent all of the people of Puerto Rico, 
including those whose vision for the island's future differs from my 
own.
