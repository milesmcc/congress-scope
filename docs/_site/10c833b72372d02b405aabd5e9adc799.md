Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Georgia.

I rise in support of the resolution and to pay tribute to my friend 
and fellow member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Dr. Charlie 
Norwood.

Charlie came to Congress after my first term as part of the class of 
1994, and it seems a year did not go by that we did not serve on a 
committee together.

I honorably served with him at first on the Education and Workforce 
Committee and then later on the Energy and Commerce Committee.

Charlie and I shared a passion for health care issues, and I 
particularly enjoyed our work together on the Health Subcommittee.

A dentist by training, Charlie was devoted to improving the health 
care system, not only for providers like himself but also for the 
patients that rely on our health care system to keep them well.

The phrase Patients' Bill of Rights would not have been coined if 
Charlie and our chairman, John Dingell, had not teamed up to give 
patients an ability to fight back against the HMOs that too often make 
health care decisions based on the bottom line, rather than a 
physician's recommendation.

I note Charlie's last legislative act before leaving Washington and 
returning to Georgia was to reintroduce the Patients' Bill of Rights in 
this Congress as H.R. 979.

There is no doubt in my mind that this legislation will be Charlie's 
legacy and will honor him and his work in this esteemed Chamber by 
finally making his vision of patients' rights a reality.

Last July 4 recess, Charlie and I joined two other members of the 
Health Subcommittee as we visited the impressive trauma facilities 
utilized by our brave military doctors to treat our wounded service 
personnel in Balad and Baghdad, Iraq and Kabul, Afghanistan.

I knew there was a good reason Charlie and I got along, despite being 
different parties, but I also realized that


trip that Charlie and I shared a lot of interests, and one of them in 
firearms. I met few people with more enthusiasm for firearms than 
Charlie Norwood.

In fact, I will mention that how he cared about people, and Chairman 
Deal understands that, he presented a book to those of us who went. It 
has a picture of Charlie Norwood with a .50-caliber machine gun in a 
helicopter we were flying in, but Charlie was not really happy because 
he was not sitting behind that .50-caliber machine gun.

Charlie was a good doctor and honorable Member of Congress and a 
great friend. He always thought of others, and I will always remember 
him for his friendship for these years. Our thoughts are with his 
family, and his wife Gloria has become a good friend of my wife Helen 
through the Congressional Spouses, and I will miss Charlie, and we all 
will. We honor his memory and his contributions to our country.
