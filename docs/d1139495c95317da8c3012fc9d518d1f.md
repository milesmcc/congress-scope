Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.

I would just offer to my colleague who just spoke and my other 
colleagues that there are the strongest statements for invasion of Iraq 
that took place before President Bush came into office, and those were 
the now famous speeches that were made by three Senators by the name of 
Kerry, Clinton, and Gore.

Mr. Chairman, the War Powers Act clearly calls for the ability of the 
Commander in Chief to introduce American military force where an 
emergency with respect to a nation has been declared. That emergency 
with respect to Iran has been declared by every American President 
since President Carter in 1979. This is not extra-constitutional. The 
law as it presently exists is consistent with the Constitution. This 
would infringe. In fact, this would roll back the War Powers Act. Every 
Member should vote against this amendment.
