Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
join my colleagues in addressing the House and the American people 
regarding U.S. trade policy and its effect on working families.

Let me start by saying, first of all, that I am committed to trade. 
That's right, I think that trade is good for America and its working 
families. If we do it the right way, trade can increase the 
availability of raw materials for production. Trade can also open 
markets for American goods and can bring exciting new products to 
American consumers. While I recognize the benefits of trade, not all 
trade agreements are created equal.

On May 10, the administration and Members of this House announced a 
''new policy on trade.'' Well, it's about time. Democrats have been 
calling for a new direction in trade for years, and I am pleased that 
the administration has finally taken initial steps to improve its trade 
policy.

But, alas, it is too little, too late. This new trade policy is 
little more than a rehash of the same failed NAFTA model that has been 
hurting U.S. families for more than a decade. According to the 
administration, the new additions to the Peru and Panama agreements 
would add long-sought labor and environmental protections to the basic 
NAFTA framework.

Unfortunately, even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says that these new 
worker and environmental protections can't be enforced. That's not very 
encouraging, is it? Supporting this new deal requires us to believe in 
two things: number one, the actual benefits of the NAFTA free trade 
model; and, number 2, the promises of the Bush administration.

We are supposed to trust an administration that has demonstrated its 
commitment to anything but the truth. Having misled us on issues like 
domestic wire-tapping programs, the war in Iraq, global warming, and 
the firing of U.S. attorneys, it now seeks our trust. How are we 
supposed to trust a record like that?

We have also learned some very hard lessons after more than 10 years 
of free trade failures. As we hear more familiar promise about the new 
trade deal, let's look at some of the old ones. NAFTA was supposed to 
solve illegal integration by developing a robust economy in Mexico that 
would allow hard-working people to provide for their families and stay 
at home. Well, that didn't work.

CAFTA was supposed to include bold new safety and wage protections 
for workers, but these protections are disappointingly weak, allowing 
countries to downgrade their very own labor laws.

In the Oman Free Trade Agreement, the administration actually 
negotiated a deal with a opportunity that, as our own State Department 
reported, was experiencing a forced labor problem--forced labor. How 
are our workers supposed to compete with people who are forced to toil?

Free trade was supposed to increase economic opportunity for 
everybody, for big businesses, as well as working families at home and 
abroad. But it simply hasn't happened.

Too many communities have been left to rot because corporations shut 
down U.S. plants to chase increasingly cheap labor and weak 
environmental protections abroad. After decades of living with NAFTA 
and its clones, real wages for American families are down. Our trade 
deficit is in the tens of billions of dollars, and our manufacturing 
base is falling apart.

The American worker is now more productive than ever, but that 
increased productivity has not led to a corresponding increase in 
wages. The truth is that the NAFTA free trade model is designed to 
favor the wealthiest few and corporate bottom lines at the expense of 
small businesses, workers, families and communities.

In the coming weeks, we will be asked to consider first two of the 
Bush administration's trade priorities, free trade agreements with Peru 
and Panama. Despite the long record of failed free trade agreements, 
the Bush administration and free traders are going to tell us that Peru 
and Panama agreements are less controversial than the administration's 
other priorities, free trade agreements with Colombia and Korea, and 
the renewal of the President's fast-track negotiating authority.

This is a sign of how bad Peru and Panama trade deals are. Their only 
redeeming value, it seems, is that they are not as bad as the deals 
with Korea and Colombia. But that argument misses the point. Every bad 
trade agreement passed, makes it easier for another bad trade agreement 
to slip by.

When they say ''not that bad,'' we should say ''not good enough.'' 
Let's keep our eyes on the ball.

The Peru and Panama free-trade agreements are slippery slopes to 
other bad deals. Passing these deals makes it easier for the Bush 
administration to push through the Korea free-trade agreement which 
would gut the American car industry.



It would make it easier for the White House to push through fast 
track authority, which gives the President a blank check to create 
additional agreements that gut our communities and our economy.

Passing the Peru and Panama Free Trade Agreements puts us on a 
slippery slope toward passing the Bush-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, a 
deeply flawed trade deal for working families in both countries.

I just returned from Colombia, and this was my second trip in 7 
months. On these visits I talked with leaders from civil society, 
indigenous groups, organized labor and the political opposition.

Colombia is a great country with wonderful people, a vibrant culture 
and a growing economy. However, Colombia remains the most dangerous 
country in the world for worker advocates. Despite recent progress, the 
Colombian Government has still been unable to protect labor organizers 
from being attacked or killed over any specific


amount of time. The Bush-Colombia Free Trade Agreement will only 
exacerbate those problems. Without real enforceable worker protections, 
increasing numbers of Colombian workers will be forced into sweatshop 
conditions.

The Bush-Colombia FTA will gut Colombia's legitimate agriculture 
sector. Colombian farmers will be forced to compete with subsidized 
crops from the United States. Many farmers will be forced to choose 
between leaving their farms and growing more lucrative drug crops, the 
very drug crops that we see sending drugs up to the United States.

Free traders are going to say that denying Colombia a free-trade 
package, after giving similar agreements to its neighbors, will 
destabilize the Colombian Government and give a victory to Hugo Chavez. 
They are going to say that it sends a terrible message to an important 
ally that we still regard Colombia as a pariah state.

They're going to say that if the worker and environmental protections 
were good enough for Peru and Panama, why not Colombia and Korea?

Here's the bottom line. The Peru and Panama Free Trade Agreements are 
slippery slopes to more downward pressure on wages and benefits, both 
here and abroad.

You want to hear the surest sign that the Bush Free Trade Agreement 
is flawed? He couldn't even pass them when his own party was in control 
of the Congress. The Peru free trade agreement was signed in April of 
2006, and yet the White House couldn't get the Republican majority to 
move it.

Some might say, we can't afford not to sign free trade agreements. 
After all, they say, globalization is here to stay. Trade and 
globalization are here to stay. The question remains, however, can we 
make them work for working families? And I say, yes, we can.

Trade can benefit our economy and the economist of our trading 
partners. We can negotiate deals that create new markets, bring new 
jobs and new prosperity. We can achieve significant new foreign market 
access and reduce our trade deficit. If we stand united for working 
Americans, we can deliver a real new deal on trade, not warmed-over 
promises masquerading as caviar.

Minor adjustments to the NAFTA-style deals are just not good enough. 
No more agreements based on the failed NAFTA model, no more Fast Track 
promotion authority. We cannot give this administration, or future 
ones, a blank check on trade deals that devastate our communities at 
home.

I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get off that 
slippery slope and get on the new path toward trade that promotes 
development and prosperity for all, not just for the wealthy few.

And I thank my colleague, a real leader on this issue, Mr. Michaud, 
for yielding me time.
