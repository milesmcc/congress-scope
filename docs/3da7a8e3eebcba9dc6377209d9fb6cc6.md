Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise to insert into the Congressional 
Record this important article on our colleague Congressman Pete Stark.









[From the Alameda Sun, October 26, 2007]








When Even the Powerful Can't Speak the Truth




 Rep. Fortney ''Pete'' Stark, D-Fremont, the normally calm, 


 grandfatherly and moderate (for the Bay Area) congressman 


 found himself at the center of a rhetorical hornet's nest 


 last week after daring to tell his colleagues that paying for 


 children's health insurance should come before throwing money 


 at President Bush's bungling military adventurism.



 With the president's approval rating at 24 percent, about 


 as low as former President Nixon's was when he left office, 


 according to a Reuters/Zogby poll released last week, it was 


 only too predictable that Bush's few remaining supporters 


 would immediately leap from their foxholes to shoot the 


 messenger.





 The messenger, in this case was Stark. His words were crude 


 and offensive but his frank oration is admirable. Stark could 


 have chosen his words more carefully, a fact the Democratic 


 leadership made apparent when they dragged him behind the 


 woodshed. But love him or hate him, Stark had the guts to 


 speak in a way that most of his 434 colleagues won't.



 Stark cut through the vapid pablum that passes for 


 political debate in this country; the junk-food rhetoric 


 composed by spin-doctors, tested by focus groups, and 


 proofread by campaign consultants and lobbyists. Just listen 


 to what emanates from the mouths of the leading candidates of 


 both parties in the lead up to November 2008. Or watch the 


 drivel passed off as incisive political coverage on the 24-


 hour cable TV stations. Whether it's Hillary, Romney, 


 Guiliani, Edwards, or McCain, not one policy or word is 


 uttered without first being massaged and sanitized, 


 calculated not to enlighten or lead, but to win votes without 


 offending any demographic.



 Obama, who was catapulted into second place in the polls 


 because he appeared sincere in the spring, has receded after 


 picking up the playbook of ''serious candidate.''



 Stark got into hot water while speaking of the fundamental 


 choice of policy-makers: one framed as ''guns or butter.'' 


 Eventually societies must choose between military spending 


 and the needs of its citizenry.



 The statement was uttered during debate on the House floor 


 following Bush's veto of the popular State Children's Health 


 Care Program (SCHIP), an $11.2 billion annual program that 


 helps poor parents buy health insurance for their children.



 Compare that figure to this week's White House request for 


 $46 billion more to shovel into the quagmires in Iraq and 


 Afghanistan. According to an estimate by the Center for 


 Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, if the above figure is 


 included, by the time the clock runs out on Bush's 


 administration, U.S. taxpayers will be on the hook for $808 


 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 


 That's roughly 10 times what Bush's father spent to humble 


 Saddam Hussein in 1991.



 China won't keep lending us that money forever. Sooner or 


 later, the bill will come due.



 What Stark actually told his colleagues: ''The Republicans 


 are worried that they can't pay for insuring an additional 10 


 million children.''



 ''They sure don't care about finding $200 billion to fight 


 the illegal war in Iraq. Where are you going to get that 


 money? Are you going to tell us lies like you're telling us 


 today? Is that how you're going to fund the war?



 ''You don't have money to fund the (Iraq) war or children. 


 But you're going to spend it to blow up innocent people--if 


 we can get enough kids to grow old enough for you to send to 


 Iraq to get their heads blown off for the president's 


 amusement.''



 These incendiary words launched an explosive backlash from 


 pundits who immediately demanded Stark's head.



 Stark was next criticized by the Democratic Party 


 leadership, but survived a vote of official reprimand that 


 Democrats tabled. Stark then publicly apologized Tuesday 


 saying: ''I want to apologize to my colleagues, many of whom 


 I have offended, to the president, his family, (and) to the 


 troops. I apologize for this reason: I think we have serious 


 issues before us, the issue of providing medical care to 


 children, the issue about what we're going to do about a war 


 that we're divided about how to end.''



 If a U.S. congressman can be shouted down for speaking an 


 essential truth: that blood and treasure is being spilled in 


 a perverse quest by the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania 


 Ave. to outshine the legacy of his own father, these are 


 truly dire days for our republic.



 One wonders what reactions would spew forth from the mouths 


 of those who vilify Stark had they read the words of another 


 great American, a true Republican: Gen. Dwight David 


 Eisenhower:



 ''In the councils of government, we must guard against the 


 acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or 


 unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential 


 for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will 


 persist.



 ''We must never let the weight of this combination endanger 


 our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing 


 for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can 


 compel the proper meshing of huge industrial and military 


 machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so 


 that security and liberty may prosper together.''



 Too bad his warning so quickly landed in the ashcan of 


 history.
