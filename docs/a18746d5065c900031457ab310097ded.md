# TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007
## `a18746d5065c900031457ab310097ded`
`Mr. SESTAK â€” 10 October 2007`

Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill for three 
reasons. First is the cost. As my colleagues have previously said, we 
should have raised from these private agencies at least $44 million to 
$63 million to date. In fact, it has only been $25 million, with a sum 
cost of $51 million.

Second is the more cost-effective way that another agency, the IRS, 
might do this. We know that they have collected this year alone $5.3 
million from the Automated Call Service. Imagine if we had not 
decreased the number of IRS officers from 8,500 during the nineties 
down to only 5,200 today and we had put the money into them or into the 
Automated Call Service. That 20-to-1 return that the government gets 
far exceeds the 4-to-1 return of private agencies.

Third, however, after 31 years in the military, it pained me to see 
us outsource our security operations to


private agencies in Iraq. At times there is abuse, not dissimilar to 
what we hear today, such as seniors and those in Iraq being called. In 
fact, a senior couple was called 150 times, five times a day. Then we 
learned they had the wrong number.

Mr. Speaker, I therefore rise in support of this bill because of the 
cost-effectiveness of the IRS and because of the abuses that can occur 
if it is not within a government agency.
