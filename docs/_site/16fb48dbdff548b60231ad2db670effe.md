Mr. ALTMIRE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor CPT Erick M. 
Foster, an Army Ranger who was killed while serving in Iraq on August 
29, 2007. As a member of the 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 2nd 
Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, he was struck by small 
arms fire while conducting a dismounted patrol in Muqdadiyah, Iraq. 
This was Captain Foster's second deployment to Iraq.

Captain Foster was born and raised in Pennsylvania and graduated from 
North Allegheny High School. After graduation, he attended Duquesne 
University, where he took part in their Reserve Officer Training (ROTC) 
program while majoring in information technology. In 2000, Captain 
Foster graduated from Duquesne University and received his commission 
as an officer in the United States Army.

Captain Foster was awarded the Purple Heart, two Bronze Stars, the 
Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and numerous other 
military awards for his service to our country. He will forever be 
remembered as a patriot and a respected combat leader.

On behalf of my family, the Fourth Congressional District of 
Pennsylvania, and the U.S. House of Representatives, I extend our 
heartfelt sympathy and eternal gratitude to Captain Foster's family. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with his parents, Robert and Barbara, and 
his sisters Elizabeth and Abby.
