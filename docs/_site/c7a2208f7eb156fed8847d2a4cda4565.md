Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend 
from Florida for yielding on this very important bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 940, 
a resolution that recognizes and honors the National Guard on its 373rd 
anniversary. The National Guard has a long and proud history as the 
oldest component of our Armed Forces.

The roots of the National Guard date back to our early colonial and 
State militias, which were vital during the Revolutionary War. It was 
the National Guardsmen who made up the Rough Riders in the Spanish-
American War. More recently, on this date the Japanese attacked Pearl 
Harbor, and the Greatest Generation went to war. And it is fitting that 
we pass this resolution today in memory of all those who served, but in 
particular those who were in the National Guard.

More than 16 million Americans fought in World War II, and about 2 
million of them are still alive today, but they are dying at a rate of 
about 900 a day, according to the Department of Defense. The National 
Guard have made up 40 percent of the U.S. combat divisions and included 
300,000 members and 18 infantry divisions in World War II.

Since the establishment of the National Guard, men and women have 
served valiantly in every American conflict, including our recent 
efforts in the Middle East in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation 
Iraqi Freedom.

As the father of a former National Guardsman who has served in Iraq 
with the Army, I have the greatest respect and gratitude for the 
National Guard


and the job that they perform. Earlier this year, I had the privilege 
to travel to Iraq and Afghanistan to meet many of our soldiers and 
leaders on the ground, and it was there I witnessed the National Guard 
firsthand.

I commend and thank the National Guard and all of our men and women 
in uniform for their selfless service to their country. And I urge my 
colleagues to support the National Guard and our troops and vote in 
favor of this important legislation.
