Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, today's news indicates the Iraqis are 
beginning to be upset that the Bush administration, with the 
unfortunate help of this Congress, is trying to force the sovereign 
Government of Iraq to pass a hydrocarbon act which will give the U.S. 
oil companies control of $6 trillion worth of Iraqi oil assets.

Now, the wealth of Iraq, the oil wells, ought to be decided by an 
Iraq Government not under U.S. occupation. But yet, in the bill that 
was vetoed yesterday, there was a provision that would have forced Iraq 
to have privatized its oil assets or the U.S. would pull our troops 
without having an international security and peacekeeping force in its 
place. That is nothing but extortion.

As Congress comes together to put a plan to get us out of Iraq, let's 
stop trying to steal Iraq's oil. Let's bring our troops home. Let's 
have an international peacekeeping and security force that can come in 
as our troops leave. It is time to take a new direction, and that is 
exactly what H.R. 1234 is about.
