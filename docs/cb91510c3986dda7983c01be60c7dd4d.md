Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

Mr. Chair, for too long the American people have been the victims of 
theft and fraud by contractors working in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 
the past few years, Congress has taken steps to rein these contractors 
in. One of these steps was to create a database to keep information on 
these contractors and their subcontractors. Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, 
they are not entering the information.

My amendment would impose a penalty on those contractors that do not 
comply with the requirement to report this contract information. Their 
noncompliance prevents oversight agencies from conducting proper audits 
and investigations. Therefore, it prevents these agencies from 
uncovering waste and contract fraud. We cannot protect taxpayer dollars 
from theft if we can't follow the money.

Just this week, a witness before the Commission on Wartime 
Contracting said that the contracting environment in our overseas 
operations was highly vulnerable to fraud. The GAO recently reported 
that Federal agencies face difficult challenges in tracking and 
overseeing contractor personnel and contracts.

We have been using contractors in both wars for 9 years now. The 
scale of waste and contract fraud is enormous, and the criminal 
activity is diverse: fraud, bribery, kickbacks, extortion, 
embezzlement, theft of cash or equipment, etc cetera. But we have not 
given our Federal agencies all the tools they need to catch these bad 
actors. We often don't even know who we are doing business with.

This amendment will penalize contractors who do not comply with the 
reporting requirements. Taxpayers are spending billions of dollars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. They deserve accountability.

I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying 
bill.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
